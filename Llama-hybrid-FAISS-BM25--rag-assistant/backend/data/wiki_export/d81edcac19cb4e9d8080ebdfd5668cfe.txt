Early life and education
According to his official biography, Swraj Paul was born in Jullundur, Punjab Province in 1931, in what was then British India.  His father Payare Lal ran a small foundry, making steel buckets and farming equipment. His mother's name was Mongwati. The site of his childhood home is now Apeejay School.

He went to the United States to study mechanical engineering, obtaining BSc, MSc and MechE degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Business career 
After leaving MIT, he returned to India to work for the family business, Apeejay Group, which was founded by his father, and was, at the time, managed by his two older brothers, Satya Paul and Jit Paul.

Caparo Group 
In 1966 he relocated to the United Kingdom to get medical treatment for his young daughter, who had leukaemia. He spent a year grieving her death, after which he founded Natural Gas Tubes. Starting with one steel unit, he went on to acquire more. This led to his founding the Caparo Group in 1968, which became one of the UK's largest steel conversion and distribution businesses, manufacturing an extensive range of structural steels, precision tube, spirally welded tube, special bar qualities, industrial wires, cold rolled strip and spring steel strip. Lord Paul stepped down from the management of the Caparo Group in 1996.

Controversy 
In October 2009  The Sunday Times reported that Lord Paul had been unable satisfactorily to explain claiming expenses of £38,000 for the period January 2005 to July 2006. Lord Paul immediately requested the Clerk of the Parliaments to investigate his expenses at the same time repaying £41,982, instead of £26,988, £15,000, more than the House of Lords would have requested at the conclusion of their investigation. A refund of the difference was never issued by the House of Lords. The Metropolitan Police opened an investigation concerning these expense claims, but by the end of February 2010 concluded there was no case.  Lord Paul appeared before various committees for Lord's Conduct with ultimately the Privileges Committee concluding that Lord Paul had not acted dishonestly or in bad faith.  They did determine however that he had been negligent and acted in ignorance and that his actions did render him liable to sanction by the House." Lord Paul's suspension was for four months.  Lord Paul completely disagreed with their finding, calling it "unreasonable." Lord Paul gave a   Speech in the House of Lords in June 2011 calling for reform and revision of the structure of the constitution.

Paul tendered his resignation as Deputy Speaker to the Lord Speaker on 1 November 2010. His letter, printed in The House Magazine a week later, expressed his reservations about the process, calling it "a sad saga for parliamentary democracy – an unfortunate series of events having evidently been inspired by the electoral politics of the media". He has spoken on this topic many times since the expenses scandal initially made news, and maintains that no wrongdoing had occurred in his case.

Personal life
Lord Paul is on the Sunday Times Rich List as the 38th richest person in Britain, although he claims to take public transport in London "like everybody else". Since the 1960s he has lived in Portland Place, in central London. He and his family own a dozen flats in the block, each one worth close to a million pounds.

His son Angad Paul, CEO of Caparo plc, died after falling from his Marylebone penthouse flat on 8 November 2015. A police statement stated they considered there to be no suspicious circumstances.
