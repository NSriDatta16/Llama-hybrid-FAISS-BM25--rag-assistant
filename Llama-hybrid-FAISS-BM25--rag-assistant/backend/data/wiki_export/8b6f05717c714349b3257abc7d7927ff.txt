Cherryvalley is a former electoral ward of Belfast City Council, Northern Ireland.

Along with neighbouring Stormont and Malone in south Belfast, Cherryvalley is considered one of  Northern Ireland's most affluent and exclusive residential areas with average house prices reaching £2-3m. Cherryvalley was also an electoral ward of East Belfast which was created in 1985 in order to reduce the electorates of the neighbouring Stormont and Shandon wards.

The residents of the area have long been the subject of jest in Northern Ireland, being seen to talk with an affected posh accent. This was popularised by the comedian James Young with his "Cherryvalley Lady" sketch, comparable to the English Hyacinth Bucket.

During World War II German prisoners of war were interned in the area, on the site now occupied by the headquarters of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

In 2005 a property in the area, which was owned by estate agent Philip Johnston and rented by UDA member Jim Gray, was the subject of a PSNI investigation into money laundering.
