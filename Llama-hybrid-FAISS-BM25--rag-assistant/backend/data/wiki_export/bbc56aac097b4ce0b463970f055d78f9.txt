Kilmaurs railway station is a railway station in the town of Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the Glasgow South Western Line.

History 
The original Kilmaurs station was opened on 26 June 1873 by the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway. The buildings on the Up platform (the platform for trains to Kilmarnock and the South) were destroyed by fire in 1914 and replaced by a brick building which, until its closure in 1966, was the only one in south west Scotland to be centrally heated. To the south of the station, a signal box containing 17 levers controlled the section and allowed access to a goods yard.

The station officially closed on 7 November 1966. The current station opened on 12 May 1984 by British Rail.

Platform extension work started in September 2009 to cater for longer units associated with the track doubling works between Stewarton and Lugton.

Being so close to Kilmarnock station the guards often failed to sell tickets to all passengers travelling to Kilmarnock. In 2012 a ticket machine was installed at the station.
