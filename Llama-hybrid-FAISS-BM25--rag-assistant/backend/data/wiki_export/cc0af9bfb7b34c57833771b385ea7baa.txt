She was attached to Escort Group R, and sailed from Alexandria as part of the escort for Convoy MWF 36, returning to Alexandria the next day to escort follow-up Convoy MWS 36. She then sailed to Syracuse for further support duties.

In September Hursley was attached to the Levant Flotilla to support military operations in the Dodecanese Campaign to occupy various Italian-occupied Greek islands after the armistice with Italy. Hursley remained on operations in the Aegean until 2 November, when she was transferred to the Royal Hellenic Navy and renamed Kriti ("Crete").

Kriti

Despite her new name and new crew, the ship remained part of the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, and in January 1944 was assigned to duties escorting convoys from North Africa to Naples in preparation for the planned Allied landings at Anzio ("Operation Shingle"). She was attached to the Southern Attack Force ("Force X-Ray") under U.S. Navy command to support the landing by the U.S. VI Corps. On 20 January she sailed from Naples and two days later, as the troops went ashore, provided support despite enemy air attacks. Kriti remained at Anzio into February providing defence for military convoys and fire support for ground troops.

She sailed from Naples on 12 August as part of the escort of Convoy SF2, which comprised 38 LCIs, arriving at "Delta Beach" (Saint-Tropez) two days later.

Kriti resumed her usual duties in September, but was transferred to the British Aegean Force to support military operations to re-occupy the Aegean islands and Greek mainland. In November she was transferred to the Greek 12th Flotilla at Piraeus, and was engaged in supporting military operations in the Aegean until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.
