"I Saw the Light" is a song written and performed by American musician Todd Rundgren that was released as the opening track from his 1972 album Something/Anything? In the album's liner notes, Rundgren states that he intended the song to be the hit of the album, and copied the Motown tradition of putting hit songs at the beginning of albums. 

Rundgren wrote the track in 20 minutes, a feat he attributes to his reliance on stimulants such as Ritalin. "It caused me to crank out songs at an incredible pace. You can see why, too, the rhymes are just moon/June/spoon kind of stuff."

Appearances
"I Saw The Light" features in the first episode of the Sex and the City spinoff And Just Like That..., and the films My Girl, Kingpin, American Hustle, A Very Murray Christmas, and Licorice Pizza, when the main character, Gary sees Alana with his former co-star Lance.

The song is also heard in season 3, episode 11 of Six Feet Under and season 4, episode 11 of Ozark. It is featured on Supernatural Season 10, episode 19. 

In 2022, the song was featured in advertisements for the UK gambling website Gala Bingo.

"I Saw The Light" was featured twice on the Amazon Prime miniseries Daisy Jones & The Six, with the song being heard in Episode 2 and as the title of Episode 4.
