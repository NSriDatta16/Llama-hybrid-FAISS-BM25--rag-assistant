Dogs in Canada was a print magazine published by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) from 1889â€“2012. The publication was initially titled Canadian Kennel Gazette, later becoming Kennel and Bench, and finally, Dogs In Canada. Issues were published on a monthly basis, along with an annual edition.

History and profile
Founded in 1889, Dogs in Canada is one of the oldest continually-published magazines in Canada. It began as a newsletter owned by Apex Publishing Ltd, a subsidiary of the CKC. The magazine originally focused purely on pedigree dogs and dog shows.  A subscription was previously included in the price of membership of the CKC.  

Due to a change in editorial direction, Dogs in Canada abandoned its focus on dog breeding, and became a general-interest dog magazine, aimed at pet owners.  After the shift in content proved to be financially disastrous, subsequent changes in editorial staff returned the magazine to its original focus.

In 2011, the Canadian Kennel Club decided to close its publishing arm, Apex Publishing, citing the worsening financial state of the publishing industry. The December 2011 edition and 2012 annual were the final publications of Dogs in Canada. However, the CKC maintains a digital archive for its members.
