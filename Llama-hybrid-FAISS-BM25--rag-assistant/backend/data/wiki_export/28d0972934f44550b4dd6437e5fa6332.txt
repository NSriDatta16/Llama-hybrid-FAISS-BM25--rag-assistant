Christophe Roger-Vasselin (; born 8 July 1957) is a French former professional tennis player.

Notably in his singles career, he reached the French Open semifinals in 1983, beating No. 1 seed Jimmy Connors in the quarterfinals, but lost to eventual champion Yannick Noah.  The right-hander reached his highest singles ATP ranking on 20 June 1983, when he became world No. 29.

Roger-Vasselin won two doubles titles during his professional career.

In the autumn of 1977 he briefly played with a double-strung racket, the so-called spaghetti racket, with which he reached the final of the Porée Cup in Paris. The racket was banned shortly afterwards.

His son Édouard Roger-Vasselin followed him into the profession and is currently active on the ATP Tour, and went on to win the French Open in doubles in 2014.
