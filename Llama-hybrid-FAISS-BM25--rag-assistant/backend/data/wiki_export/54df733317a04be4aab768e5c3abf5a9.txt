Dominican Rock (known as "Rock Dominicano" in Dominican Republic) is rock music created by Dominican groups and soloists. It was introduced to the country in the 1960s by the musician Milton Peláez. The genre became more popular years later with the start of Luis Dias' band Transporte Urbano, successful bands such as Tribu Del Sol, Toque Profundo and Tabu Tek began to emerge. Dominican rock is listened to by the youth of the Dominican Republic who have embraced the music, sometimes over merengue and bachata.
Rita Indiana y los Misterios are a musical group known for their blend of traditional merengue music with rock.
