Westboro Baptist Church protest 
In April 2011, the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, protested against Meade High School, claiming that the school had a high number of homosexual students. When the group revisited the county in March 2012, it was brought to the attention of many Anne Arundel County residents, and a crowd of about 500 people showed up and protested Westboro Baptist Church. Meade is one of three high schools in Maryland to be protested by the Westboro Baptist Church, the other two being Glen Burnie High School, also in Anne Arundel County, and Walt Whitman High School of Montgomery County.

Past problems 
Meade Senior High School's reputation among Anne Arundel County schools was poor as of 2007, with some parents and students in disagreement. This negative reputation stems from events in 2005, when former Principal Joan Valentine was accused of blocking efforts to investigate the beating of a single white student by ten to fifteen black students in January of that year.

Near the end of the 2006–2007 year, during the final day of exams, around twenty students became involved in a physical altercation which resulted in the involvement of police forces from multiple jurisdictions and minor injuries to policemen. A group of parents lodged complaints against the police for roughing up their children.

On September 30, 1994, a brawl started that injured three teachers and six students. Media specialist and Senior Class advisor, Don Gobbi, attempted to break up the fight and was punched and thrown to the floor. As he lay in the fetal position students began to kick him. Gobbi was flown by Maryland State Helicopter to Maryland Medical Center shock trauma. Teacher John O'Neill also attempted to break up the fight and was taken to North Arundel Hospital with minor injuries. The third teacher was not hospitalized. Gobbi was released from the hospital later that day and never returned to his position at the school.
