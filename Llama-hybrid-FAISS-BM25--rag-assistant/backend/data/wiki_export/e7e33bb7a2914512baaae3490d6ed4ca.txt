The ridge scaled rattail or ridge-scaled grenadier, Macrourus carinatus, is a species of deep-water fish in the family Macrouridae. It has southern circumglobal distribution in temperate to subantarctic waters (34°S–65°S) and is found in the Southern Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and in the Southern Ocean at depths of about .

Description and life history
Macrourus carinatus can reach  in total length and about  in pre-anal length. The eyes are relatively large. The snout is short and moderately pointed. Coloration is medium brown to somewhat straw color, with darker, sometimes even blackish fins.

In the waters of the Falkland Islands, females reach 50% maturity at  pre-anal length and 14 years of age. Males reach 50% maturity at  pre-anal length and 12 years of age. Spawning occurs throughout the year but peaks during the austral autumn (April–July). Females also have a larger asymptotic pre-anal length than males, , respectively. Maximum recorded age is 53 years.
