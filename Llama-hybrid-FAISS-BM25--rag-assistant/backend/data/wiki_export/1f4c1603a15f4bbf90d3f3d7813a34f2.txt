William Samuel Frieder (born March 3, 1942) is a former basketball coach at Michigan (1981–1989) and Arizona State (1989–1997). Frieder's 1985–86 team was the last Michigan team to win a Big Ten Championship until the 2011–12 team. 

Just before the 1989 NCAA tournament, Frieder announced that he would leave Michigan for Arizona State at the end of the season. Michigan athletic director Bo Schembechler ordered Frieder to leave immediately, and named top assistant Steve Fisher as the interim coach for the tournament. Schembechler famously announced, "A Michigan man will coach Michigan, not an Arizona State man." The Wolverines went on to win the tournament and Fisher was officially given the head coaching job. Michigan credits the 1988–89 team's regular season to Frieder and the NCAA tournament to Fisher. 

Frieder resigned from Arizona State in 1997 following a point-shaving scandal that involved games from the school’s 1994 season.

Personal
Frieder is a 1964 graduate of the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
