The School of Pharmacy is a professional school of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, within the Faculty of Science. It was previously housed in Faculty of Science buildings on the main university campus in Waterloo, but was re-located to a new $34 million building on the university's Health Sciences Campus in downtown Kitchener in 2008.

It is the only pharmacy school in Canada that offers co-operative education.

It was designed by Siamak Hariri of Hariri Pontarini Architects and Robbie/Young + Wright Architects of Toronto, Ontario in 2008. The building facade features wood, brick, stone, COR-TEN steel while the glass windows feature images, painted by artist Sky Glabush, of common plants used in the historical development of pharmaceuticals.
