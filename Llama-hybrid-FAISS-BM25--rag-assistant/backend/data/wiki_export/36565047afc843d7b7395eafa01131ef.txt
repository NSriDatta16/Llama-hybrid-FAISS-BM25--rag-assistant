Wadada Magic is the second studio album by the band Suns of Arqa, recorded and released in 1983 by Antler Records.  The album was produced by Suns of Arqa founder Michael Wadada.

The spine of the LP reads "Suns of Arqa Vol III   Wadada Magic".  The style on this album is quite different from their debut album Revenge of the Mozabites, and the tracks are more dance-oriented.  Some of the tracks from this album (A1-A3, B1, B2, B4) were made available on CD in 1992 on the compilation Arqaology, released on Arka Sound.

On Arqaology, tracks A1, A2 here are combined as one, as are tracks B1, B2.  Track B3 appears on Arqaology in truncated form (just 22 seconds!), however, it appears in full on their later album Magiczna Miłość.

The sleevenotes for this LP includes a dedication to Alice and Harry Ward, presumably relatives of Michael Ward (Wadada).
