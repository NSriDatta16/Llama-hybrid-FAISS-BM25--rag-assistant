The Chaoyang Park Beach Themed Park (), known as the Chaoyang Park Beach Volleyball Ground () during the 2008 Olympic Games, is a swimming, samba, African dance, hula and carnival place in Chaoyang Park that used to be one of 9 temporary venues used for the 2008 Summer Olympics. It was built on the site of the ex-Beijing Gas Appliance Factory () but now a part of the park. The ground was used for the beach volleyball matches.

The venue had a capacity of 12,000, consisting of 1 competition ground, 2 warmup grounds, and 6 training grounds. Court 2 was used on Day 6 of competition.

After the Olympics, the venue hosted the Beijing Grand Slam of the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour in 2011 and 2012. It also hosted the Beijing Ocean-Beach Carnival every summer since 2009.
