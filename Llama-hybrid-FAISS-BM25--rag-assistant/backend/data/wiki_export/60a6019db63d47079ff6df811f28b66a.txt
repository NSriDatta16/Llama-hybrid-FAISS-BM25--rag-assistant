Another Fine Day is Golden Smog's third full-length album. It was released on July 18, 2006. It reached number 95 on the Billboard 200 chart.

Background
Golden Smog's lineup was chiefly made up of Kraig Johnson (Run Westy Run), Dan Murphy (Soul Asylum) Jeff Tweedy (Wilco) and Gary Louris and bassist Marc Perlman (both of The Jayhawks). It had been 8 years since 1998's Weird Tales release by the group. In the meantime, the Jayhawks broke up and Soul Asylum went on hiatus. Tweedy's band Wilco had achieved success with albums such as Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born.

Another Fine Day features vocals by Tweedy, Murphy and Louris. It included a cover version of The Kinks' 1970 song "Strangers".

Reception

Writing for Allmusic, music critic Mark Deming wrote of the album "Another Fine Day sounds less scattershot and more unified than Golden Smog's earlier efforts, which makes sense since the core of this band had been working together for years, and the results seem less like a genially thrown-together side project than the work of a real band. The only drawback for fans is this Golden Smog doesn't bear much aural resemblance to the band that made Down by the Old Mainstream and Weird Tales; then again, the bands who make up Golden Smog's membership don't sound much like they did back then, either, so that shouldn't come as much of a surprise." Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media writes "the relaxed spirit of the album's predecessors remains, even as the sound has grown a little bit more rock'n'roll. Non-supergroup supergroups at least aren't likely collar-poppers, but that doesn't mean they're always perversely super; sometimes strangely fine is enough for family fun."
