The Darkwar Saga is a series of fantasy novels by the American writer  Raymond E. Feist.

Concept
In Feist's fantasy novels, a riftwar is war between two worlds that are connected by some sort of dimensionless gap (a rift). In his invented history there are several riftwars. The first riftwar between Midkemia and Kelewan is described in the trilogy The Riftwar Saga. This saga is a continuation of Feist's preceding works and so far suggests an upcoming, fourth riftwar. Feist has confirmed that there are five riftwars in total. The Darkwar will be followed by the Demonwar and Chaoswar.
