Gounder is a title used by various communities in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It may refer to various unrelated communities such as Vettuva Gounders., Kongu Vellalars, Tuluva Vellalars, Urali Gounders, Kurumba, Vanniyars, and Vokkaligas.

Etymology
There are number of derivations for the title. One theory derives it from the Tamil word Kaamindan, meaning "noble protector of the country", later modified as Kavundan or Gounder.

According to S. N. Sadasivan, the Tamil  Vellalars branched off from the Vokkaligas and both might have a common origin from the Kurumba.

History
During the British Raj era, some Gounders migrated to Malayan rubber plantations as Kanganis to manage the coolies.
