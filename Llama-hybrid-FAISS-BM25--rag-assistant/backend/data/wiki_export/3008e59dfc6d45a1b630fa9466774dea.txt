Samuel David Koch ( ; born August 13, 1982) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire 16-year career as a punter for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers and was selected by the Ravens in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He is known for developing many punting variations, revolutionizing his position in the process.

Early years
Koch attended Seward High School in Seward, Nebraska and played punter, kicker, tight end, offensive lineman, fullback, and linebacker for Coach Greg Welch and the football team. Along with football, Koch played basketball, baseball, and soccer.

College career
Koch walked on to the Nebraska football team, where he played punter, and later would receive a scholarship before the start of the 2004 season. He did not see game action as a redshirt freshman in 2002, but served as the backup punter. As a sophomore in 2003, he backed up Kyle Larson at punter, but did not attempt a punt. Koch was Nebraska’s punter from 2004–05 after holding kickoff duties for 7 games in 2003. He was named to the 2005 2nd-team Academic All-Big 12 squad and the 2005 Big 12 Commissioner’s Spring and Fall Academic Honor Roll. He racked up a career-punting average of 44.1 yards (with 56 kicks inside the 20 and a long of 84 yards). As a senior, Koch put together the best campaign ever at his position in school history, as he broke the single-season punting average mark with a 46.5-yard average in 2005. The 2005 average bested the previous record of 45.1 yards per punt by former Bengals punter Kyle Larson in 2003. Koch’s average ranked second nationally and helped Nebraska to a No. 2 national ranking in net punting (39.9 avg.) As a senior, he was a semifinalist for the Ray Guy Award. In his collegiate finale in the 2005 Alamo Bowl, Koch posted a 51.5-yard average on 8 punts against Michigan, including 5 punts over 50 yards each. He connected on at least 1 punt of 50 yards or more in 8 of 11 contests and surpassed the 48-yard barrier in every single game. He was the Huskers’ kickoff specialist for the 2nd half of the season and 18 of his 32 kickoffs resulted in touchbacks. In his final 6 games, opponents had just 10 returns totaling 165 yards. In December 2005, he earned a degree in business administration.
