Team mascot and colors

The Tamaraw is the mascot of all FEU athletic teams. Known scientifically as Bubalus mindorensis, it is a rare animal found only in the island of Mindoro. The local endemic animal was chosen originally by the FEU founder, Dr. Nicanor Reyes Sr., for his admiration of its strength and intelligence. The Tamaraw icon has eventually transformed into a nationalistic and culturally significant symbol for ferociousness. 

The team's color are that of the university, green and gold. With green representing hope, as quoted from the National Hero, Dr. Jose Rizal's "Fair hope of the Fatherland", and gold, representing the university's golden opportunity to serve the youth and country.

Rivals
UE Red Warriors were involved in the rivalry called the "Battle of the East" with the FEU Tamaraws. Both the Red Warriors and the Tamaraws dominated the UAAP basketball tournaments from the 1950s up to the late 1980s. The Tamaraws came out on top of this rivalry having won 20 titles to the 18 titles of the Red Warriors.
De La Salle Green Archers rivalry was sparked during the finals of season 54 (1991) when La Salle's win in game 1 (where La Salle was twice-to-beat) was protested by FEU. The UAAP board upheld the protest and ordered the replay. La Salle did not show up, claiming to have won legitimately. This resulted in the awarding of the championship trophy to FEU by the UAAP board. La Salle responded with a victory parade that passed through the other seven UAAP schools. When they passed through the FEU campus, the motorcade was bombarded with debris. In season 67 (2004), La Salle had to give up another trophy to FEU. Two Green Archers were found to have falsified documents, thus the trophy was awarded again to FEU, who were the finals opponent of La Salle. The rivalry is unofficially known as the "Battle of the Greens", because both teams sport green in their uniforms.
