Jools' Annual Hootenanny is a TV show presented by Jools Holland and broadcast on New Year's Eve as an end-of-year special edition of his series Later... with Jools Holland. It is generally broadcast between approximately 11pm on 31 December and between 1am and 2am the following morning in the United Kingdom on BBC Two.

The advance-recorded show features a Hogmanay party atmosphere with all the guests (drawn from across the world of showbusiness) and other guest audience members present, and the artists themselves getting involved alongside a variety of musical acts by the artists from various genres who perform both before and after midnight. There is a countdown to the midnight start of the New Year, followed by a traditional rendition of "Auld Lang Syne", often with the Pipes and Drums of the Scots Guards. Among the regular events of the evening is the spot where Holland asks actors and comedians Rowland Rivron and Vic Reeves their predictions for the year ahead/their New Year's resolutions. Editions also feature a white-suited man with a clock for a face named Father Time or Clockman.

Production 
The show is pre-recorded, but is presented as if live, with a countdown to midnight and references to the new calendar year. The BBC has described the show as "an idealised New Year's Eve party with a line-up that would surely be impossible to deliver on 31 December".

2006/07 edition 
Acts that appeared in 2006/07 included the Zutons and Seasick Steve. Comedian Adrian Edmondson, a regular on the show, was joined by Jools and his band to perform a swing version of the Sex Pistols song "Anarchy in the U.K." Also appearing on the show was Amy Winehouse collaborating with Paul Weller on two tracks, "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and "Don't Go to Strangers", originally recorded by Etta Jones.

Kate Rusby sang "Fare Thee Well" as midnight struck, accompanied by the 1st Battalion Scots Guards.
