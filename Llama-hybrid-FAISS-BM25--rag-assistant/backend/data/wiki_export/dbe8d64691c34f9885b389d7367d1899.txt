Li Jiajun (; born October 15, 1975, in Changchun, Jilin) is a former Chinese short track speed skater who has won 5 Olympic medals â€“ two silver and three bronze. He has been a two-time Overall World Champion for 1999 and 2001.

Biography
In 1998 Winter Olympics, he led for much of the way during the final race of the 1000m, but was edged out at the finish-line by Korea's Kim Dong-Sung, to win a silver medal. He also won a bronze medal in 5000m relay.

He participated in the 2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake City, making the finals of the 1000 meter short course event but failed to win a medal after being disqualified following a collision with Apolo Ohno, which caused Ahn Hyun-Soo and Mathieu Turcotte to also fall and allowed Australian Steven Bradbury to claim the gold medal.

During the opening ceremony of the 2007 Asian Winter Games, Li was given the honour to light the torch. As of August 18, 2006, he officially retired from short track speedskating.  According to Li, he went to study in Canada later that year and continued his work as the assistant coach for the national team.
