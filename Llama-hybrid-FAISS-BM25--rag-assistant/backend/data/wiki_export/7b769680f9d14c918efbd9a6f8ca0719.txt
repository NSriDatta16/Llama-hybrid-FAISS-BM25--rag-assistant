State Highway 63 (SH 63) is a highway in east Texas that runs from Zavalla through Jasper, continuing east to the Louisiana state line. The route is proposed to become an extension of I-14 in the future.

History
The highway was originally designated on August 21, 1923 along the easternmost branch of previously numbered SH 7 from Zavalla southeast to Bon Wier. On September 26, 1939, the section from Jasper to Bon Wier was transferred to U.S. Highway 190, while SH 63 was rerouted northeast to the Louisiana state line via Burkeville, replacing part of SH 45. This is its current routing.

Future
As part of the I-14 System in Texas project, SH 63 between Jasper and Louisiana state line is proposed to be upgraded to interstate standards and become I-14.
