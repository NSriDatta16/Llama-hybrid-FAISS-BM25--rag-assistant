He wrote "Aruba Dushi Tera", a waltz that is now the national anthem for Aruba and was long a rallying cry for separation from the Netherlands Antilles, which was achieved in 1986.

His music was featured in the 2013 film Abo So.

Juan Chabaya Lampe died on November 28, 2019, at his home in Oranjestad, Aruba, aged 99.
