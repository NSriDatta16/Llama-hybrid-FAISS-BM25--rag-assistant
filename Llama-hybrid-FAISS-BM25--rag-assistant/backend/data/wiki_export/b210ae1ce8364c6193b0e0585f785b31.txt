He directed the film The Woods, which was released on DVD October 3, 2006.  Lucky McKee also co-directed the hard-to-find horror film All Cheerleaders Die, which is not currently in print.

McKee optioned Jack Ketchum's novel The Lost and produced the film adaptation directed by Chris Sivertson.

Shooting was halted when Red was almost completed, with McKee as director, in December, 2006. Shooting resumed in Maryland following a hiatus of more than six months, with a different director, Norwegian Trygve Allister Diesen. No explanation has been offered for the shared directing credit.
