Hillsborough Community College (HCC) is a public community college in Hillsborough County, Florida. It is part of the Florida College System.

History 
HCC was one of the last community colleges to be created in Florida, founded in 1968. Only Pascoâ€“Hernando State College, out of the 28-school Florida community college system, was founded later.

In January 2008 the school opened its first residence hall, Hawk's Landing, named after the school mascot. This marks HCC as one of the few community colleges with its own residence hall.

Campus 
The college has five campuses located throughout the county.  Locations include: Brandon, Dale Mabry, Plant City, Ybor City, and South Shore (on the south shore of Tampa Bay in Ruskin); with the Dale Mabry campus being the largest. There are also instructional centers at MacDill Air Force Base (South Tampa/aligned with the Plant City Campus) and at the Regent (Riverview) aligned with the Brandon Campus.  Administrative offices and headquarters are located on Davis Islands, near downtown Tampa. HCC has over 80 campus clubs, groups and organizations available.

Academics 
HCC has grown to include over 43,000 students. In 2010, HCC ranked 8th in the state and 20th in the nation in total number of associate degrees produced. HCC houses the Honors Institute.
