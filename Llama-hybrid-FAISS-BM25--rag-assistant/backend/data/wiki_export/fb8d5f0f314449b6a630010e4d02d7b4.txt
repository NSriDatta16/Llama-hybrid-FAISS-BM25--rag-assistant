Foreign Exchange

The university offers a fifteen-week intensive course in Korean language and culture. This program is tuition-free to all accepted students. Exchange students room with a Korean student at Geumgang University, and engage in four hours per week of English coaching while in the program. Each year, approximately 25 foreign students attend the language program. Geumgang University also has a student exchange program with the University of the West, a Buddhist-founded university in the United States.

There are many foreign faculty members as well. The Information Science department is 2/3 foreign faculty, with professors from Yale and Columbia.

A temple-stay program is under construction and will be available in July 2016.
