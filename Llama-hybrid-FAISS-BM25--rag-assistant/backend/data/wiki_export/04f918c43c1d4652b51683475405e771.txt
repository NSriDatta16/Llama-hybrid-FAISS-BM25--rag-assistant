is a Japanese manga anthology magazine published by Ichijinsha. It began as a quarterly publication in July 2005, but was issued bimonthly on odd months from January 2011 to December 2016, when it became monthly. Kanako Umezawa has served as Comic Yuri Hime's Editor-in-Chief since 2017.

It is the successor to Yuri Shimai and features manga with the same yuri (lesbian) themes. Comic Yuri Hime was financially dependent upon Monthly Comic Zero Sum, but from 2008 on the magazine has become independent. To celebrate this, the eleventh volume, released on January 18, 2008, included an extra called Petit Yuri Hime, a collaboration of artists from Comic Yuri Hime, Comic Yuri Hime S and Yuri Hime: Wildrose. Comic Yuri Hime S was Comic Yuri Hime'''s male-targeted sister magazine.
