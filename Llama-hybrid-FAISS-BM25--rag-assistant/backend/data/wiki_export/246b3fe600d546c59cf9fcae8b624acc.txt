Elizabeth Stewart, 2nd Countess of Moray suo jure (Late 1565 – 18 November 1591), was the daughter of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray and Agnes Keith.

She was born at St Andrews while her father was in exile in England following the Chaseabout Raid, a rebellion against Mary, Queen of Scots.

On 23 January 1581 she married James Stewart, son of James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune, and they had five children: The wedding was celebrated on 31 January in Fife with a tournament of "running at the ring" and James VI of Scotland took part. Two day after the party came to Leith, where a water pageant culminated with an assault on a pasteboard Papal Castel Sant'Angelo, built on boats on the water of Leith. Some of her father's friends relatives thought the Lord Doune's son was not of sufficient status to marry her. 

She died in childbirth in November 1591.
