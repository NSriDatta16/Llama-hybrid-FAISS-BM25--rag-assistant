Mutantes () is the second album by the Brazilian tropicalia band Os Mutantes. The album was originally released in 1969 (see 1969 in music) and reissued in 1999 on Omplatten Records and again in 2006 by Omplatten's (and Polydor's) parent company, Universal Records. It shows a more polished approach than their first album, maintaining the sense of humour while keeping the experimental aspects, such as fusing different genres, studio trickery as well as using found objects and samples from television and movies.

It was listed by Rolling Stone Brazil at #44 on the 100 best Brazilian albums in history list. One of its singles, "2001", was also voted by the magazine as the 90th greatest Brazilian song.
