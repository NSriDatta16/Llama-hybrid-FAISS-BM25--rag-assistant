Rolleston station is around half a mile from the small village of Rolleston, one of the Trent side villages close to Southwell in Nottinghamshire, England. The station is convenient for Southwell Racecourse, to which it is adjacent.

History
The station was opened on 4 August 1846 with services running between Nottingham and Lincoln.

The branch line to Southwell was opened in 1847 but the Midland Railway suspended passenger services to Southwell for a while during the 1850s. These were restored from 1 August 1860 as the Midland Railway saw demand for a planned new line through Southwell to Mansfield.

On Saturday 5 December 1874, John Bradwell, senior church warden at Southwell Minster, stopped on the foot crossing and being very deaf did not hear an approaching train which knocked him down. The station master arranged for him to be taken by train to Newark but as the local surgeon arrived at Newark station, the victim had died from his injuries. The recommendation from the inquest was that a footbridge be installed. 

The station was previously known as Rolleston Junction, as it used to be the junction for the railway line to Southwell and Mansfield, which in its latter years played host to the locally loved 'Southwell Paddy' service. This line closed to passengers in June 1959, although the service beyond Southwell ended three decades earlier. The name also avoided confusion with Rolleston-on-Dove railway station on the line between Burton upon Trent and Egginton Junction.
