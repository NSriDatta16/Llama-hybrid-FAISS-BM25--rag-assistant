In number theory, the Dedekind psi function is the multiplicative function on the positive integers defined by

where the product is taken over all primes  dividing  (By convention, , which is the empty product, has value 1.) The function was introduced by Richard Dedekind in connection with modular functions.

The value of  for the first few integers  is:

1, 3, 4, 6, 6, 12, 8, 12, 12, 18, 12, 24, ... .

The function  is greater than  for all  greater than 1, and is even for all  greater than 2. If  is a square-free number then , where  is the divisor function.

The  function can also be defined by setting  for powers of any prime , and then extending the definition to all integers by multiplicativity. This also leads to a proof of the generating function in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which is

This is also a consequence of the fact that we can write as a Dirichlet convolution of .

There is an additive definition of the psi function as well. Quoting from Dickson,

R. Dedekind proved that, if  is decomposed in every way into a product  and if  is the g.c.d. of  then
 

where  ranges over all divisors of  and  over the prime divisors of  and  is the totient function.

Higher orders
The generalization to higher orders via ratios of Jordan's totient is

with Dirichlet series

.

It is also the Dirichlet convolution of a power and the square
of the Möbius function,

.

If

is the characteristic function of the squares, another Dirichlet convolution
leads to the generalized σ-function,
