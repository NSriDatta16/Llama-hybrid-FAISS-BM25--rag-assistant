Stephen Parker Leatherman, also known as Dr. Beach, (born November 6, 1947) is an American geoscientist, coastal ecologist, and author. He was the first director of the International Hurricane Research Center at Florida International University (FIU), from 1997 to 2009. He then became professor and co-director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at FIU. Leatherman often discuss his research on beach quality evaluations, beach erosion, coastal storm and sea level rise impacts and rip currents.

Education
Leatherman earned his Ph.D. in environmental (coastal) sciences from the University of Virginia in 1976 and a B.S. degree in geosciences from North Carolina State University in 1970. He served in the United States Army from 1970 to 1972, mostly in the Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) in Hanover, New Hampshire.

Beach ratings
Leatherman is known for his annual ratings of the top beaches in the United States where he releases a list each Memorial Day weekend since 1991, which is based on 50 criteria scored on a five-point scale. His #1 beach for 2020 was Grayton Beach in the Florida panhandle and for 2021 was Hapuna Beach State Park in Hawaii and 2022 was Ocracoke Lifeguarded Beach on Ocracoke Island, Outer Banks, North Carolina.

Coastal Science

Stephen Leatherman has produced 20 books and National Academy reports and more than 200 refereed journal articles and technical reports, including articles in both Science and Nature on coastal science and public policy.
