The members of the first Iraqi Council of Representatives were elected in December 2005 under the newly adopted constitution.

The main functions of the Council were to:

 Elect the first permanent government of Iraq since the invasion and occupation of Iraq by United States and allied forces in 2003
 Discuss amendments to the constitution
 Implement various element of the constitution including nominating members of the judiciary, resolving the status of Kirkuk and establishing Regions.

Votes chose between coalition lists, and seats were allocated according to a formula that considered first the proportion of votes received in each governorate and then allocated compensatory national seats to those lists where the governorate seats did not reflect their share of the national vote. Individual members were then nominated by the lists.

Where members of the Council of Representative are appointed to the Council of Ministers or the Presidency Council they have to resign their seat and the coalition list must appoint a replacement member. The same is the case if a member dies, resigns, is disqualified or incapacitated or is deemed to have "committed a crime against the constitution"
