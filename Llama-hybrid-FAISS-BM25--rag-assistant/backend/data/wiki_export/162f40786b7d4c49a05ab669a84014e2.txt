Major intersections

Special routes

PA 18 Truck (Washington)

Pennsylvania Route 18 Truck is a truck route of PA 18 that is located near Washington, Pennsylvania.

The westbound exits and entrances of I-70 lead to a narrow street (called East Wylie Avenue) connecting to PA 18, thus making it harder for trucks to access PA 18.  So, it follows I-70 west.  It exits at exit 16, following Sheffield Street.  Then, it creates a U-Turn back onto I-70 east and exits off PA 18.

PA 18 Truck (New Castle)

Pennsylvania Route 18 Truck was a truck route around a weight-restricted bridge over the Shenango River that existed from 2013 to about 2018. The bridge along Mahoning Avenue was prohibited to trucks over 30 tons, necessitating the route.  The route followed PA 108, I-376, US 422, and PA 168. In 2018, the bridge underwent rehabilitation, including the replacement of bearings, and substructure and steel repairs, among other fixes. As a result, the route was deleted upon reconstruction.

PA 18 Business (West Middlesex)

Pennsylvania Route 18 Business was a business route of PA 18 that was established in 1970 when PA 18 was shifted onto the a part of the Beaver Valley Expressway from Exit 2 (PA 18) to the PA 760/PA 18 interchange near West Middlesex, Pennsylvania.  PA 18 Business followed New Castle Road and Sharon Road through the town of West Middlesex.  The route was removed in 1978 when mainline PA 18 was rerouted on its old alignment, removing the need for the business route.
