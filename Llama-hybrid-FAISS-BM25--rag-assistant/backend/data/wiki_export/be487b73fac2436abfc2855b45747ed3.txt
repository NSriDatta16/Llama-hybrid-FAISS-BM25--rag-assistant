Sports
Puthuppally is known for the sport called native ball play which is organized annually. A ball which is made of leather is used. It is generally referred to as naadan panthu kali or tukal panthu Kali. Kerala Native Ball Association's office is located in Puthuppally. This traditional game is facing a slow death as the younger generations do not find it appealing. Usually, the game is played on level grounds and non-availability of playgrounds also contributes to the slow death of the sport. The playground opposite to the Government Boys School on the 'High School Road' is one of the biggest grounds in Puthuppally. Games including Cricket, Football, Native ball play, etc. are played here.
