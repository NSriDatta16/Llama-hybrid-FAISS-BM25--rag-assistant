Early life and education

At thirteen, she began performing with the Mid-Eastern Dance Exchange company, based in Miami Beach. One of her directors at the time was the well-known dancer, Tamalyn Dallal, who had inspired her when she was younger.

Gamal went on to become the first dancer to audition with bellydancing techniques and be accepted at the New World School of the Arts' Performing Arts School. While a senior at the New World School of Arts, Gamal also taught dancing to young children. She trained in other types of dancing, such as ballet, jazz, tap, flamenco and modern, while at that school. 

Gamal graduated with a degree in psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts.
