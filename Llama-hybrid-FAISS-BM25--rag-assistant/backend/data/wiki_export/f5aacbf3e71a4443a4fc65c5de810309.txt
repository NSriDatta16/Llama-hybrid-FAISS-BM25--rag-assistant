The  is the principal railway line on the island of Shikoku in Japan, connecting the major cities of Shikoku, and via the Honshi-Bisan Line, with Honshu. It is operated by the Shikoku Railway Company (JR Shikoku), and is aligned approximately parallel with the Inland Sea coast, connecting the prefectural capitals of Takamatsu (Kagawa Prefecture) and Matsuyama (Ehime Prefecture) and continuing on to Uwajima. The name of the line comes from  and , the old names of Ehime and Kagawa, respectively.

The line consists of two alignments between Mukaibara and Iyo-Ōzu. The original main line follows the coast via Iyo-Nagahama, while the direct line, opened in 1986 as a bypass of the lengthy coastal route, goes through the mountains via Uchiko, part of which is known as the Uchiko Line (as it was originally part of the Uchiko branch), and all limited express trains now use this route.

Until 1988 the Yosan Line, along with the Dosan Line, connected with the Rail Ferry (from Uno) at Takamatsu Station. Direct services from Okayama now operate with the completion of the Great Seto Bridge system, over which the Honshi-Bisan Line travels.

History
The first segment of the line, from Tadotsu to Marugame, was constructed by the Sanuki Railway Co. and commenced operation in 1889. The Marugame - Takamatsu section opened in 1897, and in the company was nationalised in 1906.

The line was extended west from Tadotsu in sections commencing in 1913, reaching Matsuyama in 1927. Further west, a private 762mm (2'6") gauge line was opened from Iyo Nagahama - Iyo Ozu, with the line being privatised in 1933. The line from Matsuyama was extended in sections to Iyo Nagahama between 1927–35, with the former private line being regauged to 1067mm (3'6") gauge in 1935. Further western extensions opened 1936-45, when Uwajima (and the Yodo Line) was connected to the Yosan line.

On August 1, 1933, the entire line was renamed the Yosan Main Line. In 1987, with the privatization of the Japanese National Railways, the line became simply the Yosan Line.

The Takamatsu - Tadotsu section was duplicated 1965-70, and CTC signalling commissioned in 1985 between Takamatsu - Matsuyama. The 'direct line' between Mukaibara - Iyo Ozu (including the 6,012m Inuyose tunnel) opened in 1986, incorporating part of the former Uchicko branch and shortening the route by 6.3 km.

The Takamatsu - Tadotsu section was electrified in 1987, enabling direct Takamatsu - Okayama services when the Seto Ohashi Bridge system opened the following year.

The Iyo Hojo - Matsumoto - Iyoshi section was electrified in 1990, with the Tadotsu - Imabari section being energised in 1992, and the Imabari - Iyo Hojo section in 1993, enabling direct Matsuyama - Okayama electric services to be introduced.

Following the Tohoku major earthquake, JR Shikoku, JR East, and JR Freight announced that JR Shikoku's popular Ampanman Torokko Train would tour areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami.
