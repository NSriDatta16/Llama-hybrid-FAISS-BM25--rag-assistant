Career
The son of racing legend Mark Donohue, David Donohue has accomplished much in a wide variety of auto racing series and classes, including NASCAR's Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series, as well as winning the GT2 class at the 1998 running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Almost exactly 40 years after his father won the 24 Hours of Daytona, David won the 2009 event driving a Brumos-entered Riley-Porsche teamed with Antonio Garc√≠a, Darren Law and Buddy Rice. After starting the race from pole position, Donohue's 0.167-second margin of victory over Juan Pablo Montoya was the closest in the race's history by over a minute, and the closest finish in the history of major international 24-hour motorsports events. In 2013, David Donohue drove in the first GX class race at the 24 hour of Daytona. His car, the #16 Napleton Porsche Cayman S, won by a 9 lap lead.
