Notes

Because he was only 17, and born on 29 August 1980, Nicholas Tse is not allowed to watch the movie when the movie opens in Hong Kong cinemas on 5 June 1998 because this movie is classified as Category III, which is a restricted category in the Hong Kong motion picture rating system and the category is strictly for persons aged 18 and above only.

The story retcons the flashback from the first film, taking place in 1988 rather than 1985.
