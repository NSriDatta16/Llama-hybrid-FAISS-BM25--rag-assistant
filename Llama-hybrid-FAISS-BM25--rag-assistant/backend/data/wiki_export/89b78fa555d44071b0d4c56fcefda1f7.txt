History 
The road which is now Route 192 was constructed under the State Bond Issue bill of 1924 as part of Illinois Route 84, which was originally designated from the state line at Muscatine, Iowa to Taylor Ridge. The route was first included on Illinois highway maps in 1924. It was marked on state maps as part of Route 84 in 1929 and briefly became part of Illinois Route 2 in 1938. In 1939, IL 92 replaced part of IL 2 between Muscatine, Iowa and Rock Island. Route 92 was realigned to the north in 1955, and Route 192 was designated on its former alignment from west of Edgington to U.S. Route 67. The route originally formed a concurrency with Route 94 from Route 192's present eastern terminus to US 67. Route 192 was shortened to its present length by 1999.
