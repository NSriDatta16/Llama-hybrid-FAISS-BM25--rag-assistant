Enter the Dru is the second studio album from American R&B group Dru Hill. Released on October 27, 1998, it was the group's second and final album for Island Black Music, the urban music division of Island Records; Island was merged with Def Jam Recordings following a company merger in December the same year, as Dru Hill would later be transferred to Def Jam's Def Soul subsidiary.

The album's title was inspired by the Bruce Lee 1973 film, Enter the Dragon.

This is the first album that the group were credited as executive producers as all four members wrote and produced several of the songs. It released three singles, "How Deep Is Your Love", "These Are The Times" and "You Are Everything". The singles all had music videos released, but the music video for "You Are Everything" was a remix video, which featured rapper Ja Rule, and Woody did not appear in it due to him leaving the group in early 1999. The remix version was later featured on lead singer Sisqó's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, which was released that November.

Recording sessions for the album took place at Larabee Studios in Los Angeles. The album peaked at number two on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. In May 1999, it was certified double-platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), after exceeding 2,000,000 copies in the United States.

Overview
The songs on the album are mainly performed by lead singer, Sisqó, who performs solo on four songs: "Real Freak", "How Deep Is Your Love", "This Is What We Do" and "One Good Reason". Jazz performs solo on "Holding You" and "I'll Be the One". Woody performs solo on "Angel". Nokio does not perform solo on any songs but he does get more lead vocals than on the group's eponymous debut album.

Background
The album was recorded over a three-week span at Larabee Studios in Los Angeles during the early months of 1998. Group member James "Woody Rock" Green would leave the group soon after the release of the album to pursue a career as a gospel musician. The other members also went on to do solo albums, which forced the group to go on hiatus.

Release and reception

The album peaked at number two on both the U.S. Billboard 200 and the R&B Albums chart. The album was certified gold in December 1998 and eventually recertified double-platinum by May 1999. Michael Gallucci of Allmusic gave the group and their second effort a favorable review, stating that "Dru Hill slice into the section of '90s soul music that crosses bedroom come-ons with classic street savvy (and nervy beats) without sounding at all whipped."
