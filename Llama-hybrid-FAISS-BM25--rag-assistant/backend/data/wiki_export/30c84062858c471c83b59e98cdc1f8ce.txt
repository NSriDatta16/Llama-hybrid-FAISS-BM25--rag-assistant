Nagarkhas (), also known as Oyum-Nagar, serves as the administrative center for the Nagar District in Gilgit–Baltistan and stands as one of the most largest towns within the district. Located along the Nagar River, this town also held the distinction of being the capital of the erstwhile princely state of Nagar.

Today, the renowned Karakoram Highway traverses through Nagar, establishing a crucial connection between  Pakistan and China via the Khunjerab Pass.  This roadway traces the course of the Hunza-Nagar River for a portion of its journey, passing through Nagar and extending into the Hunza District.

Location

Nagar is situated within the Nagar River valley, approximately five miles southeast of the junction where the Nagar River meets the Hunza River, and it's positioned just below Baltit.

The Nagar Valley, historically known as Broshal, is situated at an elevation of 2,688 meters (8,822 feet). Nagarkhas, the primary town, also served as the capital of the former princely state of Nagar. Within the Nagar District, the Ghulmet, Minapin, BAR, Chaprote, and Hopper Valleys are renowned tourist destinations due to their breathtaking landscapes. The district is home to some of the world's most imposing high mountain peaks, including Rakaposhi at 7,788 meters (25,561 feet), Diran, the Spantik (also referred to as the Golden Peak), and several others.
