Paranephrops planifrons or northern koura is a species of southern crawfish in the family Parastacidae. It is found in New Zealand. P. planifrons is one of two indigenous species of freshwater crayfish found in New Zealand. They are more commonly found in the North Island and the West Coast of the South Island while the P. zealandicus is found in the east and south of the South Island. Both species of Paranephrops are important resources to the indigenous Māori, particularly in the Te Arawa and Lake Taupō regions. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature's conservation status of P. planifrons is "LC", least concern, with no immediate threat to the species' survival.
