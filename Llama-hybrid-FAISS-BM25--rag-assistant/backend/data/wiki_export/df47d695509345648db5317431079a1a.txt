The Juno Awards of 2007 were hosted in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada on the weekend ending 1 April 2007. These ceremonies honoured music industry achievements in Canada during most of 2006. The event was well known for a possible tape delay by the CTV television network so the network could syndicate The Amazing Race.

Ceremonies
Most winners were announced at the Juno Gala Dinner and Awards ceremony on 31 March. This was a non-televised event conducted at TCU Place. At this event, Tom Jackson received the 2007 Humanitarian Award and Montreal-based music business veteran Donald K. Tarlton received the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award. Gregory Charles, a Quebec-based musician, hosted this gala.

The primary ceremonies of the major awards originated from the Credit Union Centre on 1 April and televised throughout Canada on CTV. Host Nelly Furtado was also the most successful artist this year, winning in five categories: Album of the Year, Artist of the Year, Juno Fan Choice Award, Pop Album of the Year and Single of the Year.

Winners in the following categories were announced during the primary ceremonies:

 Album of the Year
 Group of the Year
 Juno Fan Choice Award
 New Artist of the Year
 R&B/Soul Recording of the Year
 Rock Album of the Year
 Single of the Year

Telecast
CTV originally planned to provide a tape-delayed broadcast from 22:00 Eastern Daylight Time to accommodate an episode of the American version of The Amazing Race. However, the network relented due to opposition over the late timing, and scheduled the broadcast live from Ontario and eastward (19:00-21:00 Eastern) and tape delayed in western provinces (21:00-23:00 local time in British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 19:00-21:00 in Alberta). Quickly afterwards, the network made yet another change, allowing Saskatchewan viewers to watch the ceremony live (17:00 Central Standard) in addition to its previously scheduled timeslot.

National ratings for the Juno telecast were measured by BBM Nielsen at 912 000 viewers, an inferior result compared to the 966 000 viewers for Global's broadcast of The Simpsons or the 1.03 million viewers CBC gained from its airing of At Bertram's Hotel, an adaptation of the Agatha Christie mystery.
