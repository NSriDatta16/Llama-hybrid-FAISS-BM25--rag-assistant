The party joined The Olive Tree centre-left coalition led by Romano Prodi. In the 1996 Italian general election, RI  gave hospitality in its electoral lists to the Italian Socialists (SI), the Segni Pact (PS) and the Democratic Italian Movement (MID). The Dini List won 4.3% of the vote, winning 26 seats at the Chamber:

7 SI (Enrico Boselli, Giuseppe Albertini, Enzo Ceremigna, Giovanni Crema, Leone Delfino, Sergio Fumagalli, Roberto Villetti);
1 MID (Aldo Brancati).

The list also won 11 seats at the Senate:

4 Diniani (Mario D'Urso, Bianca Maria Fiorillo, Angelo Giorgianni, Adriano Ossicini);
