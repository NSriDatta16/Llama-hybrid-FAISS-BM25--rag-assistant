Richard George Green (born 19 February 1971) is an Australian professional golfer.

Early life
Green was born in Williamstown, Melbourne, Victoria.

Professional career
In 1992, Green turned professional and joined the PGA Tour of Australasia the same year. He has been a member of the European Tour since 1996, with his first win coming at the 1997 Dubai Desert Classic. His consistent performances in 2004 took him to a career best European Tour Order of Merit finish of 17th. That same year he won the MasterCard Masters and also topped the PGA Tour of Australasia's Order of Merit. In 2007 he won his second European Tour event at the BA-CA Golf Open in Austria.

Green previously held a share of the course record at Carnoustie with a 64, achieved in the final round of the 2007 Open Championship. (This record was later beaten by Tommy Fleetwood who shot a 63 at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in 2017.) The round saw him jump 27 places on the last day of the tournament to finish in a tie for 4th with Ernie Els.

Personal life
Green is also a keen motor racing fan and owns a Porsche 911 racing car in which he has competed in the Australian GT Championship on occasion as touring schedules allow, including racing on the support card of the 2009 Australian Grand Prix. Among the cars he has owned in the past (and has since sold) included the Bathurst 1000 winning Perkins Engineering Holden Commodore, Perkins Engineering Chassis 027.
