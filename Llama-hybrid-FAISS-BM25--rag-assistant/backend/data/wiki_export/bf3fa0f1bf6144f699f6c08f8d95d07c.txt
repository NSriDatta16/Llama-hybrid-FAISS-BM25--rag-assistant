As the game began, the temperature was 10 degrees Celsius, under sunny skies. However, after the sun went down, the temperatures plummeted.

Mark McLoughlin missed the opening field goal attempt, but Calgary opened the scoring with a single point.

The Ti-Cats ran the ball down the field, and Paul Osbaldiston kicked a 24-yard field goal to make the game 3-1. Minutes later, McLoughlin made up for his earlier failure with a 34 field goal to put the Stampeders ahead 4-3.

Kelvin Anderson ran in a 3-yard touchdown five minutes into the second quarter. The convert failed, and the Stamps led 10-3. Osbaldiston kicked in a Ti-Cats field goal from the 20-yard line to close the gap at 10-6. Hamilton got revenge with just over three minutes to go in the half, with a great reception by Ronald Williams. Osbaldiston nailed the convert and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats led 13-10. Osbaldiston finished out the half with his third field goal of the game to put the Ti-Cats up 16-10 going into half time.

In the second half, Osbaldiston managed a single off a 44-yard missed field goal. Four minutes later, Osbaldiston had another single on a 66-yard punt. On the final play of the third quarter, the Stamps capped a 14-play drive when Jeff Garcia ran in from the one for the touchdown to bring the Stampeders within one point of the Tiger-Cats with the score 18-17.

Aldi Henry intercepted a Danny McManus pass to give the Stamps possession at the 13:00 mark of the fourth quarter. The Stampeders were only able to convert a field goal out of the opportunity, but it was enough to give them the lead in the game again. McLoughlin kicked another field goal 5 minutes later to give the Stamps a 23-18 advantage. Archie Amerson made a terrific running play to take the ball to the two-yard line for the Ti-Cats. Williams ran in from the four, but the two point convert attempt failed, giving Hamilton a 24-23 lead with three minutes remaining.  After a Calgary drive, place kicker Mark McLoughlin kicked the field goal on the last play of the game to give Calgary the win.
