The Hunter × Hunter manga series, created by Yoshihiro Togashi, features an extensive cast of characters. It takes place in a fictional universe where licensed specialists known as Hunters travel the world taking on special jobs ranging from treasure hunting to assassination. The story initially focuses on Gon Freecss and his quest to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is himself a famous Hunter. On the way, Gon meets and becomes close friends with Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight.

Although most characters are human, most possess superhuman strength and/or supernatural abilities due to Nen, the ability to control one's own life energy or aura. The world of the series also includes fantastical beasts such as the Chimera Ants or the Five great calamities.

Protagonists

Gon Freecss

 is an athletic, naïve, and friendly boy. Having spent a lot of time in the woods as a child, he gets along very well with animals and has superhuman senses such as heightened sense of smell and sight, as well as very keen taste. Raised by Mito, Gon wants to become a Hunter in order to find his father, Ging, who is a Hunter as well. During the Hunter Exam Gon befriends Killua Zoldyck, Kurapika and Leorio Paradinight. After successfully becoming a licensed Hunter, Gon and Killua learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger. After becoming one of the first people to beat Greed Island, and helping to stop the Chimera Ants, Gon meets his father.. Following the meeting with his father, Gon decides to return to Whale Island and reunites with Mito .

Killua Zoldyck

 is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful and mischievous kid who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. His ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him — deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and overall pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial. Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger. He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island, helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the dying Gon. As Gon is about to meet Ging, Killua decides to part ways and travel the world with Alluka .

Conflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his new friends, as Killua puts them before himself without a single complaint. His greatest flaw is initially his fear of those seemingly more powerful than him, a result of Illumi's instructions to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he possesses extraordinary agility and strength as a one-man killing machine. Killua has mastered many killing techniques at a tender age and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which he utilizes by altering his aura into electricity.  His Hatsu involves various uses of electricity to increase his physical capabilities, such as , which allows him to move at immeasurable speeds. Killua is a popular character with fans, coming in first place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Kurapika

 is the sole survivor of the , a race with treasured irises that turn scarlet in times of anger or emotional turmoil. Four years before the series, the entire Kurta clan was eradicated by a criminal group known as the Phantom Troupe, who desecrated the Kurta's bodies by stealing their scarlet eyes, thereafter selling them on the black market. He participates in the Hunter Exam alongside Gon, Leorio and Killua in order to become a Blacklist Hunter and gain the resources to take vengeance for his people and retrieve their eyes. Despite his morals, Kurapika is not above adjoining himself to society's underworld — he aligns himself with the Nostrade mafia family as soon as the opportunity presents itself, and soon becomes head of Nostrade's bodyguards. Normally intelligent, quick-thinking and levelheaded, upon sight of a spider, the symbol of the Phantom Troupe, he becomes enraged. He kills Uvogin, causes Pakunoda's death, and seals Chrollo Lucilfer's Nen. He is later invited to join the Zodiacs as the "Rat" at Leorio's recommendation, and only accepts upon being told that Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou has the last batch of eyes that he needs to retrieve. This leads to his accompanying Woble Hui Guo Rou to the Dark Continent as her bodyguard.

Kurapika's Nen type is Conjuration. However, when his eyes turn scarlet, he becomes a Specialist. He conjures a unique weapon — five chains, extending from each finger on his right hand. His ring finger, , has a ball on the end used for dowsing and normal defensive and offensive purposes. Kurapika entered into a Nen contract for the chain on his middle finger, ; in order to have an unbreakable chain that will fully incapacitate members of the Phantom Troupe, he offered his life should he use it on anyone other than its members. His thumb chain, , heals any injury with the crucifix on the end. His little finger, , stabs an enemy's heart, allowing Kurapika to issue a command, which kills the enemy if not followed. His index finger, , uses the syringe on the end to extract someone's aura and Nen ability. His specialist ability, , allows him to utilize 100% of all types of Nen but shortens his lifespan by one hour every second he uses it. When he uses his index finger with Emperor Time activated, it turns into , a dolphin-like figure only he can see that allows him to use the stolen ability, informing him on its basic details, and grant the stolen ability to someone else (who then sees Stealth Dolphin as well) for a single use. Kurapika was inspired by the Ohmu in Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Kurapika is a popular character with fans, coming in second place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Leorio Paradinight

 is a teen that looks like a young adult who befriends Gon, Kurapika and Killua during the Hunter Exam. After losing a friend to a curable illness he could not afford the treatment for, Leorio decides to become a Hunter, seeking the large financial gains of the profession to become a doctor and treat the impoverished for free. Though he is often outshone by the genius combat abilities of Gon and Killua, Leorio is rather talented. After becoming a licensed Hunter, Leorio assists his friends in their encounter with the Phantom Troupe from the sidelines. He resurfaces while Gon is hospitalized and enters the running to become the next Chairman of the Hunter Association, finishing in second place. Leorio is later invited to become a member of the Zodiacs as the "Boar" and joins their expedition to the Dark Continent. When the Black Whale finally sets sail, Leorio starts working at the medical facility on the third deck under Cheadle Yorkshire. Killua suspects that Leorio's Nen type is Emission after seeing him teleport a punch across a room with a wormhole. Leorio is a popular character with fans, coming in fifth and sixth place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Antagonists

Hisoka Morow

 is a magician and serial killer who combines magic tricks with violence, and delights in battling those he considers strong to the point of sexual arousal. He is deceitful, playful, and narcissistic by nature, acting only in his own self-interest. In the manga, his sentences typically end with a suit symbol. Hisoka takes an interest in Gon and his friends after encountering them during the Hunter Exam, letting them live so that they grow into more worthy opponents. Although he is initially positioned as an antagonist due to his affinity towards murder, he occasionally acts as a comrade to Gon, when it suits his own interests. Hisoka is revealed to be member number four of the Phantom Troupe, although he only joined for a chance to fight their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer. He leaves the group when Chrollo's Nen is sealed by Kurapika and sets out to find a way to break the seal. Having succeeding in this task, Hisoka dies after fighting Chrollo in Heavens Arena, but revives himself, and goes on a killing rampage against the Phantom Troupe. Hisoka is currently believed to be on board the Black Whale, where he is being hunted by the Phantom Troupe and the Xi-Yu and Cha-R mafia families.

Hisoka's Nen type is Transmutation, allowing him to change the type or properties of his aura. He most often uses , which gives his aura the properties of both rubber and gum. He also uses , which allows him to reproduce the texture of his choice on any flat surface; such as making a handkerchief appear to be skin. Hisoka is a popular character with fans, coming in fourth and fifth place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Phantom Troupe
The , also known as the , is a gang of thieves with a 13 membership ever-changing roster. New entrants to the organization are chosen by their leader Chrollo, and those who kill a member may take their place. Each member bears a numbered tattoo of a 12-legged spider. Chrollo and the founding members of the Phantom Troupe originated in the slum , the residents of which do not exist in any official records, an ideal recruiting ground for criminal organizations. Although they mainly steal and kill, they occasionally do philanthropic work. Currently, after he murdered two of their members following his defeat by Chrollo, the Phantom Troupe are on board the Black Whale hunting down Hisoka for revenge.

Chrollo Lucilfer

 is the founder and leader of the Phantom Troupe, bearing the number 0, and is considered by its members as irreplaceable despite putting the Troupe before himself. Surprisingly, Chrollo is right in the middle in terms of the Troupe's physical strength, at seventh place. Chrollo led the genocide of the Kurta Clan, which resulted in its sole survivor Kurapika vowing to punish all of the Spiders. After meeting in Yorknew City, Chrollo is afflicted by Kurapika's ability which forbids the use of his own Nen as well as any contact with his subordinates. Some time later, Hisoka acquires an exorcist to remove Kurapika's seal in order to finally challenge Chrollo to a fight. Chrollo wins the match and seemingly kills him. After Hisoka reveals himself to still be alive and begins killing off members of the Troupe, he and the rest of the Spiders board the Black Whale. His Nen type is Specialization and his ability  allows him to directly steal and use the abilities of other Nen users, which he stores in a Conjured book. Chrollo came in fourth place in the series' second popularity poll.

Bonolenov Ndongo

During the Chimera Ant arc, he fights with the other members of the Phantom Troupe against the Chimera Ants. His physical power ranks eighth among the Troupe. Bonolenov is a descendant of the , a small wild tribe that was chased out of their lands by development. When males of the Gyudondond tribe reach the age of three, they are circumcised and needles are inserted in various parts of their body. Over time, these needles are replaced with thicker sticks, and the holes are stabilized with bamboo stalks or stones. Using these holes, Gyudondond males are able to create a variety of sounds through air flow. They are called , the dancing warriors, and fulfill the role of shamans and performers in their tribe. Before combat, they use their bodies to play songs of battle. The Gyudondond believe that the more beautiful a sound that is played, the greater the spirit it can summon. Bonolenov uses the various songs he makes as a medium to materialize different effects (from an armor and spear to a scaled-down planet Jupiter) through his Conjuration Nen ability, titled .

Feitan Portor

 is one of the original members hailing from Meteor City and bears the number 2 in the Troupe. He's physically the fifth strongest member in Troupe. He is attired in what one would expect from a bandit—dark clothes partnered with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth. He seldom speaks, but when he does, it is full of grammatical errors, giving the impression that he is not speaking in his native tongue. During the Phantom Troupe's fight with Chimera Ants, Feitan reverts to his native language, shown with Chinese characters. After Feitan's victory over Zazan in Meteor City, he is crowned temporary leader of the Phantom Troupe. Feitan's movements are incredibly fast, being able to leave afterimages of his body. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun. He later appears on the Black Whale with Phinks, Franklin, and Nobunaga.

His Nen type is Transmutation. His ability  transforms the injuries he has received from his enemy into an attack. The more pain he receives, the stronger his attack. Currently, only  has been revealed, a miniature sun that burns anyone around him, even allies, as shown by the rest of the Phantom Troupe fleeing the scene when he uses it. Only Feitan is unaffected by the attack, presumably because of the armor that is formed on him. Feitan came in tenth place in the series' second popularity poll.

Franklin Bordeau

 is very large, with multiple facial scars similar to that of Frankenstein's monster, and bears the number 7. He ranks fourth in physical power among the Troupe and is among the original members hailing from Meteor City. Franklin, along with the rest of the Phantom Troupe, is aboard the Black Whale. Franklin's Nen type is Emission. His ability is called  and allows him to shoot countless bullets composed of Nen from his fingertips, which he modified into guns himself.

Kortopi

 is short in stature with a thick and messy mane of hair covering his entire head, obscuring everything except for an occasional glimpse of his left eyeball. He is the weakest in the Troupe in raw physical power. In fact, his Conjuration Nen abilities suggest that he is not involved in combat, but rather theft and subterfuge. His Nen ability is called , which allows him to make perfect copies of any object by touching it with his left hand and producing the copy with his right. He can make copies of living humans, but they will be immobile and lifeless. The copies vanish after 24 hours have passed. He is also able to know the exact location of any copy he has created by touching the original object. Kortopi is the first of the Phantom Troupe members killed by Hisoka after his defeat to Chrollo.

Machi Komacine

 is incredibly loyal to Chrollo and is one of the original members from Meteor City, bearing the number 3. Physically, she is the strongest woman in the Troupe and the sixth strongest overall. Hisoka seems to have an occasional interest in her. She has an extremely keen intuition (the other members claim that she has never been wrong). Machi's Nen type is Transmutation. Her ability  forms her aura into thread, the strength of which is inversely proportional to its length: a thread as long as the diameter of the Earth would be as strong as cotton, but a one millimeter-long thread can lift a ton. It can be used to track people, and also to stitch severed limbs back on. Machi came in seventh place in the series' second popularity poll.

Nobunaga Hazama

 has a similar appearance to ronin warriors in Edo period Japan, complete with a long katana that he uses with great finesse and skill, and bears the number 1 in the Troupe. Nobunaga specializes in combining nen with the use of his katana. His best friend is Uvogin, and the two bring out the best of each other in combat. Seeing some of Uvogin's personality in Gon, he expresses interest in having Gon join the Troupe, though Gon adamantly refuses. Nobunaga ranks ninth in physical power among the Troupe, and is one of the original members. Nobunaga is on the Black Whale with the rest of the Troupe, hunting for treasure and Hisoka. He, along with Feitan, Phinks, and Franklin, thrash three unruly passengers to gain seating in the cafeteria. Once the thugs submit to them, he asks them how they can get to the second floor. His Nen type is Enhancement. Nobunaga came in 14th place in the series' second popularity poll.

Pakunoda

 is an original member of the Phantom Troupe from Meteor City. She is fully loyal to Chrollo, even going against the Troupe in order to help him. She is killed by Kurapika's Judgement Chain in the climax of the Phantom Troupe arc by purposefully violating the restrictions placed upon her. Her body is buried in the Troupe's Yorknew hideout. Pakunoda's Nen type is Specialization. Her main ability is to read the memories of people she touches by asking specific questions, a form of Psychometry. Her secondary ability, , allows her to conjure these memories into the shape of a bullet which she fires into people's heads, thereby giving them that information. She is 11th in physical strength.

Phinks Magcub

 uses his hands in battle, which has been shown to be extremely powerful. He is one of the original Phantom Troupe members from Meteor City, wears an Egyptian Pharaoh-like outfit in battle and bears the number 5. Phinks seems to get along best with Feitan, and is almost always seen partnered with him both in and out of combat. As with the rest of the Phantom Troupe, Phinks boards the Black Whale. Phinks, along with Feitan, Franklin, and Nobunaga, confront and thrash three unruly passengers. His Nen ability is called , the strength of which is dependent upon how many times he rotates his arm; the more rotations, the more powerful his attack will be. In terms of physical strength, Phinks is ranked second among the Troupe members. Nen type: Enhancement.

Shalnark

 is member number 6 of the Phantom Troupe, and from his appearance, seems to be a normal man. However, he is one of the most intelligent and quick-thinking members in the group, being highly adept at using computers and information gathering. Shalnark is also a licensed Hunter, so he has access to potentially useful information for the Phantom Troupe. He ranks tenth in physical power. Shalnark is the second member killed by Hisoka after he decides to wipe out the Phantom Troupe following his defeat by Chrollo. Shalnark's Nen type is Manipulation.

His main ability, , allows him to completely control the actions of others remotely using his cell phone after sticking a specialized antenna into their bodies. His secondary ability involves applying the antenna upon himself and putting his body on autopilot, resulting in an enhanced state with enough power to devastate most opponents. However, he dislikes this ability because he is subject to immense muscle pain for days after its use, and, as he retains no memory or control over what transpires, he can not derive any pleasure or satisfaction when he uses it to win a fight. Shalnark came in 17th place in the series' second popularity poll.

Shizuku Murasaki

 is extremely forgetful, even an airhead at times, which, along with her quiet appearance, causes opponents to underestimate her abilities.

Uvogin

 is one of the original members of the Troupe from Meteor City. Out of all, he is the strongest in terms of raw physical power. Direct hits from bullets, sniper rounds, and even anti-tank rockets do not cause visible damage to him. Like all of the Troupe, he never hesitates to kill, and particularly enjoys combat against skilled opponents. Although he prefers to fight alone, Uvogin is stronger when fighting with a partner, usually Nobunaga, as he fights better when there is someone else to protect (although he never admits this). Seeking revenge on Kurapika for capturing him after his battle with the Shadow Beasts, Uvogin tracks him to the hotel where Neon Nostrade and the rest of her bodyguards are staying. They fight one-on-one in a small canyon on the outskirts of Yorknew City. Kurapika eventually captures Uvogin with his Chain Jail, and questions him about the location and abilities of the other Phantom Troupe members. Uvogin refuses to answer any questions. Kurapika pierces Uvogin's chest with his Judgement Chain ability, giving the condition to answer all questions truthfully, in a last-ditch attempt to threaten him. Uvogin refuses for the final time, and is instantly killed, with his body buried by Kurapika soon after. He is the 11th member of the Troupe and his Nen type is Enhancement. His Nen ability is  which allows him to focus his aura into his fist, causing a massive explosion upon impact. Uvogin came in 12th place in the series' second popularity poll.

Illumi Zoldyck

 is Killua's eldest brother, an experienced and expert assassin who played a part in Killua's training and upbringing. He and his father raised Killua to thrive on killing and to be incapable of friendship, although Illumi planted a needle in Killua's brain to compel him to flee from unwinnable fights as his way of protecting him. During the 287th Hunter Exam, using special pins to change his facial structure, disguising himself as , Illumi became a licensed Hunter and possibly manipulated Killua into disqualifying himself. After learning of and removing Illumi's needle from his brain, Killua later acts against his brother when he attempts to kill their sibling Alluka for the good of their family. Illumi also has a complex friendship with Hisoka, being hired by him to join the Phantom Troupe as their number 11 and kill him.

He then rejoins Sub and Bara to continue collecting the rest of the specified slot cards in order to win the game. However, he is challenged and defeated by Gon in a one-on-one match (while Killua and Biscuit draw away his teammates and defeat them separately). Genthru is also able to create detonations in his hands when he grabs something using .

Chimera Ants
 are an invasive species of insect that originate from the Dark Continent, extremely dangerous and ranked as quarantined due to their voracious appetites. Chimera Ant queens possess an entirely unique method of reproduction known as : reproducing asexually while imbuing her offspring with the genetic traits of whatever she ate. To take advantage of the genes of a particular species, a Chimera Ant queen has been known to feed until the fodder species is driven to extinction. One mutated Chimera Ant Queen in particular targets humans, leading to the creation of humanoid Chimera Ants who desire individualism and develop the ability to use Nen. These human Chimera Ants also possess the genetic memories of their "past lives", some only having trace memories while others are their original selves reborn. Following the death of the Queen, the colony disburses with a majority following the King Meruem while others attempt to create their own colonies. Only a few of the humanoid Chimera Ants survive and are allowed to live among humans, classified as a new species of magical beast.

Chimera Ant Queen

The Chimera Ant  is the first Chimera Ant to be seen in the series, having mysteriously mutated to about two meters tall instead of her kind's typical height of ten centimeters. She first appears having washed up injured on the shores of the autonomous region of Neo-Green Life (or simply NGL), a small insular nation located on an island known as the Mitene Union. Driven by her reproductive instincts to give birth to a Chimera Ant King with ideal traits, the Queen immediately begins to feed on small mammals and aquatic life in order to give birth to soldier ants to bring her larger prey in greater amounts. When one brings her two-human children to feed on, she notes them to be more nourishing than her previous prey and becomes obsessed with human as nourishment, sending her soldiers to concentrate on gathering more humans to feed on. NGL's status as neo-Luddite enables the Queen's offspring to be unopposed before their activities are eventually learned by the outside world. The Queen is fatally injured when the Chimera Ant King forces his own premature birth, damaging her organs with massive blood loss. Despite receiving treatment from Hunters, she dies while naming her son as Meruem. But upon her death, the Queen is revealed to have birthed a twin sister to Meruem, who is later revealed to be Kite reborn as a Chimera Ant.

Meruem

 is the Chimera Ant  and the most powerful of the Queen's offspring. Forcing himself out the womb at the cost of the Queen's life, Meruem is arrogant with little sense of identity aside from his supposed destiny and preconceived notions of his kind's superiority over humans. Meruem leaves the N.G.L. with his Royal Guards in search of a place to establish his colony, taking over the Republic of East Gorteau. Pitou manipulates the corpse of East Gorteau's dictator Ming Jol-ik to order a mandatory gathering of the entire population for a national rally, so they can secretly sort to find Nen users who will be used as food. They also use Pitou's ability to manipulate the people, forming an army of soldiers under their control. The Hunter Association mobilizes an extermination team to infiltrate the East Gorteau palace and assassinate Meruem, composed of a selected team of professional Hunters.

Meruem takes an interest in strategy games, defeating champion-level players by learning their battle tactics after disrupting the flow of their playing style. However, he is unable to overcome the skill of a seemingly dimwitted blind girl named Komugi in Gungi, the local game she reigns over. As Meruem finds himself unable to beat her, he begins showing respect and care for Komugi while questioning his own violent methods of ruling. As such, the King wavers between his human emotions and animal instincts, ultimately deciding to compromise by taking over the planet for the Chimera Ants, but sparing humans and leaving them to live in reservations. Meruem's faltering leaves him vulnerable, experiencing fear for the first time when Netero detonates the bomb in his body as a last resort. Near death, Meruem survives and regenerates by feeding on the cells of Pouf and Youpi, acquiring their abilities as well. The King suffers temporary memory loss before recovering his memories of Komugi. But Netero's suicide attack ultimately takes Meruem's life due to the bomb's residual poison, spending his final moments playing with Komugi before dying in her arms. Meruem's Nen ability, , allows him to take in the aura of other creatures he consume, making him stronger in the process.

Royal Guards
The Royal Guards are a trio of elite Chimera Ants whose objective is protecting Ants of the royal caste. They originally serve the Queen, who personally named them, until the King is born, after which they switch loyalties and follow him to the Republic of East Gorteau. The Royal Guards include Neferpitou, Shaiapouf, and Menthuthuyoupi.

Neferpitou

, also known as , is a cat-humanoid Chimera Ant and the firstborn of the Royal Guards. Pitou is one of the first Chimera Ants to fully utilize Nen with enough skill to be recognized by even Netero as a superior combatant. Pitou shows a knack for medical/surgical procedures, prodding and manipulating Pokkle's brain in order to have the human divulge everything he knows about Nen to the Ants. As a Specialist-type Nen user, Pitou's ability  heals injuries, while  can manipulate bodies regardless if they are alive or dead. Pitou is referred to in the manga using male pronouns, while the anime elects to use gender-neutral pronouns as well as male pronouns.

After being born, Pitou engaged Kite when he, Gon, and Killua almost reached the nest. Pitou killed Kite after he had Killua and Gon escape, reanimating his corpse as a training dummy for the other chimera ants before the Hunters acquired it. Later confronted by Gon and deeming him a potential threat to Meruem, Pitou exploits the boy's hopes that Kite was still alive to get him away from Komugi to kill him without endangering the girl. But upon revealing Kite's fate, Pitou's head is completely destroyed when Gon forcibly aged himself at the cost of his ability to use Nen. But Pitou's corpse is briefly reanimated by a more potent Terpsichora for the purpose of killing Gon, severing the boy's arm before being damaged beyond repair.

Shaiapouf

, also known as , is a butterfly-humanoid Chimera Ant and one of the Royal Guards. He is the most cunning of the three, though his temperament and love for Meruem causes him to covertly defy the King's orders in order to prevent his humanization. Having wholeheartedly devoted himself to protect Meruem while seeing humans as inferior, Pouf is grossly disturbed by the King's obsession with Komugi whom he views as a threat to their plans to the point of making attempts on the girl's life. Pouf's Nen ability  spreads scales from his wings into the air allowing him to read opponents' psychological states. When inhaled the scales have a hypnotic effect on the human populace, keeping them in place to be sorted at the palace. His other ability  allows Pouf to break up his body into clones of various sizes down to nanosize. Following the blast from Netero's bomb, Pouf runs to Meruem and allows him to feed on his own cells to save the King's life. Pouf dies from the poison he was exposed to at ground zero of the bomb.

Menthuthuyoupi

, also known as , is the third of the Chimera Ant Royal Guards. Youpi is the largest of the three and the only non-human hybrid among them, mixed with the genes of a magical beast instead. He is the most straightforward of the Royal Guards and possesses a strength that comes from complete selflessness and devotion to the King. Youpi's body can metamorphosize, such as forming wings to fly or additional arms for combat. After feeling extreme mental stress, he learns his Nen ability can billow large quantities of his aura into his body and release it in a destructive explosion. Through his fights with the Hunters, Youpi comes to respect them and Nen to the point of letting them live. Following the blast from Netero's bomb, Youpi runs to Meruem and allows him to feed on his own cells to save the King's life. Youpi dies from the poison he was exposed to at ground zero of the bomb.

Hunter Association
The  is a non-governmental organization responsible for the testing and licensing of —a person that has proven themselves through rigorous examination to be an elite member of humanity and who specializes in finding rare creatures, secret treasures, and other individuals.

This results in massive registration numbers for the annual licensing exam with an extremely high failure rate.

Isaac Netero

 is the Chairman of the Selection Committee for the Hunter Exam. Presiding over it, he has final authority over every stage of the examination and is assisted by his secretary , who helps organize the Hunter Exam and presents the successful candidates with their license.

Ging claims that he does not want to see Gon because he is too ashamed of himself for being absent in Gon's life due to his own selfishness, and challenges his son to find him. Despite that he seems confident in Gon's abilities and knows him better than anyone; he knew Gon would become a Hunter and left a memory card for Greed Island and a recorded message with Mito to give to him once he did, and knew Gon would eventually recover from his hospitalization. All information about Ging is classified even in the official Hunter database. He is Kite's teacher and also inspired Satotz to become a Hunter.

Examiners
The Hunter Exam is divided into several stages, each one overseen by an experienced hunter. In the first shown exam in the series, the first examiner is , who tests the candidates' stamina by leading them on a marathon of unknown length through a tunnel and a swampland filled with uniquely dangerous creatures. The second stage of the exam is administered by two Gourmet Hunters,  and . Although Menchi fails all of the candidates due to her stubbornness, Netero pressures her into giving the candidates an alternative test. The third stage is overseen by Bounty Hunter and prison warden , testing the candidates in different aspects of group dynamics, both in a communal and individual front. Chairman Netero organizes the final stage as a one-on-one fighting tournament, where the winner must get his opponent to admit defeat. In a twist, contestants pass the exam after winning only one fight with the loser advancing to the next round, meaning only one examinee will fail. Satotz came in seventh and 22nd place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Examinees
The examinees that took part in the 287th annual Hunter Exam, the year the series' main characters took the exam.

Hanzo

 is an 18-year-old shinobi who has trained in the art of ninjutsu since he was born. He decided to become a Hunter in order to find the elusive Hermit's Scroll. In the second test of the exam, featuring cooking, he is the only one to know what sushi is, as it is a dish from his home country, Japan. In the final test of the Hunter Exam, Hanzo is put against Gon in a fight where one of them must admit defeat. Despite his speed, strength, and battle experience easily exceeding that of Gon, Gon refuses even after Hanzo breaks his arm. Noting the lack of hate in Gon's eyes after this act, Hanzo realizes he actually has come to like him. He willingly bows out of the battle, giving Gon the victory needed for him to pass the exam. Hanzo wins and passes the exam himself when he threatens the same to Pokkle in his next match, becoming a licensed Hunter. It is later stated by Wing that Hanzo learned Nen after the Hunter Exam. Hanzo later reappears in the Dark Continent arc as part of Kurapika's party and becomes a bodyguard of prince Momoze. Ordered by her mother to protect Marayam instead of Momoze, a furious Hanzo blames himself when Momoze is killed and vows to make the murderer pay. Hanzo came in eighth and 16th place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Tonpa

 is nicknamed the "Rookie Crusher" by candidates with more experience taking the exam. He has taken the exam for 35 consecutive terms, never managing to pass. He often brags of his experience to those taking the exam for the first time and offers them a helping hand. This is merely subterfuge, as he takes a perverse pleasure in sabotaging their attempts to get the license. This time around, he trails Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio while attempting various means to foil their advancement. In order to do this, he uses methods like spiking drinks with a strong laxative and being contradictory simply to delay progress in a time-sensitive arena. He also attends the following Hunter Exam, where he, along with everyone else, is defeated by Killua.

Pokkle

 is an accomplished archer that carries a bow and quiver of arrows wherever he goes. The arrows are tipped with a potent tranquilizer that, even with a small nick, induces paralysis for any person for up to a week. Pokkle's aim is to become a successful hunter of undocumented fantastic beasts. He passes the exam and becomes a licensed Hunter. Pokkle is then seen in N.G.L. with Ponzu and several others before their group is attacked by Chimera Ants. Pokkle is poisoned by Zazan and brought to the colony to be fed to the Queen, but, using a hidden antidote, is able to restore some movement and hide before the Chimera Ants start searching for him for his knowledge on Nen. However, the newly born Neferpitou senses Pokkle hiding and he is subjected to his brain being prodded by the Royal Guard to divulge everything he knows about Nen before being killed. Pokkle's Nen ability, , creates a bow in his left hand and an arrow in his right; red arrows burst into flames on contact and orange are his fastest. Pokkle came in 12th and 18th place in the series' first two popularity polls.

Ponzu

 is one of the 24 that managed to enter the fourth stage of the Hunter Exam. She fights using chemical weapons, a wide variety of toxins, and prefers to set traps instead of fighting head on. Her secret weapon lies within her round cap, carrying neurotoxic bees under the surface that emerge and attack her enemies when she is threatened. During this stage, her bees instinctively end up killing Bourbon after she falls into his trap. Ponzu is rescued by Gon, but her badge is taken when she is unconscious so Leorio can pass, causing her to fail the exam. She also attends the following Hunter Exam, where she, along with everyone else, is defeated by Killua. Ponzu is then seen in N.G.L. with Pokkle and several others before their group is attacked by Chimera Ants. The group is killed by Zazan's squad, but she escapes long enough to send one of her bees with a message to the strongest Hunter nearby, who happens to be Kite. She is shot and eaten moments later by a gun-wielding Chimera Ant. Ponzu came in ninth place in the series' first popularity poll.

Chimera Ant Exterminators
With the infestation of man-sized Chimera Ants within N.G.L., the Hunter Association sends an official team to investigate and contain the threat. The extermination team is led by none other than Chairman Netero himself. Netero handpicks those who are to accompany him, causing significant political bickering within the Hunter Association.

Morel Mackernasey

 is a Hunter and member of the team tasked with exterminating the Chimera Ants. A tough yet very compassionate man with long hair and sunglasses, he is Knuckle Bine and Shoot McMahon's master, and acknowledged by Netero to be about equal to himself. He uses a giant smoking pipe and the smoke produced by it as his weapons. With his Nen ability , Morel creates smoke puppets that act independently from him once commands are issued. Morel shows himself as an experienced and resourceful fighter, such as in his fight against Leol wherein he uses his pipe as a snorkel to allow himself to breathe underwater, and in doing so suffocates his opponent with emitted carbon dioxide. After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, Morel is expected to be promoted to Triple Star Hunter.

Knov

 is a Hunter and member of the team tasked with exterminating the Chimera Ants. An intelligent man dressed in glasses and a suit, he is Palm's master and a target of her affections, and acknowledged by Netero to be about equal to himself. Knov's Nen ability  is similar to teleportation in that he creates portals to a Nen dimension. Inside this four-floor Nen mansion, he can store items or people. While others can only exit from a predetermined place, Knov can use his master key to exit from any previously set portal he wants. While infiltrating Meruem's palace solo in order to place portals, Knov sees Shaiapouf's aura, which frightens him so much that he suffers a severe nervous breakdown. When he later returns to save the injured during the attack, his black hair has turned white from the psychological trauma.

Knuckle Bine

 is a Beast Hunter and Morel's pupil. Despite appearing to be an aggressive man, Knuckle is very compassionate and easily moved to tears. He also gets along well with animals, having the habit of taking care of abandoned pets. Knuckle's Nen ability is , where by lending some aura to his opponent via a punch, he attaches a small indestructible Nen-creature called  or A.P.R. for short. It follows the opponent wherever they go and grows each successive time Knuckle hits them and by 10% interest on the borrowed aura every ten seconds. The opponent pays Knuckle back by hitting him, but he will not take damage until the debt is fully paid, and if the aura count exceeds their total remaining aura, the opponent goes bankrupt. At this point A.P.R. transforms into  or I.R.S. for short, which attaches itself and forces the debtor into Zetsu unable to use Nen for 30 days. A drawback is that A.P.R. can only be activated on a single person at a time.

Shoot McMahon

 is an Unidentified Beast Hunter with one arm and Morel's pupil. Shoot's Nen ability is  and involves manipulating a cage and three disembodied hands that levitate. Shoot can shrink and seal off what is hit by his hands, in the cage. He has a timid personality and is often afraid of taking advantage of opportune times to attack his enemy. In the fight against Youpi during the extermination team's raid on East Gorteau, Shoot becomes inspired by Gon, and by facing adversity is able to overcome his timidness and fight without concern for his life.

Palm Siberia

 is the pupil of Knov, for whom she has affections. In order for her to accompany Knov on the extermination, Gon and Killua must defeat Knuckle and Shoot within one month, so Palm contacts Biscuit to train them further. On most occasions, she appears disheveled and stressed, exuding a frightening aura. However, she is depicted as quite beautiful when dressed up. She develops a crush on Gon, but is unable to further their relationship. Palm can see the location of anyone she has seen with her own eyes by using a small mermaid crystal ball relic fed by her blood. Palm is sent into the Chimera Ant King's palace undercover as a secretary to Director Bizeff, the man who actually ran East Gorteau behind the scenes, in order to lay eyes on the King and Royal Guards and track them. She is captured and transformed into a Chimera Ant-hybrid, with the Nen ability  creating defensive outfits from her hair wrapping over her body. Killua manages to help Palm regain her memories and return to the side of the Hunters. Palm's clairvoyant ability reformed into , which enables her to see the last three people seen by her right eye in the crystal ball on her forehead when she covers that same eye.

Others

Kite

 is the very first Hunter introduced in the story. A student of Ging Freecss, Gon's father, he traveled to Whale Island three years prior to the start of the series looking for leads in order to pass his final test, find Ging.

After completing Greed Island Gon runs into Kite again, who, after finding Ging, is in the middle of a biological survey searching for new species in the country of Kakin. He is leading a team of young would-be Hunters named Banana Kavaro, Lin Koshi, Monta Yuras, Podungo Lapoy, Spinner Clow, and Stick Dinner. His Nen ability is  where a clown-head randomly chooses a number from 1 to 9 and summons respective weapons, which he can not put away until he uses.

Kite is killed by Neferpitou and his body rebuilt into a manipulated puppet to train the Chimera Ants. He is captured by Knuckle and Shoot, with Gon vowing to save him and get revenge. It is later revealed that Meruem's twin sister found on the Queen's corpse is Kite reborn as a female Chimera Ant. Ging claims that Crazy Slots has a number that only comes up when Kite "really doesn't want to die" and suspects this is the reason he is "alive". While named Reina by Colt, Kite quickly matured while regaining the memories and personality of her former human male self and helps snap Gon out of his depression. Kite also forces , the koala-humanoid Chimera Ant hitman, to become her subordinate as penitence for the death of a girl whose physical appearance Kite has assumed as a Chimera Ant. Kite came in tenth place in the series' first popularity poll.

Melody

As Leorio notes, she is one of the very few characters who have made Kurapika open up to them. Melody's physical appearance is in sharp contrast to her kind soul. Due to effects of the "Sonata of Darkness", a musical piece said to have been written by Satan himself, casting on whoever listens to it a great curse, her body is short and her right arm disfigured. One night, Melody and her friend were drunk, and her friend played the Sonata. Its power was so great, that upon hearing only the first movement of the flute solo, Melody was disfigured. Her friend was not so lucky; his entire body was disfigured like Melody's arm and he died after playing it. Melody gained her Nen abilities in exchange. Melody's goal is to find the Sonata of Darkness and destroy it. Melody has the ability to Emit her aura to people to soothe fatigue when she plays an instrument. Melody also has a very sharp sense of hearing and can tell a person's psychological state just by listening to their heartbeat. For example, she knows when people are lying or when someone has completely lost his/her temper. Melody reappears in the Dark Continent arc as part of Kurapika's party, becoming a bodyguard of prince Kacho. Melody was inspired by Nausicaä and Yupa in Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, or possibly Ashitaka from Princess Mononoke instead of Yupa. Melody came in 20th place in the series' second popularity poll.

Basho

 is one of Neon Nostrade's new bodyguards, hired along with Kurapika.

Zeno came in ninth place in the series' second popularity poll.

Silva Zoldyck

 is Killua's father. A silent, pensive figure, Killua's interaction with him seems limited. He allows Killua to go along with Gon on their journey to find his father, but only because he sees it as a crucial step in his development as the head assassin of the Zoldyck Family. During the auction in Yorknew City, Silva and Zeno are both hired by the Ten Dons to assassinate the Phantom Troupe, but withdraw from the job when their clients are killed due to a job taken by Illumi, Maha, and Kalluto. This was Silva's second time fighting Chrollo Lucilfer, and according to Killua, he previously killed an unknown member of the Phantom Troupe.

He seems to be a sort of otaku, since his room is covered with figurines from various anime, manga and video games. Milluki is talented in hacking computer systems, as Killua asks him to hack a memory card from Ging. He was also injured during Killua's escape. Milluki is in charge of torturing Killua as punishment, but does not have the drive to carry it out very long as he becomes physically exhausted. After being tipped off by Killua on the whereabouts of a Greed Island cartridge, Milluki's excitement results in one of the rarer moments in which he makes an outside expedition in search of the game, he himself states that he had not left the mansion in eight years. However, he is unable to win a copy and leaves in frustration.

Alluka Zoldyck

 is the second youngest sibling of Killua. While the other members of the Zoldyck family refer to Alluka as male or as an object, Killua, who is the closest to Alluka, states that Alluka is female. Alluka is a dark child with the ability to grant wishes and a second personality, named  by Killua. Once a person grants three requests made by Alluka, Nanika grants their wish. The bigger the wish, the bigger Alluka's demands will be for the next person. If four of Alluka's demands are refused in a row, at least two people, the refusee and their closest friend/love, will die. A larger wish requires more deaths in the next round when the demands are refused; dying in the order of the amount of time they have spent with the refusee. Once people die in refusal, the demands "reset" to the lowest difficulty level. Because Alluka's power is considered too dangerous, Alluka is locked up alone in a room full of toys. Fearing that Killua will ask Alluka's help to save Gon's life, Illumi asks for Hisoka's help in searching for and killing Alluka, as Alluka poses a grave danger to the entire Zoldyck family in the case of Killua getting killed by Alluka's power. Killua eventually has Alluka cure Gon without consequence, as he can make demands of Nanika without paying a price. After Gon is healed, Killua demands Nanika not grant anyone else's wishes and starts traveling together with Alluka. The caption to a standalone illustration of Alluka in Volume 33 of Hunter × Hunter reads "Ai. I'm from the Dark Continent", possibly suggesting that Alluka's power is due to the Gaseous Life-form:  that humans brought back from the Dark Continent.

Maha Zoldyck

Only 100 copies were made that sold for 5.8 billion jenny (the currency of Hunter × Hunter), the highest ever for a video game. The game seemingly transports its players' physical bodies into "the world" of Greed Island (though it is actually an isolated island that exists in the real world), only releasing them when they die (at which point they die in real life too), when they win, or when they use a special card in the game that lets them out.

Biscuit Krueger

 is a Double Star Stone Hunter who Gon and Killua team up with in Greed Island. Although she appears to be a little girl, her true form is actually that of a massive and extremely muscular 57-year-old woman several times the size.

Her goal in Greed Island is to obtain a gem found only in the game, Blue Planet. She becomes Gon and Killua's second teacher, and is also the teacher of Wing, the man who first teaches Nen to Gon and Killua.

He and his team later engage Genthru's in a game of chase in order to buy time for Gon to train against Genthru and for Killua to heal his injuries.

Nickes

 is a Greed Island player and the leader of his own group consisting of numerous other players including Abengane and Genthru, which they will attempt to work together in beating the game.

Razor

 is one of the Game Masters and a creator of Greed Island. Razor was told by Gon's father not to hold back against his son should he ever come to Greed Island. Razor is a key person in getting one of the hardest cards in the game; the challengers must confront Razor and his 14 devils in a group of 15 people, and defeat them in different sporting events. It is learned that the 14 devils were not his allies, but Razor's own ability to emit 14 Nen creatures at will. He is defeated in a dodgeball game by Gon's allied party (consisting of Gon, Killua, Biscuit, Hisoka, and several other players hired by Battera). Razor reveals to Gon that he is a death row convict captured by Ging and brought to the island.

Kakin
 is a kingdom located in the middle of the Azian Continent that experienced quick economic growth after shifting from social imperialism to a parliamentary democracy 30 years ago in what was called the "Most Silent Revolution in History". Since then it has sought to expand its influence internationally and after announcing an expedition to the Dark Continent, the V5 offer Kakin a seat among them, extending the council to six countries and renaming it the V6, in order to gain control over the expedition and its spoils, as well as to prevent possible predicaments. All of the ruler's legitimate children receive the official title of "prince", regardless of sex, and are ranked according to their order of birth, although the ranks grant few special privileges over each other and act mostly as a means to address them. The illegitimate children, on the other hand, are forbidden from appearing in public or taking part in the kingdom's politics and have their faces slashed with razors twice, leaving scars as proof of their lower status. To choose its next ruler, a deadly game among the princes is being held to decide the rightful successor on board the giant Dark Continent transport ship titled the Black Whale No.1, a fact that is hidden from the public. The princes each acquire a , a parasitic Nen Beast that feeds on their aura and metamorphoses into a form and ability based on their disposition, that they can not see or control via the Seed Urn Ceremony before boarding the ship.

Although he was born as an Enhancer, Kastro's ability completely ignores his strengths and uses Conjuration and Manipulation. Furthermore, his conjured doppelgänger is also flawed in that although Kastro gets dirtied from blows dealt to him, it remains spotless in combat due to it being merely a reflection of what he sees of himself, thus making it easy to distinguish between the two.
