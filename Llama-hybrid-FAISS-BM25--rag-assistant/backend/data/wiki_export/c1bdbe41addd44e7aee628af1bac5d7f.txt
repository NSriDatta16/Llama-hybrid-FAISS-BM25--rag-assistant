The Australian Children's Choir (ACC), founded in 1976, is a mixed-voice children's choir based in Melbourne, Australia, and consisting of some 200 boys and girls aged 5 to 20 in six different training ensembles. The choir has developed a strong reputation for its refined performances, varied repertoire and the production of fine young musicians, many of whom have gone on to pursue successful musical careers.

Members 

There are approximately 200 singers in the choir, ranging in age from 5 to 20, and composed of five groups: Lyrebirds, Melody, Harmony, Intermediate, Treble, and Senior Choristers. The young singers who comprise the Senior Choir of the Australian Children's Choir meet twice a week to rehearse outside school hours, and must demonstrate a high degree of musical ability, personal organisation and concentration to become join its ranks. In return, they receive many musical and social opportunities, and take on the role of young ambassadors for both the ACC and their country.
