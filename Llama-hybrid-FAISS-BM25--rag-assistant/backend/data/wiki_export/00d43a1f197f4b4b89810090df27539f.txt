The Leicester and District Football League is an association football competition based in England. The league has three divisions, of which the highest, the Premier Division, sits at level 12 of the English football league system and is a feeder to the Leicestershire Senior League. There are also two reserve divisions which are not part of the league system.

Clubs are allowed to pay players at this level, however in the 2005â€“06 season, the only Premier Division side that paid players, Barlestone St Giles, came second, allowing Cosby United to take the crown.  Cosby were unable to enter the Leicestershire Senior League, however, as their facilities did not meet Senior League standards.
