Fresco is the fourth and final to date studio album by the British dance band M People. It includes the Top 10 singles "Just for You" and "Angel St", the single "Fantasy Island", and a cover version of the Roxy Music song "Avalon".  The album reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart, and was supported by a large UK arena tour.  The tour confirmed M People as one of the UK's most successful live acts of the 1990s.  Fresco became M People's last studio album to date as the group has not released any new material since.  Various hit collections followed as well as two solo albums from lead singer Heather Small.  By the end of 1998, Fresco had sold over 750,000 copies in the UK.
