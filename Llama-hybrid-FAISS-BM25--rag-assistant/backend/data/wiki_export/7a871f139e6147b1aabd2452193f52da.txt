History
The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation was founded in 1924 by Florence (n√©e Shloss) and Daniel Guggenheim.

Between 1930 and 1941 the foundation financed Robert H. Goddard. When the United States government settled a patent lawsuit for infringing the Goddard patent for liquid fuel rockets, that money was awarded to the foundation.

The foundation was terminated on June 30, 2011. The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation Program on Demography, Technology and Criminal Justice has taken over some of the functions.
