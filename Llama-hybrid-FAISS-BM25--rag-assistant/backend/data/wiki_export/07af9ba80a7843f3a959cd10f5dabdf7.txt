After the Centre Democrats left the government coalition in 1996, the sitting Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was able to form a government coalition of his own Social Democrats and the Danish Social Liberal Party. The resulting cabinet, which replaced the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen II, was formed on 30 December 1996 and was called the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen III.

The cabinet was replaced by the Cabinet of Poul Nyrup Rasmussen IV on 23 March 1998 after the 1998 Danish parliamentary election.
