History
The first European settlement on record occurred in 1876 when Manoel Batista Barroso, travelling medicine salesman, and Gabriel Paula do Amaral, settled on the right bank of the Cachoeira Alta River, five kilometers above where it meets the Rio Claro.  In 1920 the town had grown and was officially called Cachoeira Alta, because of the river.  In 1931 it became a district belonging to Rio Verde, being raised to municipal status in 1953.
