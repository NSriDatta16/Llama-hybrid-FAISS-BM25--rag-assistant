David Boyle, 1st Earl of Glasgow (c. 1666 – 31 October 1733) was a Scottish politician and peer. He was the last Treasurer-depute before the Union with England.

Early life
David Boyle was born circa 1666 at Kelburn Castle, Fairlie, in North Ayrshire, Scotland. He was the son of John Boyle of Kelburn (d. 1685), a Shire Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland for Bute, and Marion Steuart, daughter of Sir Walter Steuart of Allanton.

Career

From 1689 to 1699, Boyle was the Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland from the Bute constituency. In 1697, he was invested as Privy Counsellor. He was Rector of Glasgow University from 1690 to 1691, as well as the last Treasurer-depute before the Union with England.

The Earl was a supporter of the Acts of Union, and after their passage, he sat as a Scottish representative peer from 1707 to 1710, serving alongside his first wife's nephew, John Lindsay, 19th Earl of Crawford (d. 1713).  In Scotland, some claimed that union would enable Scotland to recover from the financial disaster wrought by the Darien scheme through English assistance and the lifting of measures put in place through the Alien Act of 1705 to force the Scottish Parliament into compliance with the Act of Settlement. As many Commissioners had invested heavily in the Darien Scheme, they believed that they would receive compensation for their losses of which Article 15 granted £398,085 10s sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt, that was in essence used as a means of compensation for investors in the Company of Scotland's Darien Scheme. In total, £20,000 (£240,000 Scots) was dispatched to Scotland, of which £12,325, more than 60% of the funding, was distributed to Boyle and The Duke of Queensbury, the Commissioner in Parliament.

He was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1706, and in 1707 to 1710. He was also Lord Clerk Register prior to 1714.

Peerage

On 31 January 1699, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Boyle of Kelburn, Stewartoun, Cumbrae, Finnick, Largs and Dalry, with a special remainder to all of his heirs male whatsoever. On 12 April 1703, he advanced to the titles of Viscount of Kelburn and Earl of Glasgow, with a special remainder to all of his heirs male whatsoever.
