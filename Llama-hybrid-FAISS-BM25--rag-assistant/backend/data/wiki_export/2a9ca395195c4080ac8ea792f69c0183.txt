Ghosh or Ghose () is a native Bengali surname that is found among the Bengali Hindu community of India and Bangladesh.

Ghoshes mostly belong to Kayastha caste in Bengal. The Bengali Kayasthas evolved as a caste from a category of officials or scribes, between the 5th/6th century AD and 11th/12th century AD, its component elements being putative Kshatriyas and mostly Brahmins. Ghoshes are considered as Kulin Kayasthas of Soukalin gotra, along with Boses, Guhas and Mitras.

Ghosh is also used as surname by the Sadgop and Goala/Gowala (caste) in Bengal.
