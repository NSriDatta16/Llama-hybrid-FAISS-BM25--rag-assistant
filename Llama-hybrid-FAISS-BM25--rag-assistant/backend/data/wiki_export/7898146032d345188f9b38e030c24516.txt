Stadio Vanni Sanna (formerly known as Stadio Acquedotto) is a multi-use stadium in Sassari, Italy.  It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of S.E.F. Torres 1903 and U.S.D. Latte Dolce.  The stadium holds 12,000.

History
Its first name was "Torres stadium", changed in the seventies to "Acquedotto stadium". On 22 August 2001 it changed its name and was named after Giovanni Sanna, a footballer originally from Alghero who in his career played in Torres 1903 first as a player, then as a coach and sports director. In 2013, a restyling project of the municipal stadium of Sassari was presented, developed with red and blue passion by the Sassari architects Marco Tola and Stefano Sechi, and presented yesterday by the Associazione Memoria storico Torresina and the Sef Torres 1903 Foundation with great enthusiasm. In 2020 an agreement was reached between the Torres club and the Municipality of Sassari to manage the stadium for the next 15 years and in 2021 a new turf was set up in order to improve and redevelop the structure.
