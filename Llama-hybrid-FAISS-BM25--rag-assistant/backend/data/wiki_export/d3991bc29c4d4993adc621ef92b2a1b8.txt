Border Corridor Wildlife Refuge () is a wildlife refuge, running through Guanacaste, Arenal Huetar Norte and Tortuguero Conservation Areas, in the northern part of Costa Rica running as a 2,000 metre wide strip of land along the border with Nicaragua. 

It was created in 1994 by decree 22962-MIRENEM, and there are no public facilities specifically for this refuge. The refuge contains a number of research programs of varying disciplines.

This refuge is partially disturbed but includes beaches, dry forests, wetlands, moist forests and coastal lagoons.
