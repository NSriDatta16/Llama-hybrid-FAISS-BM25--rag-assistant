Bosworth charges up to £40,890 a year making it one of the most expensive schools in the UK. The school offers scholarships, one being the ‘Scholarship Of Excellence’, awarded to those who go onto study at Oxbridge. This scholarship consists of the previous two years of course and accommodation fees being reimbursed upon attendance of the first semester. Although typically scholarships are  worth 30% of the course and/ or boarding fees. Yet places are exclusive in the school as is publicity due to a large number of UHNWI and celebrities children attending.
