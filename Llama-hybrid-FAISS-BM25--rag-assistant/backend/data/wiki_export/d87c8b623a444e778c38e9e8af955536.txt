"La Di Da Di" is a song performed by Doug E. Fresh, who provides the beatboxed instrumental, and MC Ricky D (later known as Slick Rick), who performs the vocals. It was originally released in 1985 as the B-side to "The Show". The song has since gained a reputation as an early hip hop classic, and it is one of the most sampled songs in history.

Content 
"La Di Da Di" is a light-hearted party song wherein MC Ricky D (Slick Rick) tells a seemingly autobiographical story of a typical day in which he wakes up, bathes, gets dressed, and upon leaving his apartment is accosted by a female love interest, and then by her mother.

Different edits
There are two releases of the song. The original vinyl and cassette versions contain sung lyrics from "Sukiyaki" by A Taste of Honey, but due to a lack of clearance, CD versions are missing the following [slightly modified] refrains in the middle of the song:

"It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is [filled with] rainy day[s]
[And] I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me"

Snoop Dogg covered "La Di Da Di" (titled "Lodi Dodi") on his 1993 debut album Doggystyle.
