IPS Salinero (formerly Keltec Salinero and Gestion Salinero; 6 May 1994 – December 2022) was a horse ridden by the Dutch equestrian Anky van Grunsven in the sport of dressage.

Sjef Janssen originally purchased the horse for American Tess Guilder. After it preformed well at the lower levels, Sjef and his wife Anky purchased him for themselves.

Anky van Grunsven had achieved success with Salinero winning the individual gold medal at the 2004 and 2008 Olympic Games and additional international Grand Prix. On Salinero, she won the title at Aachen in 2004, making her the first Dutch rider to win there.

In late 2008, Salinero competed under the name "IPS Salinero," changed from the former Gestion Salinero and Keltec Salinero.

At age 16 (2010), Salinero retired from shows, however an injury to van Grunsven's IPS Upido caused her to bring Salinero back for the 2012 Olympics. Salinero's return was at CDIO Saumur (26–29 April 2012), where the combination placed second.

On 24 June 2012, Salinero and Anky van Grunsven were officially added to the 2012 Dutch Olympic Dressage Team along with Adelide Cornelissen (Parzival) and Edward Gal (Undercover).
Van Grunsven and Salinero turned in a performance that helped to capture the team bronze medal for the Netherlands on 2 August 2012, even though Van Grunsven's husband and national team coach, Sjef Janssen, had gotten violently ill the previous night. Salinero's last ride came at the Olympic Individual Dressage Competition on 9 August 2012. The 18-year-old horse posted a score of 82.000%, which earned sixth place overall. Salinero retired to pasture at van Grunsven's residence in the Netherlands.

Salinero died in December 2022, at the age of 28.
