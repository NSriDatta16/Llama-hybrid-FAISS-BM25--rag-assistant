Miramar is a residential district (zona residencial) of the municipality of Playa, in the city of Havana.

Overview
Many embassies, including the landmark Russian Embassy, are located in Miramar - in particular on Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue) before called Avenida de las Américas (Avenue of the Americas).

Prior to the Revolution, the neighborhood was home to many of Havana's upscale residents.  There are many large houses and mansions here.  This district and the Country Club (Cubanacán) were the most glamorous spaces in the Havana of the 50s.  There are also some of Havana's more modern hotels, such as Hotel Melia Habana, Oasis Panorama Hotel and Occidental Miramar, beaches and private rental houses (known as casas particulares).  Also located here is the International School of Havana.

Since the late 1990s, several office blocks have been built in a complex called Centro de Negocios Miramar - the "Miramar Trade Center".
