The 2006–07 network television schedule for the six major English language commercial broadcast networks in the United States. The schedule covers prime time hours from September 2006 through August 2007. The schedule is followed by a list per network of returning series, new series, and series cancelled after the 2005–06 season.

PBS is not included; member stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary. Ion Television (renamed from its original rebrand, i: Independent Television, on January 27) is also not included since the network's schedule consisted mainly of syndicated reruns and movies.

The schedules include the four most popular networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox) and two new networks introduced as part of the broadcast TV realignment: The CW and MyNetworkTV.

New series are highlighted in bold.

All times are U.S. Eastern and Pacific Time (except for some live sports or events). Subtract for one hour for Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii-Aleutian times.

Each of the 30 highest-rated shows is listed with its rank and rating as determined by Nielsen Media Research.
