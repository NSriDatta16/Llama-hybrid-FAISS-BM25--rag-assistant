History
This school was formerly the Belgrade-Elrosa and Brooten school districts. When these schools did not have enough children to keep the schools running, they merged in 1989. However, Belgrade-Elrosa elementary school did not merge with Brooten until 1994.

In 2005, BBE had their first state team participant, winning the 6AA championship in volleyball. They lost to Stewartville and St. Cloud Cathedral. Volleyball went to state again in 2007 (section 6AA champions), losing to Mayer Lutheran and St. Cloud Cathedral.

In 2011, BBE made it to state with their Boys Basketball team.  Their only loss of the year came in the state championship against Springfield, which gave them a record of 32–1, and second overall. Also, in 2012, they again made it to finals and played Southwest Minnesota Christian and won class 1A championship, finishing the school's first ever "perfect season" going 33–0. In 2014, the Boys Basketball team claimed their second state championship with a 62–50 defeat of Rushford-Peterson.

In 2013, the football team made it to the section finals but lost in the final seconds to ACGC.

The girls volleyball team has made it to State in 2018 and 2019. The girls basketball team made it to state for the first time ever in 2019.
