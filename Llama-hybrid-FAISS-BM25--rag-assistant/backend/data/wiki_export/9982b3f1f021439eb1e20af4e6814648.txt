Some Success Stories 
1. The Interpol had requested CFPB to compare finger print and demographic details of BARRIOS GUARIN Jose Mauricio with existing records in connection with Identification of an International Fugitive wanted for Homicide in Colombia (South America) vide Ref. No. 203/2010F.  It was ascertained that the fingerprint of BARRIOS GUARIN Jose Mauricio was IDENTICAL with the Right Index (RI) finger impression present on the specimen 10-digit F.P. slip of MAITA RODRIGUEZ Perd Alejandro, hence the two finger prints were found to be of one and the same person.

2. A fingerprint slip pertaining to one Singh Iqbal was forwarded by Interpol for record purpose. This slip was processed in FACTS (CFPB-AFIS) and was found to be a ‘trace’ against a record slip archived with CFPB PIN 604744. The successful search brought to light the criminal antecedents of the subjected person, who was convicted in pursuance of criminal case registered vide FIR No. 34 dated 24.09.1996 in the court of SDJM, Nabha on 20.09.2000 U/s 324/34 IPC

3. Interpol search slip from New Zealand Police vide Case Reference No. A&SP/New Zealand/FP /2016/454 Dt. 12-02-2016 was traced against the F.P. slip bearing PID No. 90474919 present in CFPB data base, of one Arvinder Pal Singh S/o Malkeet Singh R/o H. No. 53, Professor Enclave, opposite Punjabi University, Patiala, Punjab.

4. The NIA suspected that N.Shanti Metei chief of PREPAK (UPPK), a banned terrorist organization active in anti-national activities was using forged documents, and false identities, Thorough comparison of the fingerprints of T. Hemanta Sharma on land agreements, sale deeds etc., and specimen fingerprints of N.Shanti Metei, proved that N. Shanti Metei used a pseudonym for illegal purchases.

5. The Ordnance Factory, Ministry of Defence, Raipur, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, doubted the authenticity of the final list of 54-candidates selected through written and trade tests conducted by them. The CFPB compared the finger prints of all provisionally selected candidates, After thorough examination, the expert in the Bureau was able to discern, that in three cases the finger impressions were different, from one another, indicating impersonation on the part of the candidates.

6. Document case received from Dy. Director of Income Tax (inv.) relating to a search and seizure operation u/s 132 of the Income Tax Act 1961 in a case of M/s National Enterprises and Group and recovered some documents.. The documents consisted of 1536 pages with eight to twelve thumb prints on each page (i.e. over 12000 prints in total). After examination of the document, CFPB experts were able to establish that all the prints were given by 8 to 10 fingers only indicating fraudulent payment of approximately 2.25 crores. Approximately 40% finger impressions were faint, blurred or partial.

7. A total of fifty five (55) fingerprint slips for establishing identity were received in FACTS (CFPB-AFIS) from Uttarakhand State police Department. The slips carried fingerprints of Unidentified Dead Bodies (UDBs). Majority of fingerprints were faint, smudged, or partial. All the slips required additional computer based enhancement efforts to make them decipherable for comparison by the system. Out of the 55 slips, one unidentified dead body fingerprint slip matched with the slip of one Jamil S/o. Mustaq of P.S. Kithore, Meerut, U.P. The successful input of UDB Fingerprint slip (CFPB PIN No. 90440105) followed by trace with slip bearing PIN 90423149, revealed the antecedents of the subjected person - Jamil was convicted in pursuance of criminal case registered vide FIR No. 60 dated 19-03-2013 U/S 363 IPC of ODRS police station.

Revelations from Crime Statistics 
The NCRB data 2020 brought out glaring statistics that pointed out married men committed more suicide due to family problems. The statistics went further to point out that one man commits suicide every 5 minutes. 

The Crime Records also pointed out a very pertinent fact that over 74% of rape cases and 80% dowry cases filed in India end in acquittal which suggest there is a growing trend of false cases being filed by women against men to meet their needs and use the Gender Biased Laws to their favor. Interpreting the statistics and also drawing inference from the own lessons, Delhi High Court pointed out that there is an alarming rise in false rape cases in India and this must be checked at the earliest.

News Letter 
A quarterly publication named NCRB New Letter is also compiled and published by the Training Branch and circulated to the police fraternity to make them aware about NCRB achievements/activities.
