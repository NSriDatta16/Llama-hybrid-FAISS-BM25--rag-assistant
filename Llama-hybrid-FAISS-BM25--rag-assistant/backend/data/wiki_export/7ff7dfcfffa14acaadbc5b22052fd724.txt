He studied privately with such artists as trumpeter Bobby Shew and jazz vibraphonist Charlie Shoemake. "Of the 1,500 or so people that studied with me, Kye was one of those 20 or 25 players that was really important, who understood the music", Charlie Shoemake says. Palmer names Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard as his principal influences.
