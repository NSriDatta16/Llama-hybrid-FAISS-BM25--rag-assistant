Historical background

The university started as the Araneta Institute of Agriculture (AIA), an agricultural school at Hacarin Dairy Farm in Hacienda Carmelita, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. On November 24, 1947, AIA transferred to Victoneta Park, Malabon, Rizal to bring the school closer to the populace.

AIA initially started a two-year course, the Associate in Agriculture and Certificate of Proficiency in Vocational Education with only 35 students. Thereafter, the offering of other related academic programs in agriculture commenced.

In recognition of its contributions in the fields of agricultural education, research, and extension services, it was transformed into a university on January 15, 1958. Nine years later, it was converted into a foundation, the first university to be organized under Republic Act No.6055 concerning the conversion of educational institutions, and became known as the Araneta University Foundation. By virtue of a resolution approved by the board of trustees in 1978, the university was renamed the Gregorio Araneta University Foundation''.

As the curricular programs changed and the student population increased, different institutes of learning and disciplines were created. In 1991, the different institutes became "colleges." Preliminary talks and discussions on the integration of GAUF into the De La Salle University System started as early as 1987. On February 20, 2002, the Board of Trustees approved with the consent of the Araneta family, the integration of GAUF into the DLSU System, making it the seventh member of the system, becoming the De La Salle-Araneta University'''.
