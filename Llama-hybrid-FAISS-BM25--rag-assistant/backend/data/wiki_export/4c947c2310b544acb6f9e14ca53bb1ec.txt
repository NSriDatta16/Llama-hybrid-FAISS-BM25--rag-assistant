Steven Lee Bucknall  (born 17 March 1966) is a retired English professional basketball player, and former head coach of British Basketball League (BBL) expansion franchise London Capital.

A 1.98 m (6'6") and 97.5 kg (215 lbs.) shooting guard, Bucknall was the third English-born player in the United States' NBA and the first who actually grew up in his country of birth, where he started playing as a Junior at Crystal Palace Basketball Club in London. He played for the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he had a brief stint after graduating from the University of North Carolina.

Prior to matriculation at the University of North Carolina, he played high school basketball for Governor Dummer Academy, now known as The Governor's Academy, which is part of the ISL (Independent School League).

He subsequently went on to play in a number of European countries including Greece, France, Italy as well as his native UK.

Prior to his retirement, Bucknall played for the bronze medal-winning English basketball team in the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006. He also has a son Marcus Bucknall who plays for Mandoulides Thessaloniki. He follows his father's footsteps, playing for the All-Thassaloniki team.
