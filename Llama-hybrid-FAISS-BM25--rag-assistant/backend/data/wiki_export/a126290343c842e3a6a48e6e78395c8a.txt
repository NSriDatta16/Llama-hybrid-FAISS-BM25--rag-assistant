Ullerøy Church

Ullerøy Church  (Ullerøy kirke) was finished in 1725. It was constructed of wood and seats 160 people. There is also a cemetery by the church.

Etymology 
The Norse form of the name was Ullarøy. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the Norse god Ullr. The last element is øy, meaning "island".  The former island was later turned into a peninsula because of post-glacial rebound.  A neighbouring headland has the name Torsnes.
