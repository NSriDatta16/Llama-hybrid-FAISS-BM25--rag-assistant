He joined the BBC as a studio manager, before going on to become a television announcer. In 1972 he left this position to join the Radiophonic Workshop, where he remained until 1995. Although he had received formal music training, he also spent much time in pop and jazz bands, the influence of which can be heard in much of his music.

Limb is best known for his work on Doctor Who, for which, between 1981 and 1985, he composed the music for the serials The Keeper of Traken, Four to Doomsday, Black Orchid, Time-Flight, Arc of Infinity, Terminus, The Caves of Androzani and Revelation of the Daleks.

For the latter programme he also composed the cult favourite "Magic E" song as well as the popular education songs "Bill the Brickie", "Dog Detective" and "The Punctuation Song". His music was also used in documentaries, including Bellamy's Backyard Safari and Submarine: Perisher: Million Pound Captains.

He also composed and played "Swirley", a cheerful piece of electronic music that was used as the theme to the BBC's Service Information news bulletins in the late 1970s/early 1980s, and arranged the songs for several series of the BBC Schools programme You and Me, featuring Cosmo and Dibs. 

Limb was the composer of the music used in the Protect and Survive films, produced by the British government in the late 1970s to be broadcast in the event of imminent nuclear attack.

His recording "Passing Clouds" was included on the 1976 LP Out of This World, a compilation of sound effects. This track was used by Prince at the beginning of "Eye No", the opening track of 1988's Lovesexy. Out of This World was reissued in 1991 on CD as the "Essential Science Fiction Sound Effects, Volume 2"
