The Roar of Love is a 1980 concept album and fourth studio album by Christian band 2nd Chapter of Acts, that recounts the story of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first published book in The Chronicles of Narnia, a series by C. S. Lewis. It was recorded in 1976, prior to their third studio album Mansion Builder, but its release was delayed by contractual and copyright issues. According to band member Matthew Ward, all the vocals were cut in a bedroom of the house the trio lived in at the time. They converted their garage into a mixing room, knocked a hole in the bedroom wall and ran a microphone cord into it. The songs have a heavy use of synthesizers. It was reissued on the Live Oak label.

Track listing 

All songs were written by Annie Herring except "White Stag" (music by Matthew Ward and lyrics by Matthew Ward, Nellie Greisen and Annie Herring).

Note: On the later CD and iTunes releases, tracks 6 and 7 are combined into one simply titled "Christmas, Where Are You?", for a total of 13 tracks.
