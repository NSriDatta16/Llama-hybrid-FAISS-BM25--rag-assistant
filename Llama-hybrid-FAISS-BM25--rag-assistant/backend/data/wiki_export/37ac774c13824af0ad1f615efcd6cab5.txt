Geography

Parvin State Park is in Pittsgrove Township, Salem County, New Jersey, 5 miles west of Vineland, in an agricultural area. The largest lake in the park is Parvin Lake, which occupies much of the eastern corner of the park and into which flows a stream, the Muddy Run; there is a smaller lake, Thundergust Lake, to the south of Parvin Lake.

About  of the park are designated as the Parvin Natural Area.

Ecology
Parvin State Park is in an area of transition between the Pine Barrens and hardwood forest and includes a variety of terrain; its ecology is therefore unusually diverse, including areas of hardwood and white cedar swamp, lowland pine forest, and upland pine and oak forest. The park's at least 50 species of trees include white cedar, pitch pine, red maple, several species of oak, black cherry, and winterberry holly. Common types of bushes in the park include greenbrier, wild azaleas, mountain laurel, and sweet pepperbush. The endangered swamp pink grows in the park.

The park has at least 180 species of birds. The wild turkey, barred owl, yellow-billed cuckoo, and many species of warblers live in the park's forests. The lakes and Muddy Run are habitats of the prothonotary warbler, the great blue and green heron, the great egret, and more than a dozen species of ducks; black-crowned night herons, pied-billed grebes, and ospreys are also seen on the lakes occasionally.

History
There are remains of Lenape encampments near the park. The first recorded European settlement in the area was in 1742. In 1796, Lemuel Parvin settled in what is now the park and dammed the Muddy Run stream to power a sawmill, thus creating Parvin Lake.

In 1930, the state of New Jersey bought 918 acres of land in what is now the park, and from 1933 to 1941 the Civilian Conservation Corps developed the park. The park was used in 1943 as a summer camp for the children of interned Japanese Americans, in 1944 as a prisoner of war camp for German soldiers from the Afrika Korps, and in 1952 as temporary housing for Kalmyk Americans who fled their homelands in the USSR.
