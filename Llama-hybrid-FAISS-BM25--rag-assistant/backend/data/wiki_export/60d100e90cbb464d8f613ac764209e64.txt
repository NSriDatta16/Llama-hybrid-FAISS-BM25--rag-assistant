Release history

Trivia
 "1985" was reworked, with a slightly different melody and lyrics, by Bowling for Soup for their 2004 album A Hangover You Don't Deserve. It was released as a single and achieved good chart ratings. SR-71's frontman, Mitch Allan, appeared in the music video for the song.
 "Here We Go Again" was covered and re-recorded by alternative pop punk band JParis for their second album Call It What You Want in 2006, an album which was produced by Mitch Allan.
 A CD single was made for the song "Axl Rose", and was available through the band's website. "Here We Go Again", "All American" and a censored version of "All American" were the b-side tracks. 
 A follow-up album is not expected by the band, due to other projects. Mitch Allan hoped to release his solo album in 2008, but it was delayed ever since and has very likely been canceled. According to Mitch Allan's Myspace page, it was known that the song "Mosquito" from this album would also have been featured on his solo album.
 At the time of the release of the album, former bassist Jeff Reid had lung cancer, and died weeks later, on June 11.
