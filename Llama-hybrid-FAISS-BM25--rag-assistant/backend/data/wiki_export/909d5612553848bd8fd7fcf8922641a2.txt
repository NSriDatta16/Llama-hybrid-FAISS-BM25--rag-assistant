Wolfgang Schwarz (born 14 September 1947, in Vienna) is an Austrian former figure skater. He is the 1968 Olympic gold medalist (one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic champions), a two-time (1967–1968) World silver medalist, and three-time (1967–1969) European silver medalist. Prior to the Grenoble Olympics, he had finished second to Austrian teammate Emmerich Danzer multiple times at the World and European Championships.

In December 2002, Schwarz was convicted on charges of trafficking in human beings after he brought five women from Russia and Lithuania to Austria to work as prostitutes. He was given an 18-month sentence, postponed due to his skin cancer. In December 2005, he was acquitted in a separate case of human trafficking. In August 2006, he was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison for plotting a kidnapping of a Romanian teenager.
