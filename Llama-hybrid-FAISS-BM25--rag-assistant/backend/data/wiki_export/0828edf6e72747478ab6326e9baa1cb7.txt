St Goran is a coastal civil parish in Cornwall, England, UK, six miles (10Â km) south-southwest of St Austell. The largest settlement in the parish is the coastal village of Gorran Haven, a mile to the east with a further cluster of homes at Trevarrick.

The parish is bounded by the sea to the east and south. It is bordered by St Michael Caerhays parish to the west and by St Ewe and Mevagissey parishes to the north.

The patron saint Guron or Goronus is said to have come here from Bodmin. The parish church is a fine building of the 15th century though the foundation is Norman. Features of interest include the bench ends and the late medieval font. At Gorran Haven is a 15th-century chapel of St Just, restored in the 1860s. At Bodrugan, there are some remains of the medieval manor house of the Bodrugans which also had a chapel.
