2000 – present

The 4th AABn has provided augmentation to its sister Assault Amphibian Battalions in the Regular Marine Corps during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. These latter battalions were in the 1st Marine Division and 2nd Marine Division.

4th AABN was activated in January 2003 and deployed to the Middle East in February 2003. The Marines held camp in Camp Matilda, Kuwait before the initial push into Iraq. On March 18, 2003 only hours after President George W. Bush's speech and aerial attacks on the country, all convoys were staged to push into Iraq borders. Weeks later, Bravo Company (-) reservists were the first of the battalion to set foot in Baghdad. Although destroyed bridges were an obstacle to many units, the AAV's ability to cross the major rivers was an integral part of the overall mission.

The 4th AABn has deployed company sized elements in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa.

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Alpha Company 3rd Platoon Marines stationed at Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi, deployed when the backside of Hurricane Katrina was still pounding south Mississippi. The Marines ventured out into 70 plus mile per hour winds and navigated through a wall of water that Katrina dumped on Gulfport and Biloxi. At one point during the storm, the Marines picked up some Biloxi police and firefighters and together, they looked past the flooded roads and the storm soaked yards for anyone who appeared to be trapped.

Bravo Company (-) reservists from Jacksonville, Florida, deployed to the New Orleans in support of rescue and recovery operations. The unit was active for an estimated three weeks until active duty units could arrive and take over operations. While in the Area of Operations (AO), B(-) ran rescue operation on a daily basis, even while Marines were injured due to the conditions after the destruction of the storm. B(-) made it to the AO within 96 hours of the storms passing, commanding the AAV-7A1 down the I-10 corridor. Upon arrival to New Orleans, in 10 AAV units, the Marines began to commence search and rescue operations before arriving at their base of operation at Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans.

Alpha Company, 4th Assault Amphibian Battalion, was deployed to Iraq in 2008 to support Regimental Combat Team 5. There they conducted provisional infantry missions as Helo Quick Reaction Force and other infantry operations throughout the Al Anbar province.  They also assisted with the retrograde of excess equipment out of Iraq and into Afghanistan or back to the United States.

Bravo Company, 4th Assault Amphibian Battalion, was deployed in 2009 to Al Asad, Iraq, attached to 1st Battalion, 8th Marines.  While attached to 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, several legal issues plagued the company. The most well known incident was that a vehicle assigned to the company was found to have several gallons of water in the fuel tank. While an intense and lengthy investigation was conducted, no one was ever found guilty of the destruction of government property.

In 2011, the unit also participated in the Landing Force Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (LF CARAT) exercises in Thailand.
