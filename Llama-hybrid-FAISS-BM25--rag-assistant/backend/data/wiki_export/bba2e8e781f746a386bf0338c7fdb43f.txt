She died, after a brief illness, in New York City on April 25, 1989, at the age of 50. She had a husband, Erwin Fleissner, and two daughters.

Klein was best known for her adult novel Sunshine, about a young woman with  terminal cancer, which was based upon a true story, and taken from the young woman's tape-recorded diary. She was also well known for her children's novel Mom, the Wolfman and Me about a girl with an unmarried mother. Ms. Klein's work dealt openly with controversial subjects, including racism, homosexuality, adoption, and death.
