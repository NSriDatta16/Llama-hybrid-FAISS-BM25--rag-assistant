Death and funeral
Bishop Dixon died 29 June 1996 at the Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, where he had been a patient. He had been looking forward to being discharged, and a planned trip.  "His death was sudden and unexpected," according to the Rev. Jerry J. Smith, Assistant to then-Bishop of the San Antonio Area, Bishop Ray Owen.

Bishop Dixon's funeral service was held 3 July 1996 at the University U.M. Church, San Antonio, with burial in Edna, Texas.  He was survived by his wife Ernestine Gray Clark Dixon, and four children:  the Rev. Freddie B. Dixon Sr. of Austin, Texas; Leona Louise Thomas and Muriel Jean Dixon, both of San Antonio; and Sherryl Dianne Blue of Washington, D.C.  Bishop Dixon's first wife, Lois, died of cancer in 1977.  A son, Ernest Reese Dixon, died in 1990.

The Rev. Smith, a former member of Bishop Dixon's Cabinet, remembered him as a "distinguished" and "dynamic" and "much loved" leader who rose from humble beginnings on the east side of San Antonio to become a religious leader of the entire city.  "We are proud that he came to serve the place of his birth," Smith said.
