The following are the association football events of the year 2010 throughout the world.

News
In 2010, the two top-level leagues in the United States both added at least one new team:
 Major League Soccer, which also has one team in Canada and is recognized as the top level of the (men's) sport in that country, added its 16th team, Philadelphia Union, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Pennsylvania.
 Women's Professional Soccer, which currently has teams only in the United States, added two teams to the six teams returning from its inaugural 2009 season:
 The Atlanta Beat, the new incarnation of a team from the defunct Women's United Soccer Association, who play in the Atlanta suburb of Kennesaw, Georgia.
 Philadelphia Independence, sister team to Philadelphia Union. Due to construction delays at the  new stadium it will eventually share with Union, Independence played their first season in another Philadelphia suburb, West Chester, Pennsylvania.

However, during the 2010 WPS season, another charter team, Saint Louis Athletica, folded, bringing WPS back to the same number of teams it had in the 2009 season. The league also lost its season champions, FC Gold Pride, and the Chicago Red Stars, although it will add an expansion team in Western New York for 2011.

Following the 2010 MLS regular season, the Kansas City Wizards announced a name change to Sporting Kansas City.
