Algeciras Club de Fútbol is a Spanish football team based in Algeciras, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Founded in 1909 it plays in Primera División RFEF – Group 1, holding home matches at Estadio Nuevo Mirador.

History 
Football became of interest in Algeciras at the end of the 19th century from the British colony of Gibraltar. In their early years the teams of the city played in several sand fields around the city; one of these provisional camps was located near the fairgrounds of the city El Calvario. This field was the first in where Algeciras CF played its matches. The club was officially founded in 1909.

When the club was founded, it did not have an official t-shirt, so they played with the players own clothes. But when they started to play very often, they decided that it was the moment to use new and exclusive equipment. In that moment, it was very difficult to get sport equipment, so some people who worked for the club, went to Gibraltar looking for t-shirts. They chose a red and white t-shirt that belonged to an English team called Southampton Football Club. In that moment, the team played in different sand pitches near the city. El Polvorín or El Calvario were some of them,

In 1956, the club merged with UD España to form España de Algeciras CF before switching back to Algeciras CF in the following year. After this, the club played between Third division and Second B many years, including some declines to regional categories, with three promotions to the Second Division in 1978, 1983 and 2003.
