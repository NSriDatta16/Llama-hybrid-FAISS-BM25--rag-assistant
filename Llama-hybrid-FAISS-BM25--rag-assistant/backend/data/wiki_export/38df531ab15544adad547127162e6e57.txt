Quotes
Secession—peaceable secession, as it is called ... in fact rebellion.
Nothing but a rope of sand, of no strength whatever to hold the States together, and which may be broken at any moment.

Name
The name Bowditch in his name originates from Nathaniel Bowditch, a prominent author who worked with his father.
