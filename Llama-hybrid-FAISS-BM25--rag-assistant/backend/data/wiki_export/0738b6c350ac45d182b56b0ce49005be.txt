On 4 April 1903, Department of Actuarial Science () of the German Society for Insurance Science () — a predecessor to the current Association — was founded in Berlin.

Qualification Process

To become a member of the Association, a student needs to pass a series of examinations.  As of 2015, there are a total of nine exams specific to actuarial work, three more exams that deal with areas that affect actuaries but are not mathematical in their nature, and a specialisation exam.  There are also two exams to begin the qualification process if a student does not hold a degree in mathematical area. Students who have degrees in mathematics or finance are exempted from some of these exams.
