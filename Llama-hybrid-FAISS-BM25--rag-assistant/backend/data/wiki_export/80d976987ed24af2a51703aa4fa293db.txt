The Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 (3 Geo. 4. c. 71) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the long title "An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle"; it is sometimes known as Martin's Act, after the MP and animal rights campaigner Richard Martin. It is the first pieces of animal welfare legislation in recorded history.

The Act listed "ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep, or other cattle". This was held not to include bulls. A further act, the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 (5 & 6 Will. 4. c. 59, s. 2) extended the wording of this Act to remedy the issue.

This Act was repealed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1849.
