History

In Roman times, the town was called Cratia (Κρατεία) and was part of the Roman province of Honorias, whose capital was Claudiopolis in Honoriade.

Ecclesiastical history
Cratia was a metropolitan see, also called Flaviopolis or Flavianopolis. The names of some its bishops are known because of their participation in ecumenical councils: Epiphanius at the Council of Ephesus (431), Genethlius represented by the priest Eulogius at the Council of Chalcedon (451), Diogenes at the Second Council of Constantinople (553), Georgius at the Third Council of Constantinople (680–681), Constantinus or Constans at the Second Council of Nicea (787), Basilius at the Council of Constantinople (869), as well as at the Council of Constantinople (879). In addition, Philetus was one of the Eastern Arian bishops who withdrew from the Council of Sardica in about 344 and set up a rival council at Philippopolis. Paulus stood firm against the Empress Aelia Eudoxia in her persecution of John Chrysostom in 403. Plato was a member of a synod that met in 518. Abramius took part in the synod called in 536 by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople. No longer a residential bishopric, Cratia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

Ottoman period

Under the Ottoman Empire, Gerede was an established town and was visited by the 16th-century traveller Evliya Çelebi, who described a town of 1,000 homes and 10 mosques, with a military base.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Gerede was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

For many the name Gerede evokes Hüsrev Gerede, a key companion of Atatürk in the Turkish War of Independence (of 1919-1922). He was later given the surname Gerede for his success in leading the town's rebellion against the occupying forces during that conflict.
