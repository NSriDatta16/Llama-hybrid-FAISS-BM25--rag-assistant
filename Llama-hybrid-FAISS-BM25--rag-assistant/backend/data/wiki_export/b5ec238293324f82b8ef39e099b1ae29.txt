Contributions

Galloway has contributed significantly to academic literature in her field. She has worked with others in the discipline to author many books and papers. Her work on blunt force trauma outlines a theoretical framework for dealing with the many causes of death due to blunt force trauma including falls, strangulation, abuse, accidents and other causes. In addition, Galloway has authored work outlining decay rates in the dry Arizona climate. She has also argued that variances in formulas used to estimate height in adults needs to be consistent, and that the maximum height along with age altered heights be specified in forensic science reports in order to facilitate matching in missing person reports.
