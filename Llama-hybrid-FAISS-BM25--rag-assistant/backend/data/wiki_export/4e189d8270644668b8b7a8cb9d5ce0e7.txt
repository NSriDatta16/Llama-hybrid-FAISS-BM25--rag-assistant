Her childhood was deeply influenced by two people: her father, he was apparently a difficult man who was cold and ruthless, and her grandfather, who was the only one in the family who understood her. In her "Yong yuan de chong jing he zhui qiu" (Published on 1979) she writes, "Father often lost his humanity for the sake of greed. He treated his servants, his children, and my grandfather with the same miserliness and alienation, even ruthlessness." After her father beat Xiao Hong, she would hide in her grandfather's room.
