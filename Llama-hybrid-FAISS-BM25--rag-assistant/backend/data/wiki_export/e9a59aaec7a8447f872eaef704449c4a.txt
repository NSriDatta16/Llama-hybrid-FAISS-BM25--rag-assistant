Nairobi City Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Nairobi, Kenya. It is located east of the city centre. The stadium is owned by the Nairobi City Council.

Overview
The stadium was originally known as African Stadium, then renamed to Donholm Road Stadium. It was renamed to Jogoo Road Stadium after Kenya gained independence in 1963 and finally to Nairobi City Stadium.
