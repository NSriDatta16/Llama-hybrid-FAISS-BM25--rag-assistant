The South Coast League of Professional Baseball (SCL), based in Conyers, Georgia, was a professional, independent baseball organization located in the Southeastern United States.  It operated in cities not served by Major or Minor League Baseball teams and was not affiliated with either.  It folded after its first season in 2007.

History
The league was formed in October 2006.  In a press release in October, league Chief Executive Officer Jamie Toole, a former Carolina League executive with a number of teams, cited the desire to field professional baseball teams in municipalities that lacked access to professional baseball; however, the Aiken Foxhounds and Anderson Joes were based in metropolitan areas with an existing team in the MiLB-affiliated Class A South Atlantic League (the Augusta GreenJackets and Greenville Drive, respectively).

The league's only season was documented by the TV show, "Playing for Peanuts."

On March 29, 2008, Sports Illustrated reported that league CEO Jamie Toole had resigned and the league had canceled the 2008 season.
