Paseo de San Antonio station is an at-grade light rail station on the Blue Line and the Green Line of the VTA light rail system. The station platforms run along the Downtown San Jose transit mall, with the northbound platform located alongside 1st Street and the southbound platform located alongside 2nd Street. The two platforms are connected by a pedestrian plaza, the Paseo de San Antonio, after which the station is named.

The station is located close to the campus of San Jose State University.

History 
Paseo de San Antonio station was built as part of the second phase of what was then called the Guadalupe Line. The first phase opened on December 11, 1987, while the second phase opened about six months later on June 17, 1988, largely due to the complexity of building the transit mall in Downtown San Jose.

Paseo de San Antonio was renovated in 2006 to permit level boarding at all doors.
