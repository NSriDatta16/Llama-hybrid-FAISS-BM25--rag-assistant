History
Around 1920, Brisbane hotelier James (Jim) Cavill acquired twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land in an area known as Elston – the place known now as Surfers Paradise. The name James Cavill has always been connected with Surfers Paradise.  Dated back to 1923, Cavill paid £40 for a block of land. In 1925 he built the Surfers Paradise Hotel and is the namesake for Cavill Mall and Cavill Avenue. Then the bridge across the Nerang River was built, improving access to the hotel that, at the time, had a small zoo and a beer garden. During World War II, the hotel was used by convalescing soldiers, some of whom later returned with their wives and families.
