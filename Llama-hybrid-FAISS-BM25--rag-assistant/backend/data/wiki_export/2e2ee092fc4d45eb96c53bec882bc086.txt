Aslockton railway station serves the English villages of Aslockton and Whatton-in-the-Vale in Nottinghamshire. It also draws passengers from other nearby villages. It is 10 miles (17 km) east of Nottingham on the Nottingham–Skegness Line.

History
Passenger services from Aslockton started on 15 July 1850, when the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway opened its extension from Nottingham to Grantham. This was taken over by the Great Northern Railway. The station building designed by Thomas Chambers Hine was opened by the Great Northern Railway in 1857.

On 12 October 1868 a goods train that left Nottingham at 4.15 am split near Aslockton station when one of the coupling chains broke. The driver shunted on to the down line, and while it got back onto the up line, a goods train from Grantham ran into it. The driver of the Grantham train, Smalley Hutchinson, was killed and its fireman severely injured.

On 31 December 1904, George Skillington, aged 78, was killed on the line at Aslockton by a light engine.

The station became part of the London and North Eastern Railway under the Grouping of 1923.

On 23 July 1933 an excursion train from Skegness to Nottingham crashed through the level crossing gates at Aslockton. On 1 August 1937, a nine-year-old boy, Ernest Love of Sneinton, Nottingham, fell from a Nottingham to Mablethorpe excursion train at Aslockton and was killed.

The station passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. 

From 7 January 1963 passenger steam trains between Grantham, Bottesford, Elton and Orston, Aslockton, Bingham, Radcliffe-on-Trent, Netherfield and Colwick, Nottingham London-road (High Level) and Nottingham (Victoria) were replaced with diesel multiple-unit trains. 

When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. The station is now managed by East Midlands Railway.
