After his promising rookie season, Johnston pitched in just 5 games in , posting an ERA of 13.50. After the season Johnston was traded to the Pirates with pitcher Dennis Moeller for second baseman José Lind, and he rebounded to an ERA of 3.38 in 33 games. However, after brief trials producing poor ERAs of 29.70 (1994) and 11.25 (1995), Johnston pitched his final major league game on May 12, 1995.

In 1996, Johnston played in 18 games for the Tennessee Tomahawks of the Big South League, and in 1997 he played for the Wei Chuan Dragons of the Chinese Professional Baseball League, winning the Taiwan Series.
