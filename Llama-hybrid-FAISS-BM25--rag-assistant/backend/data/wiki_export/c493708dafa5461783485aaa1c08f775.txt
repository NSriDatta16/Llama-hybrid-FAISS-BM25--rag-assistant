There was insufficient support in the Convention to have the option of economic union with the US placed on the 1948 referendum ballot, Crummey and other EUP members called for a vote for responsible government in opposition to Joey Smallwood and his Confederate Association. With the results of the first referendum being inconclusive, a second round of balloting was held and Newfoundland joined Canadian Confederation.
