NGC 1128 is a dumbbell galaxy in the Abell 400 galaxy cluster. At the center of the galaxy is 3C 75, a radio source, and contains two orbiting supermassive black holes that may be merging. Computer simulations indicate that these two black holes will gradually spiral in toward each other until they merge. Lewis Swift is credited with the discovery of NGC 1128 in 1886.
