Big Girl's Blouse was an Australian skit program that aired in the mid-1990s on the Seven Network. The show was created by Gina Riley, Jane Turner and Magda Szubanski who all went on to star in Kath & Kim and the characters Kath, Kim and Sharon all feature together in several sketches on the show. There were four one-hour episodes, plus the pilot, which are usually shown as eight half-hour episodes. The phrase "Big Girl's Blouse" is a British English idiom meaning "ineffectual or weak, someone failing to show masculine strength or determination." Many of the sketches from it are still available on YouTube. This was the third sketch show created by Riley, Turner and Szubanski following "Fast Forward" and "Something Stupid".
