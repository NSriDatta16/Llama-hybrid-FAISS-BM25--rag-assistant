History 
Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium was established in 1992 and replaced Pindi Club Ground as an international stadium. It is the home ground of Islamabad United and Northern. Before the construction of Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi Club Cricket Ground had been used as a venue for international matches, including one Test match against New Zealand that was held in March 1965.

Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium was a prime spot in the 1995–96 Cricket World Cup. With an eye on the World Cup of 1996, unveiled another new Test venue for the second Test against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi. Karachi staged Pakistan's first Test match and Rawalpindi Cricket stadium became the country's 14th Test ground. The flood lights were added in late 2001 when the Australians were set to tour the Region. The stadium is just 20 minutes from the capital Islamabad and is the only international cricket stadium in the Islamabad Capital territory.

This stadium is the home ground and international debut ground of world's fastest bowler Shoaib Akhtar who is called with the nickname of Rawalpindi Express.

In the 2nd ODI of 2004 Samsung ODI series, while other Indian batters are getting struggling with the pace and spin attack of Pakistan, Sachin Tendulkar played a courageous knock of 141 (135) in this ground.
