Are You Ready is the second and the final album by Australian girl duo Shakaya, released on 5 March 2006 by Columbia Records. It was produced by Billy Mann and Christopher Rojas and features urban R&B songs—written by Shakaya themselves and Audius Mtawarira, Daniel O'Donoghue, Ruth-Anne Cunningham and Jonathan Davis. Sales of the album in Australia did not match those of their first album Shakaya (2002), and the singles "Are You Ready" and "We Ain't Goin' Down" were not major hits. It is the final album from the group, as they disbanded later in the year.
