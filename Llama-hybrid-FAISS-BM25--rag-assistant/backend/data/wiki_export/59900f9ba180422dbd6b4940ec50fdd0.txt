Title
The album shares its title with a 1973 oil painting by Carl Barks which depicts Scrooge McDuck in his money bin telling a story to Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Donald Duck. The reference is to the Yukon town of Whitehorse and Scrooge's many adventures searching for gold in the region, as told in the story Back to the Klondike.
