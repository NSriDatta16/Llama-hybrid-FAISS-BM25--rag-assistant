Airport (also known as Newcastle Airport) is a Tyne and Wear Metro station, serving Newcastle International Airport, Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear, England. It joined the network as a terminus station on 17 November 1991, following the opening of the extension from Bank Foot to Airport.

History
The majority of the route was already in place, with the alignment having been formerly served by the Ponteland and Darras Hall branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The line opened in June 1905, closing to passenger services in June 1929, with goods services operating in to the late 1960s. The Airport branch only required the construction of a short distance (around ) of new right-of-way.

During the construction of the line, a dedicated bus service operated between Bank Foot and Newcastle International Airport.

In 2014, a survey conducted by the Consumers Association found that the Tyne and Wear Metro service from the Airport was one of the highest rated airport rail links in the country for customer satisfaction â€“ scoring 85%. Only the rail link serving Birmingham International Airport was rated higher.
