Éric Millot (12 December 1968) is a French former competitive figure skater. He is the 1993 European bronze medalist, the 1995–96 Champions Series Final bronze medalist, and a four-time (1990–93) French national champion. He represented France at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, where he placed 15th, and at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, where he placed 7th.  He is also the first skater to land a triple loop-triple loop combination in competition. With wife Valerie and young daughter, the Millot family moved to California (Palm Springs and then San Diego) in the late 1990s.  While in San Diego, Millot skated with Sea World summer nights skating show and coached at local rinks.  His son was born in 2006.
