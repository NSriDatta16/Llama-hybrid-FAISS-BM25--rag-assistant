A professional from 1997 until 2014, he competed for Bellator MMA, the UFC, Affliction, Jungle Fight, and is the former IFL light heavyweight champion, where he was a member of Ken Yasuda's Tokyo Sabres.

Wrestling career

At 90 kg, he won a silver medal in the 1994 European championships, and placed 11th in the 1994 World Championships. He utilized his wrestling background extensively in his fights.

Their first impression of him had been when he was cleaning the mats in poor-looking clothing.

He was also a two-time National Junior College champion at Lassen College, winning the 177–184 lb weight class in 1996 and the heavyweight weight class in 1997, before moving on to the University of Nevada, graduating with a degree in Health Science in 1999.
