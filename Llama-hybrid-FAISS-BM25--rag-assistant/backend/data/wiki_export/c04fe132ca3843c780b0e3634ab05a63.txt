History
Before the foundation of the current club, two active clubs in the South-West division were playing that as Knockavilla and Innishannon. Richard Barret, commonly known as "Dick Barret" was a secretary of Knockavilla and was the principal of the local primary school. He was executed on 8 December 1922 during the Irish Civil War, and a "Dick Barret memorial shield" is contested as an U15 competition, where the semi-final is held In Innishannon and the final is then held at Oliver Plunketts GAA.

Before the foundation of the current Valley Rovers club, another local club reached the county minor football finals three times in at row between 1915 and 1917. They won in 1916. During this Knockavilla played the 1915 Cork Junior Football Final in 1915 and beat South-East outfit Shamrocks 1-04 to 1-00 and then lost to Carrigtwohill 1-02 to 1-00 in the Cork Junior Hurling Final in the same year. They once again got to the football county final but lost to Midleton 5-02 to 0-00. 

In 1930, Valley Rovers reached the South-West Hurling final, losing to Clonakilty who eventually went on to win the county final.

In 2008, the club claimed the Cork County intermediate football title. Wins against Aghabullogue, Macroom (after a replay) and Ballydesmond set up a final meeting with Kildorrery. This final was played in Páirc Uí Rinn and the team won on a scoreline of 1–12 to 3–4. The year was capped by victory in the Division 3 league final over Ballinora.

Ladies football
The adult section of the ladies football club was created in 1995, followed by a junior section in 1999, which won the U14 C County in their first year. The club competes in both the West Cork League and County championship. The adult team won a Junior B title in 2008 and an U21B title in 2009. An U16 county title was won in 2009. A new grading system was brought in for 2010 with the Junior A Championship being regraded as Intermediate.
