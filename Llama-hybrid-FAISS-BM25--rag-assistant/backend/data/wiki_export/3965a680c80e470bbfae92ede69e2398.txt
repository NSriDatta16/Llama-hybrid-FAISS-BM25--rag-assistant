Schlieren (Zürich German Schlierä) is a municipality in the district of Dietikon in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

History 

The oldest artifact discovered in the Canton of Zürich is a Stone Age Neanderthal hand axe which was found in Schlieren, and dates back to approximately 100,000 BCE.

Until 1415, Schlieren belonged to Habsburg. After the conquest of Aargau by the Swiss Confederates it was a component of the county of Baden. In 1803 Schlieren was assigned to the Canton of Zürich. In 1777 the minister Heinrich Keller created here the first "deaf-mute school" in Switzerland. Thanks to the proximity to the city of Zürich and the good traffic facilities (Tram, S-Bahn), Schlieren showed a population growth of 10,000 since the 1930s.

Schlieren was considered for inclusion of the expansion of Zurich's city limits, but was ultimately not part of the expansion of 1934.

The, now under construction, Limmattal light rail line will follow a similar alignment, from Zürich Altstetten railway station to Killwangen, and Zürich tram route 2 will be extended to Schlieren to replace the trolleybus.
