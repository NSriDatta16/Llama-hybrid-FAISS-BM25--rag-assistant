History 
Phagwara started as a market town in the region, founded by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It eventually grew into a more rural character.  In 1772 it became part of the Ahluwalia Sikh Dynasty of Kapurthala. A decade earlier, the militarist Sikh Guru Hargobind Sahib ji visited the city in 1635 near the end of his time as Sikh guru. One of his great devotees, Phagu, heard that Sahib was fighting the Mughals and coming to his city. He eventually left in shock, betraying his guru. Reacting to the situation, Sahib ji once said ‘Phagu Da Warra, Bahron Mitha Andra Khara’. Thus, Phagwara’s name originally comes from that phrase.
