The Riverside Discovery Center, formerly named the Riverside Park and Zoo, is a park and zoo complex along the North Platte River in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, United States.

Riverside Park is Scottsbluff's city park, and has the only zoo in western Nebraska. It includes three lakes with camping and recreation areas, and a riverside trail that runs along the banks of the North Platte River.  There are also over 30 garden spots.
December 16, 2017 two brother grizzly bears went on exhibit. In the spring of 2017 their mother was illegally killed in Wyoming.  State and Federal wildlife officials hoped the two orphaned cubs would survive in the wild without their mother.   After several months on their own in the wild, the two cubs became increasingly habituated to humans for food.  State and Federal wildlife officials were concerned about public safety and the well-being of the grizzly cubs.  When it was evident the cubs were not going to survive in the wild on their own, State and Federal wildlife officials made the decision to capture the two cubs and try to find them a home.  Riverside Discovery Center offered to assist in the rescue of the two cubs and to provide a new home for these two grizzly bear cubs.

Riverside Discovery Center was directly in the path of the August 21, 2017 total eclipse.

Riverside discovery center was not re-accredited by the AZA in September 2023.
