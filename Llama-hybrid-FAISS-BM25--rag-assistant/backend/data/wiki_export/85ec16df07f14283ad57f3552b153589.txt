The Australian Entertainment Mo Awards (commonly known informally as the Mo Awards) were an annual Australian entertainment industry award, that where established in 1975, to recognise achievements in live entertainment in Australia. They were last awarded in 2016.

Lucky Grills, actor and comedian  came up with the idea to create an awards show to celebrate Australian Variety, during a meeting in 1975.

The Mo Awards, initially were founded as the Star Awards and were a state honour in New South Wales only, local entertainers started the awards to promote the live entertainment industry in  New South Wales.

Johnny O'Keefe became chairman in 1976, and decided the awards should become an Australia-wide national awards program. Entertainer Don Lane then proposed the awards be renamed the Mo Awards in honour of Australian comedian and vaudevillian Roy Rene, who was famous for the character "Mo McCackie."

Categories

The award categories were reviewed annually and adapted to new trends in the Australian entertainment sector; categories included awards in: musical theatre, opera, Classical music, dance, comedy, rock music, jazz, country music, plays and variety shows.
