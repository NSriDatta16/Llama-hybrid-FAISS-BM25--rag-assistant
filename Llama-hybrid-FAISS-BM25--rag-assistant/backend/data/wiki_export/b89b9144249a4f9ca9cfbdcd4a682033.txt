DSP-4, or N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine, is a neurotoxin selective for noradrenergic neurons, capable of crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier.

It exerts transient effects in peripheral sympathetic neurons, but more permanent changes within neurons of the central nervous system. It can induce long-term depletion in cortical and spinal levels of noradrenaline.
