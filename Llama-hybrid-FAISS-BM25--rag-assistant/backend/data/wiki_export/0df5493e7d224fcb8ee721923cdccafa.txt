California's 1st congressional district is a U.S. congressional district in California. Doug LaMalfa, a Republican, has represented the district since January 2013. Currently, it encompasses the northeastern part of the state. Since the 2022 election, it includes the counties of Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Shasta, Siskiyou, Sutter, and Tehama, and most of Yuba County. The largest cities in the district are Chico, Redding, and Yuba City.

Prior to redistricting in 2021, it included Butte County, Lassen County, Modoc County, Plumas County, Shasta County, Sierra County, Siskiyou County, Tehama County, most of Nevada County, part of Glenn County and part of Placer County. In the 2021 redistricting, it added the Yuba-Sutter area and removed most of its share of the Sierra Nevada.

Competitiveness 
Prior to 2013, the GOP last held the seat in 1998 when U.S. Representative Frank Riggs decided to run for the U.S. Senate. Riggs was replaced by long-time Democratic Assemblyman and State Senator Mike Thompson. Redistricting in 2001 added Democratic-leaning areas of Yolo County.

John Kerry won the district in 2004 presidential election with 59.7% of the vote. Barack Obama carried the district in 2008 presidential election with 65.60% of the vote. The redistricting after the 2010 census made the district much more Republican-leaning; Mitt Romney and Donald Trump won the district by double digits in 2012, 2016, and 2020 respectively.
