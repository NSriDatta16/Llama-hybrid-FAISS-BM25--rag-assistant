Career
At age 12, Funayama began curling in her hometown Tokoro, Hokkaido, joining Akiko Katoh's junior team together with Ayumi Ogasawara (then Onodera). Funayama mainly played third for the Katoh team. The team represented Japan at four World Junior Curling Championships (1996, 1997, 1998 & 1999), winning a silver medal in 1998 and another silver in 1999. The team later represented Japan at the 2002 Winter Olympics, finishing in 8th place with a 2–7 record.

After the 2001-2002 season, Funayama moved from Hokkaido to Aomori and formed a new team with her then-teammate Ayumi Ogasawara (then Onodera), who became the skip of the new team. The team represented Japan at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where Funayama played third and Japan finished 7th with a 4–5 record, including a surprise win over one of the usual curling powerhouses, Canada. After the 2005-2006 season, Funayama and Ogasawara announced their temporary retirement. Funayama got married and had a child before returning to the sport in the 2011-12 season.

In 2011, Funayama and Ogasawara formed a new team in Sapporo, Hokkaido. The team qualified for the 2014 Winter Olympics through the Olympic Qualification Event 2013.
