Music video

There was a music video made for the song "Best Kept Secret". It was the first video by the band to have a story of some kind in it, though the story is very brief. Some of the video shows the band in the story portion in futuristic clothing, while the rest of it shows them playing in a room in similar clothing. The story portion shows the band entering a hallway, which they walk along until they come to a massive room where prisoners are being held in glass cells. All of the prisoners appear to be asleep, with gas masks over their faces. Each band member takes a pipe, at which point all of the prisoners wake up, and the band then smashes the glass of the cells. All of the prisoners fall out of the cells and onto the floor. The band helps them all up as they remove their masks. After freeing the prisoners, the band exits the way they came in.

Chart performance

In 2000, Invincible peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart.
