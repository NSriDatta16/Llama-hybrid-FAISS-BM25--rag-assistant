Brisbane Linked Intersection Signal System or BLISS was Brisbane City Council's ITS infrastructure platform.  This system incorporates large scale Traffic Signal control, a Real Time Passenger Information System (RAPID), and other infrastructure for managing and monitoring the road network for the Greater Brisbane Area.

For many years Brisbane City Council was very progressive amongst local governments in development and implementation of ITS solutions, and BLISS is one of the results of these endeavours.

History
The BLISS project began in the mid-1980s to replace separate legacy systems for traffic signal coordination within the city, and pioneered the use of local co-ordination modules integrated with, or connected to the traffic signal controller in the field.

BLISS was previously used in Brisbane to control approximately 900 sets of traffic signals throughout the city.  It is also used in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
