Sungai Siput (U) (Jawi: سوڠاي سيڤوت; Tamil: சுங்கை சீப்புட்; Chinese: 和豐市/和丰市) (English: Snail River) is a town and mukim in Kuala Kangsar District, Perak, Malaysia, covering 155.141 hectares, 61.5% of the total area of Kuala Kangsar. Sungai Siput falls under the management of the Kuala Kangsar Municipal Council.

History 
The earliest settlement in Sungai Siput was situated at Pelang, about 2 kilometres from the current town. The settlement was populated by villagers of Minangkabau origins who had earlier settled in Sayong. The settlers were from the family of Malik and the son Tuyub, which family tomb is still visible from the roadside situated in the estate in front of the Rimba Panjang new village. One of the descendants was the late Imam Jusuh, one of the first imams of the Alghufraniah Sungai Siput Mosque and the town councillor. Sister Enson was a well-known traditional healer. One of the surviving siblings is Associate Professor Suhaimi Bin Saidin, a lecturer at Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah in Kuala Kangsar. With the arrival of British planters and tin miners in the early 1850s the focus of activity moved to the present Sungai Siput town.

Sungai Siput is notable for the incident that triggered the start of the Malayan Emergency. The Malayan colonial administration declared a state of emergency on 16 June 1948 after members of the Communist Party of Malaya killed three European plantation managers at a plantation office twenty miles east of Sungai Siput town. The CPM was subsequently banned in July. Many Singaporean historians and anti-communists allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin Peng claims he had no prior knowledge. In fact, he says he was so unprepared for the start of hostility that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and lost touch with the party for a couple of days.

Li Weilun, an Esperanto professor at the Beijing Language and Culture University, was born in Sungai Siput in 1936.
