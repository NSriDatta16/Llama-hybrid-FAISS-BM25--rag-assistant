History

The parish of Torvestad was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 February 1855 the village of Haugesund was declared a "ladested" (port of lading) and it was separated from Torvastad to form a municipality of its own. The split left Torvastad with 3,242 inhabitants.  On 1 November 1881, most of the mainland part of Torvastad was separated to form the new municipality of Skaare.  This left Torvastad with 1,918 residents. The island of Utsira was separated from Torvastad on 1 July 1924 to form the new municipality of Utsira.  After the split, Torvastad was left with 2,187 residents.
