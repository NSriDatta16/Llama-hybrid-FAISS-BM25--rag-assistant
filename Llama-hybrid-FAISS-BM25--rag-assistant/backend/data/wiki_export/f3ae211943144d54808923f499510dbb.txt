Newbiggin is a village and civil parish in Bishopdale, a side dale on the south side of Wensleydale, in the Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire, England.  The population was estimated at 80 in 2012.

The name Newbiggin derived from the words 'niwe', which is Old English for 'new' and 'bigging', a word from Middle English, said to mean 'building'. This translates to New Building in today's language.

History
Newbiggin once belonged to Jervaulx Abbey.

Newbiggin is home to a number of 18th-century houses, one of the more notable ones is in the north end of the parish. This house in particular has a doorway which is said to have: "a cambered lintel with a quatrefoil in each angle and moulded jambs". Above this door there is an inscription dated 1636. This dates the house back almost 400 years now, and some of its key features such as its original three light mullioned window still remains to this day.

Furthermore, there was once a school, named 'The Free School' in Newbiggin which was founded by Elizabeth Withay in the year 1748. This was endowed with 3 acres of land, and rented at £7 a year. This would equate to around £596.12 in 2005.

On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village. It was also the location for the first intermediate stage sprint, at the  point, won by Jens Voigt of Trek Factory Racing.

Governance 
Newbiggin was a township of the ancient parish of Aysgarth, and became a separate civil parish in 1866. It now shares a grouped parish council, the Aysgarth & District Parish Council, with Aysgarth, Bishopdale, Thoralby and Thornton Rust.
