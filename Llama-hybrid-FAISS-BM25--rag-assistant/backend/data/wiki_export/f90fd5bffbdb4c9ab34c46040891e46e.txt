Drogheda MacBride railway station () serves Drogheda in County Louth, Ireland.

Description
The present station is located on a sharp curve on the southern approach to the Boyne Viaduct.  Formerly there were three lines through the station between the 'up' and 'down' platforms, but when the station was refurbished in 1997, the up platform line was removed and the platform widened.

It was given the name MacBride on Sunday 10 April 1966 in commemoration of John MacBride, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916.

History
The original Drogheda station, on the Dublin and Drogheda Railway line, opened on 26 May 1844. It was originally located about a quarter mile southeast of the current station. The passenger station was resited when the first temporary Boyne Viaduct opened on 11 May 1853.

The former GNR(I) branch to Oldcastle (opened to Navan in 1850; throughout 1863) diverges from the Dublin-Belfast mainline immediately south of the station.
This serves Irish Cement at Drogheda and Tara Mine near Navan.
