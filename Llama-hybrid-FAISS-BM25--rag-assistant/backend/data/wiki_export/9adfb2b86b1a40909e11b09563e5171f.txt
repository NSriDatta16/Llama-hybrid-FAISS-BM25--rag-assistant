The Miss Alaska competition is a scholarship pageant that selects the representative for the state of Alaska in the Miss America pageant. Unlike most state-level pageants in the Miss America system, Alaska allows any eligible woman to enter the Miss Alaska pageant without first having to win a local qualifying pageant. 

Jessica Reisinger of Anchorage was crowned Miss Alaska 2022 on June 16, 2022, at the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts in Anchorage, Alaska. She represented Alaska and competed the title for Miss America 2023 at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut in December 2022 where she was Women in STEM Finalist.
