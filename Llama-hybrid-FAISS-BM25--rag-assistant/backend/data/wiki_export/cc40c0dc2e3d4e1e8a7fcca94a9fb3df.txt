Awn Al-Sharif Qasim () (June 16, 1933 – January 19, 2006) was a prolific Sudanese writer, encyclopedist, scholar, community leader, and one of Sudan's leading experts on Arabic language and literature.

He was a strong advocate of Arabic/Islamic culture and its interweaving with Sudanese culture. Qasim authored more than 70 books in the area of Islamic history and civilization, Arabic literature, studies in the Sudanese dialect languages.

Along with Professor Abdalla Eltayeb and Professor Abu Saleem, Qasim was considered one of the scholars who shaped the Sudanese academic scene during the last three decades of the 20th century.

Early life and education 

Qasim was born in Sudan's ancient city Halfayat Almilook in 1933.  His father immigrated to Sudan from Yemen in 1925 and settled in the city of Halfayat Almilook in Khartoum North and became a known religious figure in the area teaching and educating on Islamic sciences.  Due to this background, Qasim was exposed to a heritage of Islamic and Arabic culture education since his early childhood that later on shaped his life.

He graduated from the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Khartoum in 1957.  He earned his master's degree in 1960, majoring in Arabic and Islamic studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London.  In 1967, he earned his PhD from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.

Career 
Qasim served as a minister of religious affairs for 10 years (1971-1981) the longest period served by a minister in all Sudanese governments.  During this period he demonstrated exceptional qualities as a leader and political religious figure and soon became one of the most  popular and beloved ministers in Sudan's 1970s government for his strong work ethics, humbleness and honesty.  He was able to connect with different religious groups and to promote ideas of peace and harmony among these groups.  Qasim continued to write during this period and published dozens of books for the public. After the military coup by Omer Al Bashir, he was arrested along with other ministers from Nimeiri's government.

Writings 
In the mid-1990s, he authored the Sudanese Encyclopedia of Tribes and Genealogies, a pioneer, state of the art series of books for the different Sudanese tribes, their roots and origins.  This project has entitled him to earn Az-Zubair Prize for Innovation and Scientific Excellence, the highest prestigious prize awarded by Sudanese government.  He was also awarded the Egyptian prestigious First Class Golden Award for scientific achievements in 1992 by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak.
