Career
William Milligan Sloane was born in Richmond, Ohio on November 12, 1850. He graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society, in 1868, and afterward was employed as instructor in classics at the Newell School in Pittsburgh until 1872. From 1872 to 1876 he studied at the universities of Berlin and Leipzig. He studied history under Mommsen and Droysen, and much of the time he worked as private secretary to George Bancroft, United States Minister at Berlin. He received a doctorate from the University of Leipzig, with a dissertation entitled The Poet Labid: His Life, Times, and Fragmentary Writings, which was published in 1877. The published version of Sloane's dissertation specifically mentions that he studied under Fleischer, Krehl, and  at Leipzig.

Sloane was a professor of Latin (1877–1883) and subsequently History (1883–1896) at Princeton University, when it was still known as the College of New Jersey. While there, he edited the Princeton Review (1885–1888). He resigned in 1896 to become Seth Low Professor of History at Columbia University.
