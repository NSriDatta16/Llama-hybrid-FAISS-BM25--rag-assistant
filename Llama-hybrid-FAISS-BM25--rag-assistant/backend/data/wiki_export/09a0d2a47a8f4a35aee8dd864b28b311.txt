Word Up! Magazine was a popular teen entertainment magazine which debuted in August 1987.

Word Up! stood out from other publications of its kind due to its emphasis on hip-hop music and rap artists, including artists that had not yet made it into the mainstream. 

The magazine was name-checked by The Notorious B.I.G. in his 1994 hit song "Juicy": "It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up! magazine." The magazine headquarters is located in Queens, NY and is published by Cynthia Horner, CEO of Right On! Media Holdings, LLC., who was one of the founding editors and first editor-in-chief of Hip Hop Weekly. The chief photographer is Kenneth Harris aka KENTHEPHOTOGRAPHER who has been honored on numerous occasions for his historical photos of such artists as LL Cool J., Run-DMC, and numerous contemporary recording artists.
