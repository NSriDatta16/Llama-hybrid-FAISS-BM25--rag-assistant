Bury Interchange is a transport hub in the town of Bury, Greater Manchester, England. Opened in 1980, it is the northern terminus of the Manchester Metrolink's Bury Line, which prior to 1992 was a heavy-rail line. It also incorporates a bus station.

History
Bury Interchange was opened by British Rail in March 1980, integrating a new bus station with the northern terminus of the Bury-to-Manchester heavy railway line, a new short spur line was constructed to connect the new station. The railway had originally run into Bury Bolton Street which was further away from the town centre, and was closed by British Rail on the same day that Bury Interchange opened; Bury Bolton Street is now operated by the heritage East Lancashire Railway. The railway was redeveloped in the early-1990s to become part of the Manchester Metrolink network in 1992, forming the northern terminus. The interchange is managed by Transport for Greater Manchester and has recently been refurbished, improving facilities and security for passengers.
