"Koi no Cute Beat"/"Mister U.S.A." is the debut single from the Super Monkey's released under the Toshiba-EMI label. It is the only single by the group to be released under their original moniker. Three months after the release, their eldest member, Anna Makino, left the group.

Music video
Although fans had copies of the music videos for the group's final three singles, the existence of music videos for the group's earliest singles were unquestionable until a low quality digital rip of "Mister U.S.A." surfaced on the internet from a Japanese website serving video files related to the group, MAX.

The music video appears to have been shot almost entirely in bluescreen except for one scene where the group performs a dance routine together. The remaining scenes of the video portrays the members of the group around the world in such locations as China and Egypt.

Live performances and other usages
Namie Amuro first appeared on Downtown's Hey!Hey!Hey! Music Champ in March 1995. However, her first on-air meeting with the comedic duo was during one of their earlier TV programs in 1992 where she performed "Mister U.S.A." with the rest of the group.
"Koi no Cute Beat" was featured as the ending theme to the variety program, Kuizu Sekai wa Show by Shobbai!! and "Mister U.S.A." was used in a commercial for Lotte cereal ice. The group showed in the commercials in what was their first major endorsement deal. They would go on to do subsequent commercials for the company.
