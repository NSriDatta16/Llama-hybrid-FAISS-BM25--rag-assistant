The Socorro Independent School District (SISD) serves more than 47,000 students in 49 schools and is the second largest school district in El Paso, Texas. The district covers 135 square miles serving East El Paso, Horizon City and the City of Socorro. SISD is well known as a destination district for its high-quality instruction, innovative programs, and a supportive and united community. The district operates on a year-round calendar from July to May with a fall and spring intersession.

History
In 1961, the residents of Socorro voted 63-0 for the formation of the Socorro Independent School District. At the time, Escontrias Elementary School was the only campus in the area for students. High school students attended Clint High School or Ysleta High School.

It wasn't until 1964 that the district built its first high school, Socorro High School. Socorro High School would house about 2,800 students for 40 years. The district's board of trustees decided that they needed another high school. In 1990, Montwood High School was built. The district built its football stadium, the SISD Student Activities Complex, in 1991. These two schools would begin an annual rivalry in football, in which the winner takes home the "Helmet"; a football helmet with a red side to represent Socorro, and a green side to represent Montwood. Montwood would serve about 3,000 students, when again, the board decided they needed a new school. Americas High School was built in 1996 and serves about 3,000 students.

The next addition to SISD was El Dorado High School. The first senior class graduated in 2007. Eastlake High School joined the district in August 2010, in unincorporated El Paso County adjoining Horizon City. The newest additions to the Socorro Independent School District for the 2015-2016 school year were Purple Heart Elementary School and Pebble Hills High School.

In 2022 the district opened magnet programs, with one specializing in fine arts at Paso Del Norte Elementary School, and one at Escontrias Elementary School specializing in STEAM fields.

In 2022 Nate Carman became the superintendent.
