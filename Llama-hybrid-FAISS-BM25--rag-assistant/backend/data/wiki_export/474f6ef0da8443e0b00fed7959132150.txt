DHA-clozapine (tentative trade name Clozaprexin) is an atypical antipsychotic drug candidate that was created and originally tested by chemists at Protarga, a small pharmaceutical in Pennsylvania, and scientists at Harvard University.   

It is a prodrug of  clozapine; the fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was added to clozapine in order to increase penetration of the bloodâ€“brain barrier. 

Protarga was purchased by Luitpold Pharmaceuticals in 2003 and development was discontinued in 2007.
