A paragraphos (, , from , 'beside', and , 'to write') was a mark in ancient Greek punctuation, marking a division in a text (as between speakers in a dialogue or drama) or drawing the reader's attention to another division mark, such as the two dot punctuation mark .

There are many variants of this symbol, sometimes supposed to have developed from Greek gamma (), the first letter of the word . It was usually placed at the beginning of a line and trailing a little way under or over the text.

It was referenced by Aristotle, who was dismissive of its use.
