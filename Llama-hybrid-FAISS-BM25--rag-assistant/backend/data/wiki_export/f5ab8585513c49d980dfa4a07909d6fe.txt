Critical reception

The St. Petersburg Times wrote: "The Outfield specializes in what you could call an early '80s American Sound... It's music by recipe: You take hyper-macho hard rock and tone it down so it will appeal to the over-17 set." USA Today called the band a "middleweight, pop-rock group." The Los Angeles Times deemed them "nice, clean Anglo popsters with plenty of teeth in their smiles but none in their music." Newsday opined that some songs "make Bon Jovi sound like innovators, make the Starship seem like a band on the cutting edge."
