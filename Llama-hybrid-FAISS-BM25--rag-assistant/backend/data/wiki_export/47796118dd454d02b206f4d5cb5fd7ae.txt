Toys That Kill is a San Pedro-based punk rock band, formed from a previous incarnation known as F.Y.P. (1989â€“1999). Just after the release of the last F.Y.P. album, also titled Toys That Kill, Todd Congelliere and Sean Cole (vocalists/guitarists) along with new members Chachi Ferrara (bass) and Denis Fleps (drums) got together to form the new band.

They have toured Japan once, Europe twice and the U.S. once or twice a year since the year 2000. Congelliere, Ferrara, and Felix all play together in Underground Railroad to Candyland, another Recess Records act.
