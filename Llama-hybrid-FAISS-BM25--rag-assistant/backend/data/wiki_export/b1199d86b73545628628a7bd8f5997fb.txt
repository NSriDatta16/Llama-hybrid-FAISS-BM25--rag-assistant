HJRFC has roots going as far back as 1904 with the formation of the Hillhead Sports Club, however, the rugby club as we know it today was founded in 1988 with a Women's section added in 1995, they have played at their current home ground, Hughenden in the West End of Glasgow since then. Despite their name, the club is not located in either Hillhead or Jordanhill, although the pre-merger clubs did have historical links with these areas.

History
The club was formed by the merger of Jordanhill Rugby Football Club (the rugby club of Jordanhill College) and Hillhead Rugby Football Club in 1988.

Jordanhill Rugby Football Club was founded as a club for the students and former students of Jordanhill College, Glasgow in 1921.

Hillhead Rugby Football Club has its roots in Hillhead Sports Club, founded in 1902 as a private club for former pupils of Hillhead High School, Glasgow, catering for various sports including football, cricket, hockey and athletics. A rugby team, Hillhead High School Former Pupils RFC (later Hillhead RFC), was formed in 1904. Initially the club used the Scotstoun Showgrounds before seeking to find a permanent home after the First World War, purchasing land at Hughenden in 1922. The club's new home, with its pavilion designed by W. Hunter McNab, was officially opened on 24 May 1924. Since then Hughenden has hosted a variety of sports including hockey, cricket and tennis, although it has been most closely associated with rugby. The first major sports tournament held at the club was the West of Scotland Tennis Championship in 1925. Due to the growing popularity of the rugby team, a grandstand was built alongside the pitch in 1934, designed by local consulting engineers FA MacDonald. The stand was built of reinforced concrete with a cantilevered roof, unusual for the time. It was first used in September 1934, for a match between Hillhead and Glasgow Academicals. In 1969, the clause restricting entry to the club to former students of Hillhead High School is removed to allow better recruitment and the club formerly becomes Hillhead RFC. The ground had an upgrade of their floodlights in 1977.

The culmination of season 2009–10 saw the club win the Scottish Premiership Division Three championship. The following season the club consolidated their position back in Scottish Premiership Division Two with a new coaching team made up of Grant Sweenie and Colin Dickson as joint head coaches. The 2nd XV under Gareth Morris and Stuart Torbet had a strong season ending with promotion to the top reserve league. Season 2011–12 saw a change to the coaching team with Grant Sweenie stepping down due to work commitments and another former Hills player, Derek Busby, taking over as head coach assisted by Colin Dickson. The 2nd XV also saw a change in coaching personnel with Gareth Morris stepping down due to work commitments with the new coaching team comprising club stalwarts Stuart Torbet and Murray Bell.
