The Financial Supervision Commission (FSC) () was the financial regulator of the Isle of Man.

The commission was established in 1983.  The Chairman was previously a Member of Tynwald until legislation forbade this in 2004.

In 2015, the FSC merged with the Insurance and Pensions Authority (IPA) to form the Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA).
