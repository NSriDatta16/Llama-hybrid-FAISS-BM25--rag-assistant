Undermind is a 2003 psychological thriller film written and directed by Nevil Dwek and starring Sam Trammell, Erik Jensen, and Susan May Pratt.

Plot
Derrick, a corporate lawyer with a large trust fund, and Zane, a criminal, live in opposite social spheres. Although they have never meet, their lives are more connected than either one of them could ever imagine. One morning, the privileged Derrick wakes up in a different apartment, in bed with a woman he has never seen before. It's clear that she knows him, but she calls him Zane, and so does everybody else. Derrick finds himself living Zane's criminal life, where people strangely resemble those in his real life. Meanwhile, Zane has also entered a parallel world and must now grapple with Derrick's life. He is seduced by Derrick's privileged world of money and power, as he begins to contend with Derrick's demons. He yearns to return and improve his own life, but is completely powerless to do so. As Derrick and Zane make their way through the life of the other, they start to reshape their new worlds, in which they discover inner strengths that neither knew he possessed.
