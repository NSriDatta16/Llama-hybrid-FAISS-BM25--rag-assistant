Geography
Libice nad Cidlinou is located about  southeast of Nymburk and  east of Prague. It lies in the Central Elbe Table lowland within the Polabí region. The village is situated on the right bank of the Cidlina River, near its confluence with the Elbe.

History

According to pottery finds, a Slavic settlement was established here in the 6th century. Libice emerged in the 9th century as the capital gord of the Slavník family. The first written mention of Libice is from 981 and relates to a mention from the Chronica Boemorum.

In 995, Libice was stormed by Bohemian Duke Boleslaus II (Přemyslid) and the Vršovci clan, who killed most of the Slavník family and annexed Libice to Prague. Adalbert of Prague and his brother, Archbishop Radim Gaudentius, survived by taking refuge in land of the Polans under rule of Boleslaus II.

In the 11th century, the gord survived and continued to function as an important administrative centre of Bohemia. In 1108, Božej of the Vršovci family lived here as a castellan. In 1130, Libice was destroyed by a large fire. The village was renewed, but the gord disappeared, and the stones from it served as building material for the villagers. According to deeds from 1228 and 1233, the village was then owned by the St. George's Convent in Prague. In 1336, the convent sold Libice to Ješek of Všechlapy.
