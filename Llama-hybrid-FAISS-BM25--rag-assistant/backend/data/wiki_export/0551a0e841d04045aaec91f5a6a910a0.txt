Back Up Train is Al Green's debut album, released by Hot Line Records, a label formed by Palmer James and Curtis Rodgers, high school friends of Al Green's.  This album was released prior to signing with Hi Records and still lists his name as "Greene" (the actual correct spelling of his name). The title track was originally released in January 1967 as a single under the band name "Al Greene and The Soul Mates".

The album has been reissued, first in 1972 on Bell Records 6076 as Al Green (and a release of "Guilty" as a single, which became a Top 30 R&B hit), then in 1999 on Arista 7822-19097-2 as Al Green Master Hits.  In 2005, with Sony's acquisition of the BMG/Arista catalog, it was issued again on Legacy 82876-69548-2 as Back Up Train with the original artwork from 1967.
