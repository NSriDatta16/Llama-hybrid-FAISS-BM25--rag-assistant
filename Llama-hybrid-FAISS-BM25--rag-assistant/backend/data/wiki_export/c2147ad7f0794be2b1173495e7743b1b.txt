Closed schools
The following junior high schools were closed in a consolidation effort in 1986:

Brookside Junior High School (now used for the district offices and partially rented to other tenants).  Brookside also houses the Meadowbrook Alternative Program the district's alternate learning program, for grades 10-12, one of the few in the United States. 
Jerusalem Avenue Junior High School (now a center for Nassau BOCES)

The rental of Jerusalem Avenue to Nassau BOCES, and the rental of space in Brookside that the district doesn't use generates additional income for the district. In addition, the schools' sports programs require the use of more than one gym for practice, as there are usually two sports requiring a gym in a given season. Therefore, students from Grand Avenue will sometimes practice at Jerusalem Avenue and students at Merrick Avenue will sometime practice at Brookside.
