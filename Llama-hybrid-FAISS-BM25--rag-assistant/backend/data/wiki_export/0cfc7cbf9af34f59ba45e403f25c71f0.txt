Home media release

English
The series was originally licensed for home video release in North America by Illumitoon Entertainment in 2006, who released only two volumes on bilingual DVD in 2007. All further volumes were canceled when their distribution deal with Westlake Entertainment fell through. S'more Entertainment announced on January 16, 2012 that they would release the series with English subtitles and dubbing on DVD on April 10 of the same year. This release, however, lacked an English subtitle track, despite a fully translated script being present on a PDF file on disc 4 and indications on the box and in the pre-release information that there would be a subtitle track. S'more Entertainment released a statement claiming the packaging was wrong, and that there was never an intention to subtitle the release due to costs. In August 2018, Discotek Media announced their licensing of the series and released an SD Blu-ray disc set of all 76 episodes on January 28, 2020.
