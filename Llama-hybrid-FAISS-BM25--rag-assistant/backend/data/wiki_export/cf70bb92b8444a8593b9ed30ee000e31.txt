Anne-Marie Albiach (9 August 1937 – 4 November 2012) was a contemporary French poet and translator.

Overview
Anne-Marie Albiach's was a renowned French poet and writer born in Saint -Nazaire, France on 9 August 1937. Anne- Marie Albiach became well known with the publication of her poetry titled état in 1971. Albiach is a respected and an influential figure for her contribution to contemporary Women's poetry. Anne-Marie was known to originate her personal experiences pared down to impersonal and for deviating from traditional syntax and semantics. Albiach is also known for her famous poetry collection Mezza Voce. In the opening section of Mezza Voce, Albiach's interest in the intersecting trajectories of language and the body is articulated through discursive cadences of prose poetry characterized by, among other things, inventive use of spacing on the printed page. With Claude Royet-Journoud and Michel Couturier, she co-edited the magazine Siécle a mains, where she first published her translation of Louis Zukofsky's "A-9".

Today, Albiach is associated in France with poets Claude Royet-Journoud and Emmanuel Hocquard, all three being, at various times, translated and published by the American poets Keith Waldrop and Rosmarie Waldrop via Burning Deck, their influential small press.
