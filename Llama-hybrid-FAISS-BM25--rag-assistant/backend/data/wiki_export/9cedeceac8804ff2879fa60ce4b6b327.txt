Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club
Barisan Nasional Backbenchers Club (; abbrev: BNBBC) is composed of the BN backbencher MPs. The term "backbencher" originates from the British Parliament, denoting an MP who is not a member of the Cabinet or is otherwise part of the government as a Deputy Minister or Parliamentary Secretary. Since the 2022 general election, there have been 30 BN MPs. Six among them have been appointed as members of the Anwar Ibrahim cabinet. Therefore, there are presently 24 BN backbencher MPs. Initially it was not prominent in parliamentary affairs. However, in 2005, it drew attention when its then Chairman Shahrir Abdul Samad publicly called for the restoration of the Parliamentary Services Act (PSA) so that the Parliament could be self-sufficient in conducting its own affairs. The then backbencher MPs supported Shahrir, but little was heard further on after the matter blew over. Then in 2006, Shahrir resigned from his position after not receiving support from the backbenchers in voting for a motion brought by then Leader of the Opposition and MP for Ipoh Timor Lim Kit Siang from the Democratic Action Party (DAP). Then Deputy Chairman Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar was appointed to replace Shahrir as the Acting Chair. After 2008 general election, Bintulu MP Tiong King Sing of the Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party (SPDP) took over Raja Ahmad Zainuddin as Chairman while Kinabatangan MP Bung Moktar Radin took over as Deputy Chairman. After the 2013 general election, Shahrir was reappointed Chairman for a second term replacing Tiong and Bung Moktar remained the Deputy Chairman. After the 2018 Malaysian general election, the positions of Chairman and Deputy Chairman were vacant for two years. It was most recently chaired by former Prime Minister and former Pekan MP Najib Razak from November 2020 to his disqualification from the position after losing his parliamentary seat upon his admission to the prison in August 2022.
