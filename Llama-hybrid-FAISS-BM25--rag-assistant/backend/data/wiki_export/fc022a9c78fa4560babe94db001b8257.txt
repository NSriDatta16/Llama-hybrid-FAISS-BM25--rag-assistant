William Henry Stevenson (1 June 192426 November 2013) was a British-born Canadian author and journalist.

His 1976 book A Man Called Intrepid was about William Stephenson (no relation) and was a best-seller. It was made into a 1979 mini-series starring David Niven. Stevenson followed it in 1983 with another book, Intrepid's Last Case. He published his autobiography in 2012.

In 1976 Stevenson released the  book, 90 Minutes at Entebbe.
It was about Operation Entebbe, an operation where Israeli commandos landed at night at Entebbe Airport in Uganda and succeeded in rescuing the passengers of an airliner hi-jacked by Palestinian militants, while incurring very few casualties.  Stevenson's "instant book" was written, edited, printed and available for sale within weeks of the event it described.
