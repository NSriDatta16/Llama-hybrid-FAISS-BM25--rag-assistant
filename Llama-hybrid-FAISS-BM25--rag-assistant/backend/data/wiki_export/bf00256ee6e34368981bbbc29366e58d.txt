Aaron Sprinkle (born March 20, 1974) is an American record producer and musician from Seattle, Washington.

Career 
His career in music began in high school with a group called BellBangVilla.  BellBangVilla became Poor Old Lu and they released a number of albums (see below). Aaron Sprinkle also sang and played lead guitar in Rose Blossom Punch, and has produced albums independently. On his solo releases, he plays almost all instruments except drums. He produced dozens of records for Tooth & Nail Records between 1993 and 2016. In 2005, Sprinkle formed the band Fair with Joey Sanchez, Nick Barber, and Erick Newbill. Fair released its debut album The Best Worst-Case Scenario on Tooth & Nail Records in June 2006. He is the brother of drummer Jesse Sprinkle. Among others, Jesse played with Aaron in Poor Old Lu, was the most recent drummer of Dead Poetic, and was also an early member of Demon Hunter, whose albums Aaron has produced the majority of.
