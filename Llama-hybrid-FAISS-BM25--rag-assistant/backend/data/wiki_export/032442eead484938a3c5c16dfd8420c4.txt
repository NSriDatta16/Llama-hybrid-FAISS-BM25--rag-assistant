Warner Elvon Leighton (July 31, 1930 â€“ March 20, 2005) was an American film, sound, music, effects and supervising editor. An only child, he married Patricia Relyea in the early 1950s. He had two daughters with Patricia;  Denise was born in 1955 and Cynthia was born in 1958. He also had one Grandson, Kyler, born in 1993. Later, he married Margaret (P.J.) Webb on March 3, 1984. During the 1960s, Leighton edited many William Hanna and Joseph Barbera cartoons such as The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Atom Ant, Scooby-Doo, The Secret Squirrel Show, Jonny Quest, Hey There, It's Yogi Bear, and Space Ghost. He also edited a lot of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee cartoons such as Fantastic Four, and Doug Wildey cartoons such as Jonny Quest.

Leighton edited the film Gone in 60 Seconds. There was no official script for the film, apart from several pages outlining main dialog sequences. Much of the action/dialog was improvised and made up by the cast and crew as they went along. This caused many problems for Leighton, who never knew what footage was being dumped on him or where in the movie it belonged. In the DVD audio commentary, he described the script for the construction site portion of the main pursuit as a piece of cardboard with a circle on it. Leighton edited the films The Junkman and Deadline Auto Theft for director H. B. Halicki.

Leighton edited several television films. He edited the film C.H.O.M.P.S., The American Dreamer for actor, director, producer, and stuntman Dennis Hopper, and Wolf Lake.
