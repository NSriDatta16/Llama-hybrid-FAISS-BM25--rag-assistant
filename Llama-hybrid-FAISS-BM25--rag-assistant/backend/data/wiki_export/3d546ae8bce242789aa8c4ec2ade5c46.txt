The caste system in Goa consists of various Jātis or sub-castes found among Hindus belonging to the four varnas (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra), as well as those outside of them. A variation of the traditional Hindu caste system was also retained by the Goan Catholic community.

According to the Gazetteer of India, Union Territory: Goa, Daman and Diu, Part I which looks at Goa (published in 1979) the "chief castes" found in Goa are:

Bhraman

Many are landlords of the area and commonly identified by their surnames as Dessai in south Goa and by other surnames in north Goa (Like Rane, Prabhu, Gaonkar,Sawant ,Parab,ShetGaonkar,Dalvi,etc) which are specific to locations of Goa.

The community is considered high caste and always been local warlords with high influence in political matters. Recently they have also excelled in fields of medical, education, police force etc. The first war of liberation against the Portuguese rule was also started by Kshatriya community (Dessais of Cuncolim). Known as the Cuncolim revolt of 1583, villagers from Cuncolim killed proselytizing Roman Catholic priests and their armed escorts, who were in the process of converting villagers and desecrating Hindu temples in the region. The Rane revolt against Portuguese rule was also fought by the Kshatriya community (Ranes) of Goa.

Vani

Others

Historically outside Comunidade

kshatriya Dhangars
Dhangar, also referred as Gouly or Gavli, is the state’s only ancient pastoral community. In Goa under colonialism, the community kept away from the rest of society as they wanted to escape grazing tax and ban on Kumeri (shifting cultivation) introduced by the Portuguese Empire. Dhangar leaders claim that they had fled to remote hilly and forested areas to avoid religious persecution and religion conversion. They were not part of the Comunidade anywhere in Goa. It is claimed that throughout the Portuguese rule in Goa they were so insulated that not a single Dhangar got converted to Christianity.Their knowledge and experience about deep forests, played a major part in finding specific locations to build forts for the Maratha kingdom to flourish. A study carried out by Government of Goa in 2013 stated that the community had a unique identity,and are known for their martial prowess.

 In Goa, they are classified as Other Backward Classes category in India's system of reservation.

Other religions
In Goa, mass conversions were carried out by Portuguese Catholic missionaries from the 1510 conquest onwards. The Portuguese clergy imposed Portuguese surnames on the converts at the time of Baptism so that it would be difficult to know their original caste easily. The Portuguese authorities also suppressed untouchability among the converts and attempted to homogenize them into a single entity.

However, the converted Hindus retained a variation of their caste status based on patrilineal descent from their previous caste affiliations. The new converts were lumped into new Catholic castes. All Brahmin subcastes (Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Padyes, Daivadnyas), goldsmiths and even some rich merchants, were lumped into the Christian caste of Bamonns (Konkani: Brahmins). The converts from the Kshatriya and Vaishya Vani castes became lumped together as Chardos (Kshatriyas) and those Vaishyas who didn't become Chardos formed a new caste Gauddos. The converts from all the lower castes, as well as the previously Dalit and adivasi groups, were grouped together as  Sudirs, equivalent to Shudras. The Bamonns and  Chardoshave been traditionally seen as the high castes in the Goan Catholic caste hierarchy.
