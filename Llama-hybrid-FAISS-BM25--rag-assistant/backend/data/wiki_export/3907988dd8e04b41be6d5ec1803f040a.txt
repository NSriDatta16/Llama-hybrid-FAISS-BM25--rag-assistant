Ornithomimoides ("bird mimic-like") is a dubious genus of theropod dinosaur, from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, sometime between 70 and 66 mya) Lameta Formation of India. Two species have been identified, the type species O. mobilis and O. barasimlensis, were named by von Huene in 1932 and were described by Matley in 1933 though they are known only from isolated vertebrae. O. barasimlensis is known from five dorsal vertebrae, and O. mobilis from four smaller vertebrae, found at the same location. It is possible that, based on two reviews, published in 1999 and 2004 respectively, Ornithomimoides may have been an abelisaur, which may have measured between  and  in length.
