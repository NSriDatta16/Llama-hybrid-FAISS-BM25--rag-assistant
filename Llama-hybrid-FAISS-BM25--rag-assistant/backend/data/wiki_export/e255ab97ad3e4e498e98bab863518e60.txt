Defamation case 

On 15 August 2018 MailOnline published an article headed "EXCLUSIVE: Top Tory Peer’s appearance at Corbyn's 'hate conference' in Tunisia comes after YEARS of rubbing shoulders with Islamists, hate preachers and Holocaust deniers". This started the Corbyn wreath-laying controversy. Lord Sheikh took action against the publishers, Associated Newspapers Ltd who later accepted fault, admitted their allegations were false, and issued an apology.

Personal life 
Sheikh died on 22 September 2022, at the age of 81.

In Media 
On a podcast with Rajan Nazran, he describes that despite being born in Kenya and raised in Uganda, he holds a deep Indian identity at heart. He reflects on the mere existence of secularism in India, highlighting how the court of Akbar practised it more effectively than contemporary society. His vision encompasses a world where mutual respect transcends divisions of all kinds. Drawing inspiration from his ancestor, a unifying king, Lord Sheikh embraces the philosophy of excellence, community service, and altruism. His philanthropic efforts touch the lives of many.
