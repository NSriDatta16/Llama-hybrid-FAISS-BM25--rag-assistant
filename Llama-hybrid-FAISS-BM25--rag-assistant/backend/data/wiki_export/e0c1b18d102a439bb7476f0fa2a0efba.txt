The 46th British Academy Film Awards, given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1993, honoured the best films of 1992.

James Ivory's Howards End won the awards for Best Film and Best Actress (Emma Thompson). Robert Downey Jr. won Best Actor for his portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin while Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress were awarded to Gene Hackman (for Unforgiven) and Miranda Richardson (for Damage), respectively. Additionally, Robert Altman won Best Director for The Player.

Furthermore, The Crying Game, with no competition, received the Alexander Korda Award for the Outstanding British Film of the Year (later renamed "Outstanding British Film") of 1992, an award given in honour of Alexander Korda and a category that was revived this year after being discontinued in 1969. The film was directed by Neil Jordan, an Irishman—and with not a small amount of irony, it marked the end of one era of British cinema and the beginning of another.
