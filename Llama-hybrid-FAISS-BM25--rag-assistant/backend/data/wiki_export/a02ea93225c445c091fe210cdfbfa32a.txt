The Shibata clan (新発田氏, Shibata shi) was a Japanese clan that originated during the Heian period (12th century) of Japan. The Shibata clan of Echigo were descended from Sasaki Moritsuna, a supporter of Minamoto no Yoritomo and a son of Sasaki Hideyoshi. The Shibata later became retainers of the Nagao clan, which was under control by the famed Uesugi Kenshin. After Shibata Shigeie died during the year of 1587, the Shibata clan attempted to break away from the Uesugi. After this, the clan of Echigo became extinct, never to be seen again.
