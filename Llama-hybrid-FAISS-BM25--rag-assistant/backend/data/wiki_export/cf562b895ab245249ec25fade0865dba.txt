Music video

The video for "(Don't) Give Hate a Chance" is Jamiroquai's only computer-animated music video and pays homage to the Italian cartoon La Linea. In the video, an animated version of Jay Kay himself (resembling Mr. Linea from the aforementioned show) sings and dances as it cuts to scenes with humanoids (who also resemble the same character) make war references. It also feature the hand from said show and even animated gorillas.

To promote the release of the video, Sony BMG organised the video to be projected on a number of outdoor venues around central London, including the walls of the Chelsea Barracks military grounds and a car park in the Soho district. An alternate video released in late October, which included the ground being replaced by plants and rocks and significant changes to the final minute of the video.
