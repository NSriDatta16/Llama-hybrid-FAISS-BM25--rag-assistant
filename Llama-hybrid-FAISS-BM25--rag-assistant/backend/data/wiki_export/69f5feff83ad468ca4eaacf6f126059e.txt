"I Can Dream, Can't I?," is a popular song written by Sammy Fain with lyrics by Irving Kahal that was published in 1937. It was included in a flop musical, Right This Way. Tommy Dorsey released a hit recording of it the same year, but it was in the postwar years that the song gained its greatest success. Harry James recorded a version in December 1937 for Brunswick.

The best-known version was recorded by the Andrews Sisters and Gordon Jenkins Chorus and Orchestra on July 15, 1949 (Jenkins was also arranger), and released by Decca Records as catalog number 24705. It first reached the Billboard charts on September 16, 1949, peaking at number one for five weeks on all three of the magazine's main pop charts at the time (Best Sellers in Stores, Most Played by Jockeys, and Most Played in Jukeboxes)., charting well into 1950 for 25 weeks. Jenkins would top himself a few months later when he recorded " Goodnight Irene with The Weavers, the top record of 1950, selling two million copies.
