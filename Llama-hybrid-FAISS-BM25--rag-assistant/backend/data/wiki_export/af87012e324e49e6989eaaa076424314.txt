Ad Lib is a decorative typeface that was designed in 1961 by Freeman Craw for American Type Founders. It was extremely popular from the early- to mid-1960s, and is often used today to evoke that era.

The typeface is known for its square counters a-la the 60's. A SoftMaker version of this font has straighter edges for glyphs.
