The 2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series was the sixth season of the Craftsman Truck Series, the third highest stock car racing series sanctioned by NASCAR in the United States. Greg Biffle of Roush Racing was crowned the series champion.

The season was marred by the death of Tony Roper in the penultimate race of the season at Texas Motor Speedway. His death was the third of three driver fatalities across the nationwide NASCAR circuits in 2000 that included Kenny Irwin Jr. and Adam Petty.

Rookie of the Year 
Kurt Busch, winner of Roush Racing's first Gong Show, took home Rookie of the Year honors in 2000, winning four races and finishing second in points. The top runner-up was Carlos Contreras, the first Mexican to compete full-time in the Truck Series. Scott Riggs started the year with several underfunded teams, before becoming Contreras' teammate at Impact Motorsports. Rick Ware, Wayne Edwards, Kenny Martin, and Coy Gibbs all declared for ROTY but struggled in qualifying, while Mark Petty made a delayed attempt at the award. Businessman Donny Morelock and Coy's brother J. D. rounded out the rookie class of 2000.
