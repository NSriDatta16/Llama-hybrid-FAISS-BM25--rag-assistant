George Burrington (ca. 1682 â€“ 22 February 1759) was a British colonial official who served as the third and fifth governor of North Carolina from 1724 to 1725 and 1731 to 1734. He is noted for opening the lower Cape Fear region to settlement. From the outset of his administration, he encountered opposition to his authority. In 1733 he noted that African slave ships did not bring their trade to his colony.

Biography
Burrington was born in Devonshire, England. The register of Sampford Courtenay, recorded the baptism of a George Burrington on 14 November 1685. His parents were listed as John and Mary Burrington. John Burrington was the son of Gilbert Burrington. Notwithstanding his rough exterior, George Burrington seems to have been a man of education; and the sale of his books shows that he was not unprovided with literature at a time when libraries were few and scattered. His last will and testament is dated 8 December 1750. He was killed during an apparent robbery attempt in Westminster's St James's Park, 22 February 1759, and buried at St. John the Evangelist two days later.
