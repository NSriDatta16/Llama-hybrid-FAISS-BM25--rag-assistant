The river is home to various habitat including plant, bird and insect species. Its trail in Mount Kinabalu National Park is considered to be a preeminent birder's trail. The trail varies between open vistas and dense thickets, but is predominantly open, skirting the ridge-top as it goes along the north side of the river gorge. Some of the bird species include chlamydochaera jefferyi, chlorocharis emiliae emiliae, eumyias indigo cerviniventris, harpactes whiteheadi, megalaima pulcherrima, napothera crassa Luzon and zosterops atricapilla. Several insects species such as the graphelmis bandukanensis, liparthum, stalk-eyed fly (teleopsis) and myrmarachne mariaelenae also found within the river. The intensive agricultural activities in Kundasang Valley area near the upstream of the river basin however has causing problems concerning the river water quality.
