Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) () is a state corporation of Pakistan working under Ministry of Industries and Production. It was established in 1952. PIDC was created to set up industries in such fields where large capital was required and  was difficult for the private sector and to set up industries in such backward areas to creating employment opportunities. According to Yoana Barakova, a research analyst at the European Foundation for South Asian Studies, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not only expected to place Pakistan in a significant debt burden to China but also poses the risk of displacing over 10,000 people in Gilgit Baltistan from their jobs due to the substantial influx of Chinese labor.
