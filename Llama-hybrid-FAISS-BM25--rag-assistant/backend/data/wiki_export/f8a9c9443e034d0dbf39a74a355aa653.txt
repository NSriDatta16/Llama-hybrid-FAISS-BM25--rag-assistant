History 
The Edinburgh Eagles club was founded in February 1998 and were admitted to the Scottish National League that same year, finishing as runners-up after losing out to Border Raiders in the final 14–40. The following season saw the club go one better when after defeating fellow Edinburgh side Portobello Playboys in the Grand Final 48–20, they lifted the Scottish title for the first time. 

The new millennium season started early for the Eagles as they became the first Scottish club to enter the Challenge Cup at the first round stage on 4 December 1999, defeated by Woolston Rovers by only 12–17. Despite losing just one match during the regular season they were beaten by Glasgow Bulls in the Grand Final 22–47. The following season the same two sides met in the final again, Eagles winning 30–16. That victory was the start of a hat-trick of triumphs as they beat Portobello Playboys 46–24 in 2002 and Fife Lions in 2003. 

It was three more years before they won the title again, after losing to Fife Lions in the 2004 final they failed to reach the next two finals. There was also three first round exits in the Challenge Cup against Leigh East, Oulton Raiders and Heworth A.R.L.F.C. Another hat-trick of titles from 2007 was next as they saw off Fife Lions twice and Carluke Tigers in 2009, 18–10 in a game that went to extra-time. 

In the challenge Cup, history was made by the club, when on 25 January 2009 Edinburgh became the first Scottish side to win a game in the competition, beating the RAF 18–16. In the second round they lost to Leeds Met University. They repeated this feat in 2010 when, after knocking out Gloucestershire Warriors 36–32, they lost out to Blackwood Bulldogs in the second round. In the league Carluke gained revenge by defeating the Eagles in the 2010 final 10–14. 2011 and 2012 brought the title count up to nine, with victories over Ayrshire Storm 26–10 and Aberdeen Warriors 36–10. Following three years out of the Finals the Eagles were runners up in 2017 behind Strathmore Silverbacks. After a 6-year wait 2018 saw the Eagles lift their 10th title with victory over Strathmore Silverbacks on points difference. 2019 saw the Eagles enter the North East Rugby league Competition which they went on to win, beating Jarrow Vikings in the grand final on golden point 38–34, along with defeating Strathmore for the 2019 Scottish Cup which sees them entered into the 2020 Challenge cup competition
