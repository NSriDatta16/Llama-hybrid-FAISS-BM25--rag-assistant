Jazz Age chronicles
Jazz Age has been around in one form or another for the past 20 years. It was inspired by the roleplaying game Call of Cthulhu, and were published in three issues by EF Graphics and six issues by Caliber Comics in 1989 and the early 1990s. The comic returned as a webcomic in 2002, as part of the Modern Tales subscription site Adventurestrips.com. After Adventurestrips folded, Jazz Age relocated to its own site, but still used the Modern Tales subscription system. Later Jazz Age was published online as part of Graphic Smash, which also belonged to the Modern Tales family of sites until the closure o the site in 2012. The comic was nominated for an Ignatz Award in the category "Outstanding Online Comic" in 2003 and named one of the best webcomics of 2004 by The Webcomics Examiner.
