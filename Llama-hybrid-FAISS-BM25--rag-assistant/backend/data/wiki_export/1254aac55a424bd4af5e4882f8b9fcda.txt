"You're So Good to Me" is a song written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love for the American rock band the Beach Boys, released on July 5, 1965, on their ninth studio album Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!). It was later included as the B-side of the group's single "Sloop John B", which was released on March 21, 1966. Mojo later wrote that the song was the closest the group had come to northern soul.

Background and recording
Brian Wilson wrote "You're So Good to Me" while in Hawaii. He commented on the song, "The ones that aren't the hardest, right, they're the best… 'You're So Good to Me' was written in 20 minutes. I knew it was special. The songs that come the fastest are the ones I like the most."

The basic track for "You're So Good to Me" was recorded at Western Studios in early May 1965. Take 24 was used as the master. On May 24, the lead and backing vocals for the song were recorded at Columbia Studios. Wilson wrote in 1990 that the track was "spearheaded by a guitar sent through a Leslie speaker. It gave it an eerie effect."

Wilson dubbed it a "tongue song" for its repeated "la, la, la" backing vocals in the chorus.
