History 
The RM 20 billion township was launched in 2004 by SP Setia Berhad. It was formerly known as North Hummock Estate, which was owned by the family-controlled See Hoy Chan Group. However, instead of developing the land themselves, the group sold the land to SP Setia.

The project consists of a few major developments marketed as Setia Alam (a 2,525-acre integrated township with mixed residential and commercial development), Setia Eco Park (791 acres of fully gated and guarded luxury semi-dee and bungalow development and is Malaysia's first eco township), Setia City (a 240-acre integrated green city centre development), Alam Nusantara by PKNS, and Anjung Sari by Sazean Group. Both Alam Nusantara's and Anjung Sari's lands (totaling 614.26 acres) were sold by SP Setia to PKNS as part of SP Setia's strategy to develop the Setia Alam development.
SP Setia's Setia Alam and Setia Eco Park townships have won a number of awards locally and internationally, including the World's Best Master Plan Development for Setia Eco Park in FIABCI International Prix d'Excellence Award 2007 held in Barcelona, Spain. In 2013, Setia Alam won the World's Best Master Plan Development in FIABCI, held in Taichung, Taiwan.

Location and accessibility 
Setia Alam is located on the western flank of Shah Alam, just adjacent to its boundary with Klang. It is served by a spur route of the NKVE . Selangor State Route  links Setia Alam to Puncak Alam and ultimately Kuala Selangor due north and downtown Klang due south.

The closest rail station is the  KTM Klang, which is about 7.6km south. RapidKL bus route 753 connects Setia Alam to the Section 14 bus hub in downtown Shah Alam.

Traffic congestion along the NKVE-Setia Alam Link during rush hour has become rampant in recent years as more residents moved into the township, especially with the completion of apartments at Setia Alam North and spillover from neighbouring townships, such as Bandar Bukit Raja, Aman Perdana, and Meru. A  upgrade to the Setai Alam interchange was announced in March 2023.
