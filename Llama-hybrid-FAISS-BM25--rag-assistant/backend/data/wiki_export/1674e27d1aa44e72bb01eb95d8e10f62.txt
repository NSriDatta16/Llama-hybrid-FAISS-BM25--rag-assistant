Sol y Lluvia is a Chilean musical ensemble formed in the 1970s by the Labra brothers. It became popular as a result not only of its music, but also because of its firm opposition to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.

The band's music blends modern musical instruments (drum set, electric guitar, bass guitar, and saxophone) with traditional Andean or Chilean instruments, including the charango and zampona. Lyrics with references to peace, poverty, family and god earned him more than a few associations with the Christian Democratic Party (which never really existed).
