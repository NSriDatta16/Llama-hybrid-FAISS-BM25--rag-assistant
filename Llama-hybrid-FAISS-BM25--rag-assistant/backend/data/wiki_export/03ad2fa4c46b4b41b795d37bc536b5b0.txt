Ćiribiribela is the ninth and final studio album by Yugoslav rock band Bijelo Dugme, released in 1988. Bijelo Dugme would split-up in 1989, and Ćirbiribela would be the band's last release (excluding compilation albums) before the band's 2005 reunion and the live album Turneja 2005: Sarajevo, Zagreb, Beograd.

Background
Ćiribiribela recording sessions revealed the crisis within the band. Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregović hired studio musician Nenad Stefanović "Japanac" and Bajaga i Instruktori member Vladimir "Vlajko" Golubović on to play bass guitar and drums respectively on the songs "Lijepa naša" ("Our Beautiful") and "Evo, zakleću se" ("Here, I Swear"), much to dissatisfaction of Bijelo Dugme bassist Zoran Redžić and drummer Ipe Ivandić. Recorded during the political crisis in Yugoslavia, Ćiribiribela was—just like its predecessor, Pljuni i zapjevaj moja Jugoslavijo (Spit and Sing, My Yugoslavia)—marked by Goran Bregović's pacifist efforts: the album cover featured Edward Hicks' painting Noah's Ark, the song "Lijepa naša" featured the national anthem of Croatia "Lijepa naša domovino" ("Our Beautiful Homeland") combined with the Serbian World War I patriotic song "Tamo daleko" ("There, Far Away"), and the title track featured lyrics about a couple which wonders what are they going to do if war begins, and concludes that they are going to "stay at home and kiss". The lyrics for the song "Đurđevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim" were, by Bregović's words, inspired by a verse from Đorđe Balašević's song "Priča o Vasi Ladačkom" ("The Story of Vasa Ladački").

Reception
Rock critic Darko Glavan wrote about the album in Danas:

Rock critic Vladimir Stakić wrote in Borba:

The album's biggest hit was "Đurđevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim", which featured Fejat Sejdić Trumpet Orchestra. Other hits included "Evo zakleću se", "Ako ima Boga", "Šta ima novo", "Nakon svih ovih godina", pop-influenced "Napile se ulice" and Dalmatian folk music-inspired "Ćirbiribela".

"Đurđevdan" video ban
After the album release, Radio-Television Belgrade decided to finance and produce a video for the song "Đurđevdan je, a ja nisam s onom koju volim". The original idea was for the video to feature iconography inspired by Serbian Army in World War I. The video shoot was organized in the village Koraćica in Central Serbia. The band came to the video shoot reportedly not knowing anything about the concept of the video about to be shot. The band members were to wear insignia-less military uniforms along with old weapons, but Islamović thought it too "pro-war", refusing to wear a military uniform. Eventually, the band and the video director reached an agreement: everyone, except Islamović, wore Serbian traditional costumes, with only several of the original props used. Still, after the video was recorded, the Radio-Television Belgrade executives themselves decided not to broadcast it, fearing it might remind of the Chetnik movement.

Promotional tour and Bijelo Dugme disbandment
At the beginning of 1989, the band went on a tour which should have lasted until April 1. The concert in Belgrade, held at Belgrade Fair – Hall 1 on 4 February, was attended by about 13,000 people. The concert in Sarajevo's Zetra, held on 11 February, was also very successful; it was attended by more than 20,000 people. However, on some concerts in Croatia, the audience booed and threw various objects on stage while the band performed their pro-Yugoslav songs.

After the concert in Modriča, held on March 15, with four concerts left until the end of the tour, Islamović checked into a hospital with kidney pains. This event revealed the existing conflicts inside the band: Bregović claimed that Islamović had no problems during the tour, while the band's manager, Raka Marić, stated that Bijelo Dugme would search for a new singer for the planned concerts in China and Soviet Union. Bregović himself went to Paris, leaving Bijelo Dugme's future status open for speculations. As Yugoslav Wars broke out in 1991, it became clear that Bijelo Dugme will not continue their activity.

Ćirbiribela would be the band's last release (excluding compilation albums) before the band's 2005 reunion and the live album Turneja 2005: Sarajevo, Zagreb, Beograd (Tour 2005: Sarajevo, Zagreb, Belgrade).
