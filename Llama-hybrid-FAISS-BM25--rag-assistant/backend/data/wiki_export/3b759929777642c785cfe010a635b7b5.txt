History

In 1547, a two-storey castle was built at the headland by Colla MacDonnell. The castle was damaged and partly destroyed due to English sieges under Sir James Croft in the 1550s. Rebuilt afterwards, Colla MacDonnell died at the castle in 1558, and his son Gillaspick MacDonnell subsequently inherited it.

The hollow below the castle is known as Lag na Sassenach (Hollow of the English) and it was allegedly during the 16th century that a troop of English soldiers besieging the castle were surrounded and killed there.

Sorley Boy MacDonnell, brother of Colla, later acquired the castle when trading property with Gillaspick. He later handed it to the MacAlisters because of their loyalty. The castle remained in the possession of the descendants of the MacAlisters of Kenbane until the 18th century.
