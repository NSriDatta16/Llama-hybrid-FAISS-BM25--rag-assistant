Radio Silence is the first full-length album by the Toronto-based new wave band Blue Peter. Released in 1980, it contained the moderately successful single "Video Verite", as well as the eponymous single "Radio Silence", known for its simple "dying keyboard" riff. The album ranked 60th in CFNY's Top 80 Albums of 1980.

The original LP release credits production to Jasper and Blue Peter.  The CD issue from 2007 credits the producers as Kevin Doyle, Chris Wardman and Jasper.

The band lineup for the live version of Take Me to War was the final incarnation of Blue Peter, featuring Humphrey, Wardman, Jason Sniderman on keyboards, Ric Joudrey on bass and Owen Tennyson on drums.
