Reception
Critical reception was mixed. Writing in the Daily Mirror, television editor Tony Pratt called the first series 'one of the best [sitcoms] ITV has produced for ages. It's lively, adult and funny'.

However, The Guardian felt 'sorry for Imelda Staunton...who deserves a better script' with Hugh Hebert labelling the series 'dire' and referring to the character of Izzy as a 'caricature witless teacher who was God's promo for Baker MacGregor Re-Education Inc.'
