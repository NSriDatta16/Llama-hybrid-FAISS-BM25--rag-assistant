Criticism
There has been many criticism by political observers in Indonesia concerning the presence of multiple maritime law enforcement agencies in Indonesia which tend to overlap authority between one another in the maritime zone of the country. As of 2015, maritime law enforcement in Indonesia is conducted by 12 different agencies from different ministries of the government. The Navy is also authorized to conduct maritime law enforcement in certain cases as it is stated in the constitution of the country.
There has been plans to amalgamate these different maritime law enforcement agencies to become a singular national "Indonesian Coast Guard" such as the Coast Guard of the United States of America and Coast Guard of India since 2011. In February 2020, President Joko Widodo announced that he intended to have Maritime Security Agency as Indonesian coast guard. 
On March 2022, the government issue regulation on Governance of Maritime Security, Safety and Law Enforcement at Indonesiaâ€™s Territorial Water and Jurisdiction and designate Maritime Security Agency as coordinating body for all maritime law enforcement agencies.
