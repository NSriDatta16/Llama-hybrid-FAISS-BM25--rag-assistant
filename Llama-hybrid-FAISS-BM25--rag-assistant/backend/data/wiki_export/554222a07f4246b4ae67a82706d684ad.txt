In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space  is said to be collectionwise Hausdorff if given any closed discrete subset of , there is a pairwise disjoint family of open sets with each point of the discrete subset contained in exactly one of the open sets. 

Here a subset  being discrete has the usual meaning of being a discrete space with the subspace topology (i.e., all points of  are isolated in ).

Properties 
 Every T1 space that is collectionwise Hausdorff is also Hausdorff.

 Every collectionwise normal space is collectionwise Hausdorff.  (This follows from the fact that given a closed discrete subset  of , every singleton   is closed in  and the family of such singletons is a discrete family in .)

 Metrizable spaces are collectionwise normal and hence collectionwise Hausdorff.
