My Lives is a box set compilation of demos, outtakes, B-sides, soundtrack cuts, live recordings and album cuts by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel. It was released on November 22, 2005. The album name is derivative of the Billy Joel song "My Life". The liner notes were written by longtime Rolling Stone magazine contributor Anthony DeCurtis.

The 4-CD set is notable for including numerous tracks that were previously released but had never been available on an official Billy Joel album, including songs from his days with the Lost Souls, the Hassles, and Attila; various B-sides; and soundtrack contributions such as "Why Should I Worry?" which his character sang in the Disney animated film Oliver & Company. A bonus DVD is also included featuring live performances from River of Dreams Tour.

The cover of the boxed set was painted by Joel's daughter, Alexa Ray Joel, when she was seven years old.

Release
It was Joel's 20th album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at  in December 2005.

In a 2018 interview, Joel seemed to indicate the boxed set was compiled and released without his consent, stating that "it was unfinished stuff that never should have been heard. I didn’t want anything to do with it. I refer to that album as Twigs and Stems and Seeds — you’re not supposed to smoke that shit."
