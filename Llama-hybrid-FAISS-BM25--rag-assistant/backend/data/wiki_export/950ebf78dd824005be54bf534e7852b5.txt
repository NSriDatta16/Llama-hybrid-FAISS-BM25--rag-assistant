History
The origin of the town is related to the devotion that a rancher,  Antônio Miguel da Costa, had for the Catholic representation of the Virgin, Nossa Senhora Abadia.  The pioneer donated lands in the name of the "saint" with the intention of starting a town near Goiatuba and about 170 kilometers from Goiânia.  In 1942 the town of Bela Vista was formed.  Joviânia became a district of Goiatuba with the name "Joviânia" in 1953, the name being chosen in homage to Joviano Ferreira Barbosa, one of the first founders.  In 1958 it became a municipality.
