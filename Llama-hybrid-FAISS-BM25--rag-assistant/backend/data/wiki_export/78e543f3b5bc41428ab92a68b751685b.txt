History
Around 54 BC, the Romans overcame the Treveri, a Gallic tribe who had lived in the area for several hundred years. The Romans became firmly established in nearby Trier or Augusta Treverorum, a prosperous regional capital, but they also developed communities in the Moselle and Sauer valleys, especially at Wasserbillig (Biliacum), the bridge over the Sauer on the Roman road from Trier to Reims (Civitas Remorum), and Echternach, the bridge on the road from Arlon (Orolaunum), to Bitburg (Vicus Beda). Despite a number of attacks from the middle of the third century, the Romans maintained their influence in the area until about 450 when they were finally conquered by Germanic tribes.
 
There is ample evidence of the Gallo-Roman civilization in the surroundings, not only the terraced orchards and vineyards but also Roman gravestones and monuments along the Sûre valley. Roman ruins have also be found at Pafebierg, not far from Born.

It seems probable that the area where Born now lies later came under the rule of the Abbey of Echternach around the 8th century although it is not specifically mentioned until 1286.

The parish church  dates back to 1856 while Born Castle was built in the early 18th century although there are remains of much older buildings on the site and references dating back to the 13th century . The castle was originally owned by the Lords of Born consisting of members of the Hattstein, Faust d'Aschaffenbourg and de Villiers families.

The Prince Henri railway line from Echternach to Wasserbillig (via Born) was opened in 1874 and remained in service until 1963. The old track has now been converted into a cycle route.
