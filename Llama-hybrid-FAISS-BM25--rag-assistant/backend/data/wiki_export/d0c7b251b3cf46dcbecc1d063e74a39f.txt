History
During World War II, the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force defending the South American coastline against Axis powers submarines.  The first American forces arrived on March 8, 1942 and construction of barracks and other facilities began during August.  The station complement was the 336th Service Group which provided the necessary support resources for the personnel assigned.

American flying units assigned to the airport were:
 397th Bombardment Squadron (6th Bombardment Group) August 18, 1942 – May 4, 1943 (LB-30 (B-24A) Liberator) (Northrup A-17A Nomad)
 51st Fighter Squadron (32d Fighter Group) Dec, 1942-March 9, 1943 (P-40 Warhawk)
 3d Bombardment Squadron (6th Bombardment Group) Apr, 1-May 23, 1943 (LB-30 (B-24A) Liberator)
 91st Reconnaissance Squadron (1st Photographic Group) 1943-1944 (B-25/F-10 Mitchell)

In July 1944, the last aircraft departed from the airport, and most Americans departed. A few remained manning a communications station operated by the Army Communications Service 153d Communications Squadron. The communications facility remained open until January 31, 1947, largely training Peruvian military personnel in communications.
