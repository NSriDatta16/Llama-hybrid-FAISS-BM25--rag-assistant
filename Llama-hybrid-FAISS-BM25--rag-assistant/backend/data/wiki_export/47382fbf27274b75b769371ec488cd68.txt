Uleybury  is a rural locality near Adelaide, South Australia. It is located at the eastern side of the City of Playford local government area, just north of One Tree Hill along Gawler-One Tree Hill Road.

History
A weaver named Moses Bendle Garlick (c. 1784–1859) migrated with his family to South Australia in 1837 on the ship Katherine Stewart Forbes. He settled first at North Adelaide, where he was in business as a builder until at least 1848. He then took up land at Munno Para East, naming it Uley, after his native village Uley in Gloucestershire, England, and there built a home which the family occupied from around 1850.  His eldest son, the architect Daniel Garlick, opened a practice in nearby Gawler. Moses was a devout Baptist and lay preacher, and donated to the Church an acre of land where in 1851 he built the Uley Chapel at a cost of £400. Upon his death on 1 October 1859 Moses was buried in the small Cemetery which adjoined the Chapel.

The settlement became known as "Uley Bury" or "Uleybury" around 1855, Uleybury School was erected in 1856 on church land, and Rev. J. P. Buttfield operated it as a church school until 1874, when the Government assumed control. It was closed in 1971 and reopened as a museum in 1979.

The District Council of Munno Para East (1853-1933) District Office was located at the former Uley Chapel (demolished in 1981).
