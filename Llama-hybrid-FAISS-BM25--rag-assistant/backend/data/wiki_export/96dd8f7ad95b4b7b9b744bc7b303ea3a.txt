In 2006, the CTA began the Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project, which involved the renovation and reconstruction of all Brown Line stations to allow eight car trains to run on the line and to ensure that all stations are accessible to passengers with disabilities. Southport Station was closed between April 2, 2007, and March 30, 2008, and was completely rebuilt.
