"Mama From the Train", also known as "Mama From the Train (A Kiss, A Kiss)", is a popular song written by Irving Gordon and published in 1956. The song is about memories of a now-deceased mother, whose Pennsylvania Dutch-influenced English leads to quaint phrasings.

Song's influence 
The title, as printed on the sheet music — Mama From the Train (A Kiss, A Kiss) — and the first line of the refrain — "Throw Mama from the train a kiss, a kiss" — inspired two parodies:

Homer and Jethro, a country music comedy team, recorded a parody of this song that included the lines "Throw mama from the train, but quick, but quick."
In New York City during the 1950s, Jewish street vendors who sold knishes near subway train stations  lettered signs that punned, "Throw Mama from the train a knish, a knish ... don't leave her hungry behind".
In 1987, Danny DeVito and Billy Crystal starred in the dark comedy film Throw Momma From the Train, which was also based in part on the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers on a Train.
