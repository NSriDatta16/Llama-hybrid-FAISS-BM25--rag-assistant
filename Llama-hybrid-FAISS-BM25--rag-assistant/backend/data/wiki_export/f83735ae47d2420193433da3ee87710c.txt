A Katsa is a field intelligence officer of the Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel. The word katsa is a Hebrew acronym for ,  "intelligence officer", literally "gathering officer".  A katsa is a case officer who runs agents to clandestinely collect intelligence.

Use of sayanim
Katsas may utilise sayanim, singular: sayan, (, lit. Helpers, Assistants) for their operations. Sayanim are recruited to provide support for Mossad operations, and may or may not receive payment. A sayan running a car rental agency, for instance, could help Mossad officers rent a car without the usual documentation. Sayanim are often not citizens of Israel or may be dual nationals. The use of sayanim enables the Mossad to operate with a smaller budget to conduct operations worldwide.
