The Chair of Modern History at the University of Glasgow was founded in 1893 as the Chair of History.  In 1956 the title was changed to Modern History to reflect the establishment of the Edwards Chair of Medieval History. It is the second-oldest chair of history in the United Kingdom outside of Oxbridge.
