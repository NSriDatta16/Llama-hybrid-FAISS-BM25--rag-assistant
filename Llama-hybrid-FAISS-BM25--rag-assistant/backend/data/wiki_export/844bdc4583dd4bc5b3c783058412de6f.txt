The Face is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance, the fourth novel  in the  "Demon Princes" series. It was published in 1979, nearly twelve years after the third.

Plot summary
Kirth Gersen pursues the notorious criminal Lens Larque, one of the five so-called Demon Princes, across several worlds, most notably Aloysius, the harsh desert world Dar Sai (inhabited by the Darsh, of whom Larque is one) and the more temperate and genteel Methel, which has grown rich doing business on Dar Sai. Gersen determines that Larque is connected somehow with a seemingly worthless Dar Sai company called Kotzash Mutual. Gersen, by dint of skill and cleverness, gains control of the company. He also rescues Jerdian Chanseth, a young aristocratic Methlen woman, and a brief romance blossoms between them.

Gersen then travels to Methel to investigate Kotzash. Gersen attempts to renew his relationship with Jerdian, going so far as to buy the mansion next to her family's, but is rejected as a suitor by her father, bank owner Adario Chanseth, who uses the law to nullify the sale of the house. It turns out that Larque had himself tried to buy the same estate, but had also been thwarted by the same Methlen law, with Chanseth telling Larque (not knowing who he was at the time) that he had no wish to see his "great Darsh face hanging over my garden fence."

Gersen learns that Kotzash Mutual has done extensive work on Shanitra, the small moon of Methel, for some mysterious reason. It is well known that Shanitra has no useful deposits of ore and is practically worthless. Nonetheless, Kotzash has gone to great pains to place explosives all across its surface.

Gersen finally tracks Larque down on Methel and fatally poisons him. In his final moments, Larque begs Gersen to press a button, but Gersen denies him his last request, at least while he is alive to enjoy his most grandiose scheme. However, after Larque is dead, Gersen considers, then presses it. Explosives are set off which shape Shanitra into the semblance of Larque's face. He then phones Chanseth and informs him "There's a great Darsh face hanging over the garden wall."

Reception
Greg Costikyan reviewed The Face in Ares Magazine #1. Costikyan commented that "All in all, The Face is an intriguing and well-plotted adventure in Vance's usual strange style. It is also considerably more expert and cleanly written than most of Vance's other work; apparently, Vance is still refining his style and sharpening his abilities. The Face is well worth reading, especially if you can get hold of the previous three novels in the 'Demon Princes' series."
