The men's single-shot 100 meter running deer competition was one of 15 shooting sports events on the Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics programme.  A deer-shaped target made 10 runs of , with the shooter firing one shot during each run. The runs lasted about 4 seconds each and took place  distant from the shooter. There were three concentric circles on the target, with the smallest counting for 4 points, the middle for 3, and the outermost for 2. A hit outside the circles but still on the target (except on the haunch) counted for 1 point. The maximum possible score was thus 40 points. Each nation could enter up to 12 shooters.

Results

De Wael also lists another British shooter, John Bashford, as having competed and placed lower than Barbillat. However, the Official Report makes no mention of Bashford in its list of competitors.
