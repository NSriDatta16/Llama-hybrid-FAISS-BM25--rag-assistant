History
Cave Spring High School opened in 1956. In 1968, the high school was moved to its current site, while its original building became Cave Spring Junior High School, which would later become Cave Spring Middle School in 2002.  Cave Spring held grades 10-12 for numerous years until 2002, when it fed approximately half of its 10-12 population into Hidden Valley High School after it was completed and first opened. In 2019, the high school underwent a $43.3 million renovation, with the "new" Cave Spring opening its doors in August 2020.
