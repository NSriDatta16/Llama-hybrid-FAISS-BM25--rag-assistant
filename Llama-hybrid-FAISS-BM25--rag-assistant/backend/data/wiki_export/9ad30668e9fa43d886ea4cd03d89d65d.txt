Beth Kustan (,  or Bethkustan) is a neighbourhood of the municipality and district of Midyat, Mardin Province in southeastern Turkey. It is located in the historical region of Tur Abdin. Beth Kustan is inhabited by Assyrians who belong to the Syriac Orthodox Church and speak Turoyo, a dialect of Neo-Aramaic. 
 
In the village, there are churches of Mor Dimet and Mor Eliyo.

The village had a population of 154 in 2022.

Etymology
The Syriac name of the village is derived from "beth" ("house" in Syriac) and "Kustan" ("Constantine" in Syriac), thus Beth Kustan translates to "house of Constantine".

History
The church of Mor Eliyo was constructed in 343 AD. It is suggested that the village was founded by a member of the Roman limitanei (frontier militia) named Constans in the 4th century AD.

At the onset of the Assyrian genocide, in 1915, Haco, agha (chief) of the Kurtak tribe, warned the villagers of an impending attack by Turkish and Kurdish soldiers. Despite initial hesitation, upon receiving news of the massacre of Assyrians at Zaz, all but two villagers fled to the neighbouring village of Hah. Beth Kustan was subsequently ransacked by Kurdish soldiers, and the two remaining villagers were killed. The Assyrians resisted Kurdish and Turkish attacks at Hah until a truce was negotiated by Haco, but were not able to leave until Çelebi, agha of the Heverkan tribe, helped them to return to Beth Kustan in 1922.

The village was officially named Alagöz in the 1930s as a result of the state's turkification policy. Most of the village's population were forced to leave in the 1960s and 1970s due to the Kurdish–Turkish conflict and emigrated abroad to the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1993, it was alleged that seven villagers were detained and tortured by Turkish paramilitaries.  On 12 February 2015, Beth Kustan was restored as the official name of the village.
