History
SCA, the parent company of Essity, which is the parent company of TENA, was founded in Sweden in 1929 by Ivar Kreuger as a paper packaging company. The company has produced personal hygiene products since the 1970s. The TENA brand was first used by the separate company MÃ¶lnlycke in the 1980s, then acquired by SCA in the early 1990s. In 1998, SCA Personal Care was created and took control of 25% of the world's share of incontinence products. The company's incontinence products branched off into another name called TENA later that year.
