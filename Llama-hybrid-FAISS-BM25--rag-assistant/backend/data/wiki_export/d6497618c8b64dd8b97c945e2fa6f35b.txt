Tiendesitas ("a collection of little stores") is a shopping complex located along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue in, Ugong, Pasig.

Development
The complex began operations on September 26, 2005, and was developed by Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership (OCLP). Constructed at a cost of P200 million, Tiendesitas is a part of Ortigas East (former Frontera Verde), an interim 18.5 hectare Ortigas Center development project, much like the Greenhills Shopping Center.

The complex is surrounded by parking slots and is mainly served by jeepneys on C-5 and by buses which stop a short walk from the Tiendesitas gate.

Tiendesitas Villages
Tiendesitas is a complex of wide-opened "villages" featuring stylized Filipino architecture. The complex is made up of twelve pavilions inspired by Maranao architecture, which in turn traces its roots back to the bahay kubo. The roof of each pavilion is covered with chemically treated Cogon grass, and is equipped with sprinklers to avoid mishaps during fires. Duyans (hammocks) are scattered around the development to offer short breaks during shopping trips.  The Filipiniana inspiration extends to the comfort rooms: old kalesa wheels were transformed into chandelier frames to light up these restrooms.

More than 450 traders from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao specializing in merchandise from regions not usually found in mainstream retail outlets exhibit their wares in Tiendesitas' shopping pavilions. Haggling a la tiangge is a common negotiating tactic among local merchants.

Handicrafts Village

Philippine-made handicrafts (by members of Philippine Chamber of Handicrafts Industries) from home décor to fashion accessories are found at the Handicrafts Village. Benguet handicrafts are included in the limited edition merchandise to be found here.

Fashion Village
The Fashion Village showcases apparel and accessories from Philippine designers, notably Marikina.  Fashions sold in the Fashion Village include fabric woven in various regions of Mindanao, shell earrings from Cebu, and necklaces from other provinces in the South.

Personal Care and Novelties Village
Personal care and toiletries sold in the Personal Care and Novelties Village include homegrown, homemade organic soaps, lotions and aromatherapy lines developed by local traders. While these products normally surface only during bazaars, the Personal Care and Novelties Village allows them a year-round place to be exhibited and marketed to the public.

The Tiendesitas opening in September 2005 began with a week-long Bonsai exhibit at the People's Village and was followed in October by an antiques exhibit.
