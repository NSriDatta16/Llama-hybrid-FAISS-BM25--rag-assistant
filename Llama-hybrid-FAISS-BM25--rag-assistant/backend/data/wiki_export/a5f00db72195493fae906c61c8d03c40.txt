History

Islamic University of Technology, established in 1978, was first known as Islamic Center for Technical, Vocational Training and Research (ICTVTR). It was proposed in the 9th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers (ICFM) held in Dakar, Senegal on 24–28 April 1978. The establishment of IUT in Dhaka, Bangladesh was then approved by the foreign ministers. All the members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) agreed to co-operate for the implementation of the project.

The implementation of the infrastructure commenced with the holding of the first meeting of the Board of Governors in June 1979. Foundation stone of ICTVTR was laid by president Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh on 27 March 1981 in the presence of Yasir Arafat, the then-chairman of the PLO, and Habib Chatty, the then-Secretary General of OIC. The construction of the campus was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$11 Million[US$25 Million (2019)] . ICTVTR was formally inaugurated by Hossain Mohammad Ershad, president of Bangladesh on 14 July 1988.

The 22nd ICFM held in Casablanca, Morocco on 10–11 December 1994 renamed the ICTVTR as Islamic Institute of Technology (IIT). IIT was formally inaugurated by Begum Khaleda Zia, prime minister of Bangladesh on 21 September 1995. The 28th ICFM held in Bamako, Republic of Mali on 25–29 June 2001 commended the efforts of IIT and decided to rename the IIT as Islamic University of Technology (IUT). IUT was formally inaugurated by Begum Khaleda Zia, prime minister of Bangladesh on 29 November 2001.

Over the past three decades IUT has expanded with the construction of new academic buildings, halls of residence, and student facilities.

The university started offering regular courses from December 1986 and completed 35 academic years in 2022.
