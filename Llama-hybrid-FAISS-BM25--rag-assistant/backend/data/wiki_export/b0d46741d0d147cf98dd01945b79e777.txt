Outdoors space of the museum

Perimeter:The perimeter is the first impression that the visitors here will have. Since the Museum of Fine Arts itself has functions of both leisure and art, the designers of the perimeter decided to emphasize presenting a sculptural atmosphere. This makes people feel relaxed and connect the feeling with the art itself.
Park Walkways and Facilities: After entering the park through the entrance, visitors can easily see signs which point out the way to the museum and leisure facilities. Public restrooms and seats are located along the walkways.
Semi-Circular Outdoor Plaza and Covered Walkway: The covered walkway provides a direct path to the educational spaces inside the museum such as studio classrooms and auditorium. In this way, the inside and outside activities are connected.
Sculpture Park: The sculpture park is composed of the lawn behind the administrative area and the southwestern park. It was chiefly constructed and developed during the first phrase. With various types of scenery such as lawns and groves, the sculpture park can display different types of sculptures in different settings. Though most of the sculptures are located in the sculpture park, some are arranged in the ecology park.
Ecology park: The ecology park is composed of a marsh, a lake, a small island, a forest area, an observation platform, and footpaths. With the concept of ecological restoration, the designers of scenery have established the scenery which does not prevent creatures from inhabitation or breeding.
