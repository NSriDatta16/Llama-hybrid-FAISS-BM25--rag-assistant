Early and personal life

Career 

Keeravani first began his career as an assistant music director with Telugu composer K. Chakravarthy and Malayalam composer C. Rajamani in 1987. He assisted in movies such as Collectorgari Abbayi and  Bharathamlo Arjunudu in the late 1980s. During this time, he also sought the guidance of the veteran lyricist Veturi for over a year.

Keeravani's first big break as an independent musician came with the film Kalki in 1990, but the film never got released and the soundtrack also went unnoticed. It was director Mouli's 1990 film Manasu Mamatha that brought him to the limelight and was considered his first released movie. However, it was Ram Gopal Varma's blockbuster film Kshana Kshanam (1991) that made Keeravani an established music director. All the songs of this movie went on to become top chartbusters and Keeravani was flooded with offers from all across south Indian film industries. His first major Hindi film was Criminal (1994).

Keeravani mentions Ilaiyaraaja, John Williams and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan as composers who influenced him. Some of the films which inspired his music include Fiddler on the Roof (1971), Coming to America (1988), and Phone Booth (2002).
