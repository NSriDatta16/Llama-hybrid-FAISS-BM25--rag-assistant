"Nuestro Amor" is a song by Mexican pop group RBD, released as the lead single from the group's second studio album of the same name on 25 August 2005. The song was used to promote the second season of the soap opera Rebelde.

Background and release 
The Mexican telenovela Rebelde began production of its second season in 2005. The group (who lead the cast of young actors in the show) recorded their second studio album and toured while on break. "Nuestro Amor" was released on 25 August, and the song was used as the new theme song for the series. Unlike the first season, parts of the music video were not used for the intro.

Following the success of the band's Brazilian edition of their debut album, production decided to give Nuestro Amor the same treatment, and had the group record a Portuguese version titled Nosso Amor Rebelde. The song's Portuguese version is called "Nosso Amor" and was released as a single in Brazil in May 2006. A special music video for this version of the song was planned but ended up being scrapped.

An English version of the song was also recorded, under the title "This Is Love", as part of RBD's first English studio album, Rebels, released in November 2006. Despite singing the second pre-chorus with Maite in the original and Portuguese versions, Alfonso was absent in this version of the song.

Composition and lyrics 
"Nuestro Amor" is a Latin pop, pop rock and teen pop song that lasts for three minutes and 33 seconds. It was written by Memo Méndez Guiu and Emil "Billy" Méndez, and produced by Pedro Daminan, the show's executive producer.  It is structured in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. The song is assumed to be sung from the point of view of the actors' characters in the telenovela, although Alfonso and Anahí don't sing together like Dulce and Christopher.

The lyrics are about the group celebrating their new love. The song opens with Dulce and Christopher, each describing their love as "magical" and "easy". The first pre-chorus is done by Maite with Christian, comparing it to "a dream", and saying how "everything is happening". During the chorus, the band affirm that their love "i[t']s like this / And there's nothing to do about it", asserting "this is how it happens, this love". The second verse is sung by Christian and Anahí, with the former calling it "so simple" and the latter stating "And I don't know how long [this] love will last / But today", before stating in unison that "there's nothing better", with two small ad-libs from Anahí. The second pre-chorus is done by Maite again, this time with Alfonso. The second chorus is repeated twice, before leading to a bridge containing a guitar solo. The last chorus is also repeated, and includes four ad-libs from Anahí and Christian each, although the former sings in a higher range.

Music video

The music video for the song was filmed in early August 2005 at Pedregal, Distrito Federal in Mexico and was directed by Amin Azali. It was their first video not directed by Pedro Damián and premiered in September in the United States and Mexico.

It is supposed to take place sometime during the events of the telenovela, as the pairings shown in the video are from the show, and not real life. The vídeo is about a "date" the girls and boys of RBD have. It starts with a phone call between Dulce Maria and Christopher, with Dulce in a bathub and Christopher in a window of another building. The girls then dress up elegantly for the date night they are about to have. The male members get ready for the romantic dinner, too, in a Japanese-looking house, where they look for the girls as they had left clues for them in order to find them. Finally, the band walk outside and sit around, sing, enjoy the moonlight and oddly, share some bottles of milk from which they drink.

Chart performance

The song became RBD's fifth major hit in Mexico. The song peaked at number two on Billboard Latin Pop Airplay chart and number six on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs and Latin Tropical Airplay chart. The song also peaked at number 33 in its 10th week on the Romanian Airplay Chart.
