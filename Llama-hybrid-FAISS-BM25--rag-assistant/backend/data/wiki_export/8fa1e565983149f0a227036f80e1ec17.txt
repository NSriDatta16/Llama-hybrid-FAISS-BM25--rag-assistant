All songs were either taken from The Modern Dance, the group's first LP, or were among Pere Ubu's earliest singles later collected on Terminal Tower. The only exception is the song "Can't Believe It", which is exclusive to this release. The track listing on the CD version's rear tray card and disc label are incorrect; all the correct songs are listed but in scrambled order.

Note: The 2021 Record Store Day reissue omits Track 6 "Humor Me" and Track 12 "30 Seconds Over Tokyo" to increase the fidelity of the vinyl reissue. However, those two songs are present on a download code that comes with the vinyl. This reissue has "V.21C" added to the title, and the cover is Yellow instead of White.
