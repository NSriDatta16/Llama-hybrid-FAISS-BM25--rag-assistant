Early life
McQueen was born in Los Angeles on July 13, 1988, to Stacey (, now Stacia Robitaille), a humanitarian and former actress, and Chad McQueen, a race car driver and former actor.  His paternal grandparents are actor Steve McQueen and Filipino actress Neile Adams.  Neile Adams' niece is Filipino-Spanish socialite Isabel Preysler, mother of Chabeli Iglesias, Julio Iglesias Jr. and Enrique Iglesias, making McQueen and the Iglesiases second cousins. His stepfather, Luc Robitaille, is a professional ice hockey executive and former player. McQueen is the oldest of four children with a half-brother, Chase (b. 1995), and a half-sister, Madison (b. 1996), from his father's remarriage and a half-brother, Jesse Robitaille (b. 1995), from his mother's remarriage. His stage name is "Steven R. McQueen", the "R" referring to his stepfather's surname Robitaille.  McQueen described his relationship with his father and his stepfather in an interview with the New York Post, "My stepdad has been more like a biological dad in my life. I'm pretty close with my biological dad, but I think of him more like an uncle. It's a good relationship."

In his mid-teens, McQueen moved around from city to city with his parents, included living in Detroit and being homeschooled until his graduation.  It was while living in Detroit that he started watching movies all day long, including those of his grandfather, "From there, my passion for it slowly unfolded. I went to a couple of classes and I grew to love it."  Eventually, he packed his bags, moved back to Los Angeles and started taking acting classes.

In an interview, McQueen was asked whether it was hard being mean in the film and he replied, "You know, it was actually really fun because I'm not really that mean in real life. It's all just pretend and really fun."
