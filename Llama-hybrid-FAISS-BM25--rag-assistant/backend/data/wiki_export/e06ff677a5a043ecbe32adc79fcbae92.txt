The Sisters of Charity of Montreal 
In 1855 Toledo, Ohio was in the midst of a cholera and malaria epidemic. Father Augustine Campion, pastor of St. Francis de Sales Church, asked the Sisters of Charity of Montreal for assistance.  They established St. Vincent Hospital. 

In 1983 the Sisters of Charity of Montreal established the Grey Nuns Health System to direct, support and conduct their health care, elder care and social service systems throughout the United States. As other religious congregations expressed interest in joining the Grey Nuns Health System, in 1986 the Grey Nuns Health System name changed to Covenant Health Systems. St. Vincent's Medical Center in Toledo joined Catholic Health Partners, while Covenant Health Systems retained management of the facilities in New England. Covenant Health Systems sponsors "Covenant Health Inc."
