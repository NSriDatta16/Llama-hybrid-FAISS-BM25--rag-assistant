History
Part of the families lived temporarily in the nearby settlement Nov, and later Avnei Eitan was founded in 1978. The settlement is named after six war victims including 3 soldiers that were killed in the Yom Kippur War, and a woman that deceased from a serious illness.

In December 1991, members of the moshav left the settlement and moved to live three kilometers east of it, near the ceasefire line fence between Israel and Syria. The moshav, which belongs to the Hapoel HaMizrachi movement, was shut down in protest of foreclosures on property and money carried out by the banks. Members that left the moshav burned tires at the entrance to the settlement and later confronted IDF officers, who demanded that they evacuate the place because they posed a security risk. Police forces, under the command of the Golan Heights Police Chief, back then Superintendent Shimon Koren, also arrived at the scene and addressed the strikers with a similar demand. At the same time, the police prevented roadblocks and major traffic routes in the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights police arrested four moshav members for questioning.
