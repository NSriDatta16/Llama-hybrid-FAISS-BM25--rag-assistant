History 
In January 2000, the CRTC approved an application by Christian Radio Manitoba Ltd. for a new specialty FM radio station in Winnipeg, focusing predominantly on Christian music. The group originally planned to broadcast on 107.1 FM, but this was denied by Industry Canada. The station instead chose to broadcast on 95.1 FM instead.

In 2004, Golden West Broadcasting acquired a controlling stake in Christian Radio Manitoba Ltd.
