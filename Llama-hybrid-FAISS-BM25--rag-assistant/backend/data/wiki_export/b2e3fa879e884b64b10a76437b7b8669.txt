The Canadian Teachers' Federation (CTF; ) is a bilingual not-for-profit organization and a national alliance of provincial and territorial teacher organizations representing more than 365,000 elementary and secondary school teachers throughout Canada. The CTF is affiliated with Education International.

History 
Harry Charlesworth was the first president of the CTF, serving from 1920 to 1922.

Public activity 
The CTF advocates for various social justice and equity topics.

In July 2018, at a two-day Canadian Forum on Public Education in Edmonton, the CTF director of research and professional learning spoke about the increase in classroom violence.

In 2014, the CTF created a workâ€“life balance survey, engaging secondary and elementary teachers on issues of stress and imbalance, as well as possible ways to create improvements in this balance. The report brought forward several results, including the fact that many teachers felt a strong tension between work responsibilities, as well as duties and responsibilities outside of the work environment.
