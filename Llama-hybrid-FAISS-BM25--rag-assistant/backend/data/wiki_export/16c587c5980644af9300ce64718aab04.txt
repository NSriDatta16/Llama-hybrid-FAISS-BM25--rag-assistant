Torborg Nedreaas (13 November 1906 – 30 June 1987) was a Norwegian writer. She received  the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature, the Dobloug Prize, the Nordic Council's Literature Prize.

Biography
She was born in  Bergen, Norway. Until 1947 she lived at Leirvik in Hordaland. Then she relocated to Nesodden in Akershus. She trained as a music teacher.

She debuted with the collection of short stories Bak skapet står øksen in 1945. The majority of the stories centered on events and interactions during the Second World War. It was not war literature, but an examination of the occurrences and situations which the war created for people who were not directly involved in the war, but who nonetheless paid a high price because they lived during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.

She wrote a series of novels, novellas, plays and pieces for television.  Many of her books were set in the environment and in settings from Leirvik, where she spent many summers in her childhood. Class differences and poverty are central themes that permeate her work. Her work was recognized with numerous prizes. She received  prestigious Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature (Kritikerprisen) in 1950, the Dobloug Prize (Doblougprisen) in 1964 and in 1972 the Nordic Council's Literature Prize (Nordisk Råds litteraturpris).
