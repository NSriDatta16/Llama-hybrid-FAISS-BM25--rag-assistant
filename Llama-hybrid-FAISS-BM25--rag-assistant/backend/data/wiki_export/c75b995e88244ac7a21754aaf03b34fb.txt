Mount Harriet National Park, officially renamed as Mount Manipur National Park, is a national park located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands union territory of India. The park, established in 1969,  covers about 4.62 km2 (18.00 mi2). Mount Manipur (Mount Harriet) (), which is a part of the park, is the third-highest peak in the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago next to Saddle Peak () in North Andaman and Mount Thullier () in Great Nicobar.
