"Long, Long Ago" is a song dealing with nostalgia, written in 1833 by English composer Thomas Haynes Bayly. Originally called "The Long Ago", its name was apparently changed by the editor Rufus Wilmot Griswold when it was first published, posthumously, in a Philadelphia magazine, along with a collection of other songs and poems by Bayly. The song was well received, and became one of the most popular songs in the United States in 1844.

The first popular recording of the song was that by Geraldine Farrar for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1913.

In 1939, the tune was given new words (revised slightly in 1941) and a bouncier tempo.  It became the 1942 Glenn Miller hit "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)".
