Names changes
The building was originally named The Ritacco Center, after Michael Ritacco, then-superintendent of Toms River Regional Schools, with Poland Spring coming on board as a major sponsor shortly afterwards. In the wake of a bribery scandal, culminating in Ritacco's arrest by the FBI on October 21, 2010, the school district quickly acted to remove his name from the building, opting to call it the Poland Spring Arena instead. The Ritacco Center name was covered with tarps beginning October 26, 2010, the use of the name was discontinued elsewhere including the website and exterior signage was permanently removed in October 2011, though additional occurrences of the name were discovered on parking lot signs in mid-2012 these were subsequently taped over before being scraped off.

In July 2011, the school district announced a new name sponsor for the venue, after the Pine Belt Auto Group signed a $500,000 contract for the naming rights for five years.

In January 2018, the name was officially changed to the "RWJBarnabas Health Arena" after the district signed a five-year deal with RWJBarnabas Health under which the district will be paid a total of $637,500 for the naming rights.
