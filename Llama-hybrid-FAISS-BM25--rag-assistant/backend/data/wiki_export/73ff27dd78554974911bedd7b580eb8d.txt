The settling of this town began around 1920 with the donation of land for the building of a chapel called Capela de São João Batista.  The first houses were of adobe and palm fronds and the economy was based on agriculture and cattle raising.  In 1943 it was raised to the category of district with the name São Joâo Batista do Meia Ponte, after the river with that name.  Later the name was changed to Brazabrantes to honor the Brazilian general Braz Abrantes.  In 1959 it achieved municipal status.
