He is the Executive Vice President of Innovation R&D at Wells Fargo, and the executive chairman of Mimik Technology, Inc. He is known for the 1998 invention of the Alamouti's code, a type of space–time block code.

Early life and education
Siavash Alamouti was born on March 16, 1962, in Tehran, Iran. He graduated from Kharazmi Highschool in 1979. He attended Sharif University of Technology in 1980 for one year, and was expelled during the Iranian Cultural Revolution. Alamouti received B.A.Sc. (1989) and M.A.Sc.

Alamouti's code 
He invented a 2xN MIMO scheme which today is referred to as the Alamouti's code (or Alamouti code). Alamouti’s October 1998 paper in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas of Communications (volume 16, number 8) was selected by IEEE Communication Society for publication in, The Best of the Best: Fifty Years of Communications and Networking Research (2007).

Alamouti's code provided some inspiration for the development of more valuable and general Space Time Block Codes by others, including Nambirajan Seshadri, Vahid Tarokh, Robert Calderbank, and Hamid Jafarkhani. Tarokh, Jafarkhani and Alamouti received the 2013 IEEE Eric E. Sumner award "For contributions to block signaling for multiple antennas".
