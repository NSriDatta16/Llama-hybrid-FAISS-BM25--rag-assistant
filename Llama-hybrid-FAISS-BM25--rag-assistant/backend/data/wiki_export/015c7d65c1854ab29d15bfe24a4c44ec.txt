"Abdel Kader" () is an Algerian traditional song made famous by the Algerian raï artist Khaled. It is mistakenly thought to be about the Emir `Abd al-Qādir al-Jazā'irī, a famous Algerian Muslim religious leader and freedom fighter who resisted the French conquest of Algeria, but is actually about the 12th century Sufi saint Shaikh Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani (1078–1166 AD), the posthumous founder of the Qadiriyya Sufi Order. It is featured on his 1993 studio album N'ssi N'ssi. After his 1993 original album version, Khaled released a solo live version of "Abdel Kader" in his live album Hafla in 1998.

The song gained further popularity after the live performance at Palais omnisports de Paris-Bercy by Khaled, Rachid Taha and Faudel. The joint trio live version was included on the 1998 live album 1,2,3 Soleils.

Charts
The live version by Rachid Taha, Khaled and Faudel was released as a separate single in France reaching #6 in the SNEP, the official French Singles Chart. The song stayed in for 21 consecutive weeks in the French charts in the period November 1998 to March 1999, with 10 weeks of those in the Top 10. It stayed at #6 for the two weeks ending 5 and 12 December 1998. 
 

In France, "Abdel Kader" was certified Silver in 1998 by SNEP, signifying sales of over 50,000 singles.
