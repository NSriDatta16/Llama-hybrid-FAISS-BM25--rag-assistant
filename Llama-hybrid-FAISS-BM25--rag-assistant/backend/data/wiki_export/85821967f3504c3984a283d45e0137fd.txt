Reception
In a contemporary review, Scott Heisel of Punknews.org gave Serious Awesomeness! four stars out of five, saying that it "should hopefully revive interest in this band's waning popularity, as this DVD shows they still have relevance. More importantly, this band is goddamn funny live, and people need to know that. A worthy buy if you're a fan or if you're looking to discover the Aquabats for the first time â€“ all of their bests songs are on here in one form or another, and the Bat Commander is in rare form in these concert pieces."
