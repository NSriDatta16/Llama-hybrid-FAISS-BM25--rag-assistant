Generals

The rank of general is the most senior active rank in the Australian Army. Only the five-star rank of field marshal is higher, but it is reserved for exceptional circumstances and only Sir Thomas Blamey (1951) has attained the rank in a non-ceremonial capacity. There are currently no appointments in the Australian Defence Force (ADF) at the five-star level. With the current structure of the ADF, the rank of general is held only when an officer of the Australian Army is appointed as Chief of the Defence Force.
