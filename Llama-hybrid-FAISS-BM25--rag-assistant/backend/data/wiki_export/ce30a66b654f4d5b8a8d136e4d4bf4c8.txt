A point guard at Saint Peter's College from 2002 to 2006, Clark scored 435 three-pointers in his college career, briefly holding the record for the most three-point shots made in NCAA history, during the end of his senior season. Clark finished as the career leader at the end of the 2006 MAAC tournament, but was soon passed by JJ Redick, who held the NCAA record for three-point field goals made with 457, until 2014, when Oakland's Travis Bader (461+) surpassed him.

In 2004, he averaged 26.7 points per game, and in 2005, he averaged 25.8 points per game; Clark led the nation in points scored per game, becoming just the eighth player to repeat as NCAA Division I scoring champion. He also was one of the Division I steals leaders, with 3.3 per game. He is the all-time leading scorer in Saint Peter's College and New Jersey collegiate history. Clark led the MAAC in scoring for all four seasons. He is also the all-time leader in steals and three-point field goals for the Peacocks.
