The Southern Zone () is a zone in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The Southern Zone is bordered on the south and west by the Amhara Region, on the north by the Central Zone, and on the east by the Afar Region. Towns and cities in the Southern Zone include Maychew, Korem, Zata and Alamata. The South Eastern Zone was separated from the Southern Zone.

The highest point in this Zone is Mount Ferrah Amba (3954 meters; sometimes called Tsibet after the nearby village), one of the southernmost peaks of the Raya Mountains. Due to its prominent location dominating the roadway that runs past it from Mekelle south to Maychew, this mountain has been the scene of several battles. Important bodies of water include Lake Hashenge.
