The 1830 United States census, the fifth  census undertaken in the United States, was conducted on June 1, 1830. The only loss of census records for 1830 involved some countywide losses in Massachusetts, Maryland, and Mississippi.

It determined the population of the 24 states to be 12,866,020, of which 2,009,043 were slaves. The center of population was about 170 miles (274Â km) west of Washington, D.C. in present-day Grant County, West Virginia.

This was the first census in which a cityNew Yorkrecorded a population of over 200,000.

Apportionment Populations

In the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 states:

In order to correctly apportion Representatives pursuant to this Census, it was necessary for the Census to compute not only the total population of each state, but the number of free persons and slaves, and then to compute the apportionment population, or Federal number, for each state (and territory) by adding three-fifths of the slave population to the free population. (This was computed by county, so the totals for each state may be off by as many as 1.2 persons due to rounding.)
