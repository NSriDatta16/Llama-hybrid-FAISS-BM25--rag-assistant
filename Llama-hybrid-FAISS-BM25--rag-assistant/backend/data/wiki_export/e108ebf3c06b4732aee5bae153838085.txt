Story
Following the death of his close friend and mentor , Shigeru Jo joins the evil organization Black Satan. With the promise of great power, and fueled by a desire for revenge, Shigeru undergoes surgery to become one of Black Satan's super soldiers. Secretly, Shigeru knows that Black Satan was responsible for Numata's murder, and he uses the organization as a means to gain the power he needs to exact his vengeance. The newly transformed Shigeru escapes from the Black Satan headquarters before they can brainwash him, and becomes Kamen Rider Stronger. Shortly after his escape, Stronger meets Yuriko Misaki, another cyborg soldier created by Black Satan who can transform into Electro-Wave Human Tackle. Together they combat Black Satan and later the Delza Army, to restore peace in Japan. During a battle against the Delza Army, Tackle sacrifices herself to protect Stronger, and Stronger performs a special procedure on himself to achieve his "Charge-Up Form". Later, the six previous Kamen Riders return to Japan and join Stronger to finally topple the evil Delza Army.

Characters
 /Kamen Rider Stronger is the protagonist and eponymous character of the series. When he transforms into his rider form, he shouts "Henshin... Stronger!". In episode 31, he gains the ability to power up into a new "Charge Up" form after undergoing surgery. However, he has to use this power up in less than a minute or else he'll explode.
  is the first attempt at a female Kamen Rider. She was to be used by Black Satan like Shigeru, but was saved by him while he was trying to find a way out of Black Satan's secret lair. After some talk, he convinced her to come with him and together with a good friend to many Kamen Riders, Tobei Tachibana they fought Black Satan as Kamen Rider Stronger and the Electro-Wave Human Tackle for quite some time. Over time, Yuriko fell in love with Shigeru, but sadly, in episode 30, she gave her life to defeat the evil Doctor Kate in order to save him from being poisoned.
