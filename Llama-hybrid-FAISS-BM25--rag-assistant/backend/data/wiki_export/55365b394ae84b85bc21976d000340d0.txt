History

Foundation and early history
The history of Atletico Marte started at the end of the 1940s, when the San Salvadorian team España FC was dissolved.

Emilio Guardado and Carlos Carranza, leaders of the recent dissolved España FC, called a meeting with the players that remained of this team and others in the capital city of San Salvador to give life to another club called Alacranes F.C.

After a year playing under the name of Alacranes F.C., club president Colonel José Castro Melendez called a meeting at the old national gymnasium, and at the initiative of the player Conrado Miranda, it was decided to change the club name to Atletico Marte.

The club was officially born on the 2 June 1950 by the combination of military-related members such as José Castro Melendez, Fidel Quintanilla and Jesús Rodríguez and the general public such as Emilio Guardado, José Santiago Avelar and Armando Carranza.

The original uniform colors were ochre and beige, however with the passage of time the colors were changed to the current blue and white.

One of the most significant events of Atetico Marte was a 2–0 triumph on the home turf of Deportivo Saprissa, the first time a Salvadorian club had defeated a Costa Rican side on the opponent's home turf. The goals were scored by Gustavo "el Bordador" Lucha y Raúl Peña.
