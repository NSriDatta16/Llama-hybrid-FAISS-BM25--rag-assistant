He wrote of his experiences in the 2006 book Life, Happiness... and Cancer: Survive with action and attitude! (). The book continues (at 2020) to sell in bulk to cancer support NGO's and others who distribute the work to new patients to help them potentially arehieve better outcomes from their treatments. The book was published in Australia in 2008 and in Africa and Poland in 2010, each through different publishers. It was later published in paperback in Australia by Fontaine Press, and as an e-book through Amazon.com in 2013.

Kerslake gave talks to cancer patients, cancer support professionals and medical professionals mainly throughout New Zealand, on the use of psychosocial (mind-body-spirit) support measures to help patients cope with their experiences.
