History
The original Chatham Borough High School on Fairmount Avenue adjacent to the Chatham train station in Chatham Borough is a historic early twentieth century Gothic Revival building that still bears the name on its façade. Secondary level students from Chatham Township were bused to it and later to a senior high school on Main Street until 1966 under the auspices of the former Chatham Board of Education.

From 1966 through 1988, Chatham Township students attended the newly constructed Chatham Township High School on Lafayette Avenue, the building that is now used as the unified Chatham High School. Chatham Borough students attended the old Chatham High School, renamed Chatham Borough High School. The team names of Chatham Township High School was the Gladiators and the team name of Chatham Borough High School was the Eskies. The two schools were strong rivals at Homecoming games for the 22 years that they were separate high schools. Today the school mascot for the combined Chatham High School is the Cougar.

The new regional high school, serving both municipalities, was dedicated at Lafayette Avenue after the creation of the School District of the Chathams on July 1, 1988, and joined the Lafayette Elementary School on its original site. The two schools share performing arts facilities. The former Chatham Borough High School became Chatham Middle School, serving grades 6–8.

The school and several students were featured in the PBS program Frontline in 2008 for an episode related to a generation growing up with the internet.

During the 2007–08 school year, Chatham High School stopped giving midterm exams. Instead of midterm exams, students must complete alternate assessment projects, a move strongly supported by co-principal Michael LaSusa and backed by the School District of the Chathams. However, according to student poll data, a majority of students do not support the changes and would like to revert to midterms again. This policy continued into the 2008–09 school year. Currently, most classes have three more heavily weighted exams or assignments at the end of each third of the school year, although the student transcripts continue to report quarterly.
