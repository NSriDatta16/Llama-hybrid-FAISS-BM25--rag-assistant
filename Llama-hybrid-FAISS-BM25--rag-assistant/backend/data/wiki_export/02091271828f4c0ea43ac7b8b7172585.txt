Sphenocephalus (from  , 'wedge' and   'head') is an extinct genus of ray-finned fish that lived during the Cretaceous period. Fossils have been found in England and Italy.

Sphenocephalus was about  long, with a rather large head, and may have resembled a modern black bass in appearance. It was one of the earliest fish to have the pelvic fins placed beneath th pectoral fins, a common feature in modern fish that improves swimming manoeuvrability. Like the modern trout-perches, it possessed a mixture of modern and primitive features, and it was probably one of the earliest perciform fish.
