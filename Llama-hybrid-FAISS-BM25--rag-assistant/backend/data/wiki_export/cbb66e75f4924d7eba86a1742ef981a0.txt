In 1948–49, Pilous led the San Diego Skyhawks to the Pacific Coast Hockey League title.

After the PCHL, Pilous returned to the team he founded in St. Catharines, now known as the St. Catharines Teepees. He coached the team to a Memorial Cup championship in the 1954 Memorial Cup. He was its general manager for the 1960 Memorial Cup victory.

Pilous coached the Chicago Black Hawks from 1958 to 1963. In the 1961 Stanley Cup Finals, he led the Hawks to Stanley Cup victory. Between 1956 and 1968, he was the only coach to win the Stanley Cup other than Toe Blake and Punch Imlach.

After a brief stint with the Hamilton Red Wings, Pilous was hired to be the initial general manager of the expansion Oakland Seals in 1967.
