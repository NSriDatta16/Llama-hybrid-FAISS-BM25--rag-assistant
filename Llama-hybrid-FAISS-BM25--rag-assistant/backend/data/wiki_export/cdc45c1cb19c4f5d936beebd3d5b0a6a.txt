Anchor Island () is an island in Dusky Sound in Fiordland.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of "large hill" for .

The island is situated southwest of the much larger Resolution Island in the inlet area of Dusky Sound and surrounded by many smaller islands and contains four small lakes, including Lake Kirirua, the largest lake on an island in Fiordland.

The island is part of the Fiordland National Park and since 2005 is one of few island sanctuaries that are home to the critically endangered kakapo (or night parrot).

Red deer and stoats had been eradicated between 2001 and 2005, and subsequently endangered endemic birds including tieke (saddleback), mohua (yellowhead) and kakapo, have been relocated to the island. The island is one of only nine islands in the area that is completely free of introduced mammalian pests and is  from the New Zealand mainland, which makes it relatively safe from repeat incursions by stoat and deer.

Anchor Island is one of the predator free islands as part of the Fiordland Islands restoration programme, the programmes focus is to eradicate pests and translocate native species.

Kākāpō 
Pukenui is home to the endangered species kākāpō. The first kākāpō were transferred to Pukenui in 2005 after stoat eradication in 2001. These birds are managed by the Kākāpō Recovery Team, which is a part of the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

Pukenui has rimu forest, an important food source for the species.

The first known breeding of kākāpō on Pukenui occurred in 2011, leading to two infertile eggs. Kākāpō breed again on the island for the 2016 and 2019 kākāpō breeding seasons. As of 23 January 2022, all mature female kākāpō on the island have bred. Nests have been found for 17 of the 21 birds.
