Brio is a Slovenian pay TV channel targeting female viewers 18â€“34. It was launched by Pro Plus as Pop Brio in September 2010 and replaced the former TV Pika.

Brio was a part of the first Slovenian subscription package, Pop Non Stop, which launched in September 2011. The package offered six channels: Pop Kino, Pop Kino2, Pop Brio, Pop Fani, Pop Oto, and Pop Spot. 

In 2013, the package was discontinued along with the Pop Kino2, Pop Fani, and Pop Spot channels; the remaining three channels became free-to-view channels.

In 2014, Pop Brio became known as Brio.
