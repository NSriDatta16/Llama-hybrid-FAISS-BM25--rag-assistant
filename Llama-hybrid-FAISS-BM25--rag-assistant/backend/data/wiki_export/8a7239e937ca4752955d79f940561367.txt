The Ontario Young Liberals (OYL) is the official youth wing of the Ontario Liberal Party. The OYL's membership includes all members of the Ontario Liberal Party who are aged 25 and under. The organization has local branches called "student clubs" (associations of members at post secondary institutions) and "riding clubs" (associations of members residing in electoral districts), though members are not required to be associated with any such clubs. It is led by a 16-member executive board.

Until the end of 2016, the OYL was also recognized by the Liberal Party of Canada as its youth wing in Ontario. In 2017, federal party ceased recognition of its element organizations that are jointly recognized provincial liberal parties. A separate Ontario "section" of the Young Liberals of Canada was created to serve as its youth organization in Ontario.

History

Associations of liberal partisans on university and college campus existed prior to the 1970s, and were loosely affiliated with the party each other through the Ontario Student Liberals. In 1971, the organization was formally established as the Ontario New Liberals and was known as such until the mid-1980s.

The organization has been a grooming ground for budding politicians and political organizers. Many elected officials and partisan with public prominence were active members of the OYL in their youth. These include:
Yvan Baker, MP and former MPP for Etobicoke Centre
Arnold Chan, Former MP for Scarborough—Agincourt
Bonnie Crombie, Mayor of Mississauga and former MP for Mississauga—Streetsville (served on as Student Director of the OYL)
Steven Del Duca, Former leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, former MPP for Vaughan and Ontario Minister of Transportation (served as President of the University of Toronto Liberals)
Dwight Duncan, Former MPP for Windsor—Tecumseh and Ontario Finance Minister (served on the executive of the OYL and contested its presidency)
Michael Ignatieff, Former leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and former MP for Etobicoke-Lakeshore (served as a staff youth organizer in the national headquarters)
Rob Oliphant, MP for Don Valley West (served on the executive of the OYL)
Ruby Dhalla, Former MP for Brampton—Springdale (served on the national executive of Young Liberals of Canada)

Influence
Since the Liberal Party allocates specific number of delegate spots for campus liberal associations at its national convention, key players of the OYL wielded unique influence in the party’s leadership selection as it has the largest number of campus associations under its jurisdiction.  OYL had been a fierce battleground during federal leadership races from the early 80s to 2006.  The Paul Martin leadership campaign was particularly notorious for hostile take over of campus liberal associations leading up to the 1990 and 2003 contests.

The OYL executive is made up of 17 OYL members elected to one-year terms by the membership at the OYL Annual General Meeting.

Regions

The OYL recognizes eight distinct regions of the province. Each region is represented by a Regional Coordinator. Each region is further broken down by areas, although these area divisions are seldom used. The eight regions are: Northern Region, Eastern Region, Ottawa Region, Golden Horseshoe Region, GTA Central region, GTA East Region, GTA North Region, and Southwest Region.

Affiliated clubs

The OYL is composed of riding and student clubs. Riding clubs are based in each provincial electoral district. Student clubs are located at universities and colleges in Ontario.

Each club has a constitution, which must agree with the constitutions of the Ontario Liberal Party and the OYL. Each club has an executive, and conducts activities such as community outreach, social events, policy meetings and assists in campaigns during federal or provincial elections.

OYL Annual General Meeting

The executive of the OYL is elected to a one-year term at the Annual General Meeting of the OYL. The AGM is never held in the same region twice in a row.

OYL Summer Fling

In the summer of 2002, the OYL created a new signature event called Summer Fling, which was held at Wilfrid Laurier University the inaugural year. OYL Summer Fling includes a volunteer appreciation dinner, the annual policy conference and many guest speakers. It has quickly become the flagship event of the OYL.
