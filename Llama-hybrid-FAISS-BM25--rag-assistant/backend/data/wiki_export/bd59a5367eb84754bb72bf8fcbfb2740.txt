History
The school was established in December 1962. Before then, students attended Andrew Sibbald School. Andrew Sibbald School was reserved for grades 1â€“9. Because the school was unable to house the influx of students, grade 12 students were forced to attend Mount Royal College to complete their senior matriculation. As the population of Cochrane increased, the need to build a suitable high school was approved by the Board of Cochrane School district.

In December 1962, students were moved to a new building. On January 1, 1966, the schools in Cochrane became a part of Calgary Rural School Division #41 (later to become Rocky View School Division #41). New additions to the building included a home Economics room, Industrial Arts room, Biology lab, library and typing room to conclude projects for the school in the 1960s. In subsequent years, full renovations occurred such a new gymnasium, a separate wing for the Junior High, library expansion, new science labs, a drama room, cafeteria/student lounge area and a transformation of administrative areas (including guidance offices).
