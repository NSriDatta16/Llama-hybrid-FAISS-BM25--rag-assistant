Regent House School is a co-educational, controlled grammar school in Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland. It comprises two parts: the preparatory department, known as "the Prep", and the main school itself. It has over 1420 pupils from ages 4 to 18.

The school is divided into four houses: Castlereagh, Strangford, Scrabo and Clandeboye.

Inspections

The school was inspected by the Controlled Schools' Support Council in 2015 and judged Satisfactory. In 2019 another inspection was carried out, but could not reach a judgement because of industrial action being taken by staff.
