History

The site of Mill Springs National Cemetery was originally the battlefield cemetery of the Battle of Mill Springs, Sunday 19 January 1862, initially designated Logan's Cross Roads Cemetery. Soldiers who fell in the battle were buried in large trenches. After the Civil War, it became an official National Cemetery and had its name changed. Many battlefield cemeteries in the region had their remains transferred to Mill Springs.

In 1867, additional land was donated to the federal government for the cemetery by William H. Logan; he and his wife were buried in the cemetery upon their deaths.

Mill Springs National Cemetery was on the list of the first National Cemeteries created. As small as it is, the cemetery still receives burials. It is one of the  oldest  National Cemeteries still in operation.
