The International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA) is an umbrella scientific organization of national and multinational Anatomy Associations, dedicated to anatomy and biomorphological sciences.

Origins and objectives
In 1903, Prof. Nicolas, from Nancy, France, was successful in founding the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists.

The first International Congress of Anatomy was held in Geneva in 1905 and started as a committee to organize five yearly conferences.

56 member Associations of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists. The IFAA is the only international body representing all aspects of anatomy and anatomical associations.

Since 1989 the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FICAT) under IFAA auspices, has met to analyze and study the international morphological terminology (Anatomy, Histology and Embryology), releasing updated Terminologia Anatomica in 1998 and Terminologia Histologica in 2008.
