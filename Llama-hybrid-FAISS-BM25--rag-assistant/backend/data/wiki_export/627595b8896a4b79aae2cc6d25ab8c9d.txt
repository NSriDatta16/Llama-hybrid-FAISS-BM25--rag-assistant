Badin Lake is one of a series of lakes created by the damming of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River in the Uwharrie Lakes Region of the United States. The Badin Lake Dam was built in 1917 to support local aluminum smelting plant, Alcoa, and the associated community of Badin was named for the founder, Adrien Badin. The power generation unit was sold to Cube Hydro Carolinas in February 2017. Badin Lake is in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. It is contained by Narrows Dam at the town of Badin, North Carolina. Sitting within a valley, the lake is very deep, with a maximum depth of 190 ft (58 m).  The lake occupies  and has 115 mi (185 km) of shoreline.  Its waters have an average summer temperature of 84.4 °F (29.1 °C) and an average winter temperature of 50.6 °F (10.3 °C). No ferries cross Badin Lake. The northernmost point of Morrow Mountain State Park is roughly  downstream from Narrows Dam. The lake lies within Stanly, Davidson, Montgomery, and Rowan counties.  Much of the lake's eastern shoreline lies within the Uwharrie National Forest.
