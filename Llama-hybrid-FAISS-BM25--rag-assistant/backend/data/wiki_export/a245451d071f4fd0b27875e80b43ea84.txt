"Just One More Kiss", "Iconoclasm" and "Taboo" were later re-recorded for the compilation album Koroshi no Shirabe: This Is Not Greatest Hits (1992). "Iconoclasm" was covered by J for the Buck-Tick tribute album, Parade -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick- (2005). Taboo peaked at number one on the Oricon charts, selling 298,620 copies in the first year, and at least 300,000 in total.

Production 
The band recorded the album in London in the fall of 1988, the producer was Owen Paul. They also had a gig at the Greyhound Club, which the members of Der Zibet also attended. London made a lasting impression on Buck-Tick, especially Sakurai Atsushi, who felt that the local music scene was more accepting of darker, more serious music than the Japanese one. The album marks a turn in the band's career towards a darker style.
