Plot
The story is about several friends who run a detective company, named Soh & Co, in an old storeroom behind Alvin Soh's mother's jewelry shop. A large sign hangs outside proudly proclaiming:

                                       
                                         SOH & CO
                                      INVESTIGATORS
                                 We investigate anything
                              No case too big or too small

They are frequently roped into solving crimes that baffle the police by their suspicious clients, frowned upon by their friend in the police, Sergeant Soo, as well as Alvin's mother, Gracie Soh. They are both worried about safety since Alvinâ€™s father was murdered.

Characters

Main characters
Alvin Soh: He is the main protagonist in Mr. Mystery. He lives with his mother, Gracie Soh. His gel-slicked hair is always cut very short at the sides, which seems to make his ears stick out. In The Mystery of the Sydney Slayings, he learns that his father was murdered by The Snake.
Tan Wei Ling: She has a collection of criminal files in their headquarters. She became jealous when Alvin became close to Tai, The Snake's daughter. She has a prominent beauty spot. She always wears white tee and jeans. In The Mystery of the Unlucky Undertaker, Wei Ling has a new boyfriend, Tony Hall. In The Mystery of the Bolting Burglar, it is hinted that she might have a new boyfriend called Tomas.
Rafferty "Rafe" Lim: He is Alvin's best friend and his senior investigator. He is so handsome that he looks like a member of a boy band. He is also Mars Wong's boyfriend. In The Mystery of the Rajah's Ruby, it is revealed that he can fly a plane.
Mars Wong: She is a beautiful girl and is Rafe's girlfriend. She is close to Tan Wei Ling and Sabrina Sim, a girl who is not an investigator. She is the one who found out Tai is actually The Snake's daughter. Before she started dating Rafe, she had a boyfriend, Edmund Lim (The Mystery of the Eagle's Eye).
Azizul: He always wears a cap. Azizul enjoys teasing Wei Ling just to see her beauty spot bob up and down. He has a girlfriend, Farisha, but she is not an investigator. Fishing is his favourite hobby.
Sinchita: Sinchita can draw very well. She has a cat, Kuching. Sinchita believes relationships do not last long, just like what happened to her father and mother. In The Mystery of the Seventh Sword, she is unintentionally poisoned by The Snake, after she cut her finger with the poisoned envelope meant for Alvin, slipping into a coma. In the next book, The Mystery of the Missing Murderer, she died, leaving five investigators in the team.
Tony Hall: Tony likes to surf. He became Wei Ling's boyfriend in The Mystery of the Unlucky Undertaker. He is very patient and always holds up for Alvin. He becomes part of the group in The Mystery of the Clueless Corpse. Tony has not appeared since The Mystery of the Murdered Maid when he went back to America, meaning that he might have left the group permanently.
Arpeeta: Arpeeta is Sinchita's little sister and has waited a long time to join Alvin's group of investigators. She first appears, and becomes part of the group, in The Mystery of the Clownish Corpse. She is shown to have a good singing voice (The Mystery of the Christmas Carol), and also writes poetry (The Mystery of the Bothered Brother).
