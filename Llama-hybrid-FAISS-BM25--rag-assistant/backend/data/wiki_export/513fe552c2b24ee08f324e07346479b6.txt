Jason Figgis is an Irish film director known for his work on a variety of projects ranging from documentaries to horror films. He was born in Ranelagh, Dublin, and attended St. Mary’s College in Rathmines before studying art at Ballyfermot Senior College in Dublin. After working for Murakami-Wolf Animation Studios and Steven Spielberg's Amblimation Studios, Figgis studied business and worked in communications dealer accounts management before setting up his own film production company, October Eleven Pictures.

Figgis directed his first feature film, The Twilight Hour, in collaboration with photographer Simon Marsden in 2003. The documentary feature project, narrated by John Hurt, was acquired by the Discovery Network and distributed to 100 countries in 2004. Figgis was then invited by BSkyB to join them as a director, and he directed several feature projects, including Uri's Haunted Cities: Venice and A Maverick In London.

In addition to his work with BSkyB, Figgis set up Teen Feature Film Project Ireland and Feature Film Project Ireland, directing three feature projects that went on to worldwide distribution through Pop Twist Studios and MVD Entertainment Group. He also directed two horror films, Don't You Recognise Me? and Torment, both of which were multi-award winning/nominated.

In 2018, Figgis formed a film partnership with journalist and broadcaster John West, called Figgis-West. Their first joint production was the haunted house feature, The Ghost of Winifred Meeks, which was distributed by Bayview Entertainment and Pinewood Studios High Fliers Films. Several other feature projects have followed in quick succession, including Maverick, the official look at the history of the celebrated King's Head Theatre in London, and Colin Wilson: His Life and Work, the official biographical series of films looking at the incredible body of work of the English philosopher and writer. Figgis also restored the classic German horror film Nosferatu and commissioned a new score from composer Hugh Doolan in 2022 to mark the centenary of the film. Their version of the restoration was selected for the International Vampire Film and Arts Festival and by Element Pictures for distribution through their cinemas Lighthouse and Palas during the centenary year.

Figgis has also worked on several documentary projects, including Simon Marsden: A Life in Pictures, and Shirley Baker: Life Through a Lens. He has designed covers and written forewords for several books, including Britain's Haunted Heritage and Britain's Ghostly Heritage, both authored by John West, as well as The Battle of Gainsborough 1643 and In Search of Roman Lincoln.
