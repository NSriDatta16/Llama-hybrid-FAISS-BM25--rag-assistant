Career
James won the International South German Championship in 1985, the International German Grand Prix in 1986, and the 1986 New York State Championship All Junior Category. He stopped training because he was not eligible to join the German Nationals since he did not hold German citizenship but made a comeback in 1990 after he left Germany.

The first National Physique Committee (NPC) competition of James was the NPC Junior USA of 1996, where he placed 13th. In 1999, he competed in his first Night of Champions, where he tied 14th. The following year, in 2000, he competed in his first Arnold Classic, placing 4th.

His first Mr. Olympia was in 2000 as well, where he placed 11th. He has competed in a total of seven Mr. Olympias, with his highest placing coming in 4th in 2003.

In 2010, James said that the 2010 Mr. Olympia would be his last competition. He also said that he had lied about his age in the past and that he will be "45 years old soon".

He announced the end of his competitive career in 2012. He has continued to train and mentor other bodybuilders.
