"Alone in My Room" is a song by Ami Suzuki, released as her second single in September 1998.

Information
"Alone in My Room", like Ami's first single, "Love the Island", was used by the Japanese Government to promote winter tourism on the island of Guam. The song was also used multiple times as the opening theme of ASAYAN, a television show.

The complete single, including all its tracks, were creations of Ami's music mastermind in the Sony days, Tetsuya Komuro. Two of the remixes bear the initials T.K. because of this.

The single was the first one released by Ami in Maxi Single format, including more than three songs on it. The maxi CD was housed in a J-card-type 12 cm slimline single case. The case used was 7 mm thick, showing artwork through the front, and also through the spine and part of the back of the case. The CD itself was inserted upside-down, allowing the artwork on the disc itself to show through the transparent back of the case. The CD also included an obi that advertised Suzuki's previous single.

Following her blacklisting from the music industry in September 2000, production and distribution of the single stopped in its entirety.
