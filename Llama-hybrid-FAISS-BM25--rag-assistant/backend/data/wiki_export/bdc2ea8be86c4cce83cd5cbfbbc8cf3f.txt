Controversies

2020-2022 Racial Discrimination Controversy
In May of 2020 a video began circulating showing a DHS student, and son of DHS IB coordinator and instructional coach Cheryl Nahamias, holding a toy gun, using racial slurs and threatening black DHS students. Cheryl Nahamias was demoted and reassigned to a job in CSD's central offices after defending her sons actions. In December of 2020 Cheryl Nahamias, who is white, filed a racial discrimination suit against City Schools of Decatur, stating through her attorney that "[I] believe the City Schools of Decatur has violated Dr. Nahmias' civil, constitutional, and educational privacy rights. We intend to prove that [Superintendent David] Dude and his administration have created a work environment that is hostile to legally protected speech and whistleblowers. ... We intend to hold CSD and its administrators accountable for this egregious conduct.". In January of 2022 it was reported that CSD settled with Cheryl Nahamias out of court and agreed to pay her three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

Football Spectator Misconduct
At a Football game played in late August 2022 against Flowery Branch High School Decatur High School students spat on members of the Flowery Branch High School band, pulled feathers from the hats of members of the FBHS band and sexually harassed the FBHS majorettes. Additionally students from DHS consumed alcohol and drugs, got into fights, and vandalized the stadium. These events resulted in DHS implementing a new suite of policies intended to curb student misconduct at sporting events; including banning students from standing on the benches, increasing supervision of the event by members of the school staff and disallowing students from bringing bags into stadiums.
