He became udaijin (Minister of the Right) in 1021. Sanesuke had a thorough knowledge of customs and rites, so he was called Kenjin Ufu (賢人右府) (wise Udaijin).

He wrote the diary Shōyūki (小右記) for fifty years. He died at the age of 90.

In it, she praises him for being out of the ordinary, and describes in detail a number of occasions of his superstitious behavior.
