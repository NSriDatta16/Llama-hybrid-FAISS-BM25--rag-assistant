Parnon or Parnonas () or Malevos (Μαλεβός) is a mountain range, or massif, on the east of the Laconian plain and the Evrotas valley. It is visible from Athens above the top of the Argive mountains. The western part is in the Laconia prefecture and the northeastern part is in the Arcadia prefecture. The Parnon range separates Laconia from Arcadia. Its summit offers panoramic views of southeastern Arcadia and South Kynouria and much of Laconia that includes the northern and the central portions and reaches as far as the Taygetos mountains.  It also views a part of the central Arcadia and the southern Argolis prefectures.  It views the Myrtoan and the Laconian Gulfs.

Geography

Physical

The Parnon Massif is divided into three parts. The northernmost, which is the highest, runs  from just north of Ano Doliana in North Kynouria, eastern Arcadia, southeast to Platanaki Pass. Platanaki, ancient Glyppia, is on the ancient route from Therapnes to South Kynouria between the peaks of Parnon, , and Psaris, . Altitudes on the north rise from  to  increasing toward the peak to  to  with a tree line at . Below it are forests of Black Pine and fir; above it, grasslands.

Between the pass and Kounoupia to the south is  of central Parnon, lower in altitude than the northern. The remaining , even lower in altitude but still mountainous, runs from Kounouria to the sea at Epidaurus Limera, which is in Monemvasia. Parnon proper does not extend into the Malea Peninsula.

In addition to the range of Parnon, two forelands can also be defined, east and west. Kynouria is located in the east foreland. In the west two lengths can be distinguished: from the northern flank of Parnon to Gkoritsa in Therapnes (on the road to Platanaki Pass), which is  to , and southward into the Malea Peninsula,  to  wide.
