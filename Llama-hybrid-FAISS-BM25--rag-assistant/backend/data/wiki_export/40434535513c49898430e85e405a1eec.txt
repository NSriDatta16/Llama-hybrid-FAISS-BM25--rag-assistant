Gimcrack (1760 â€“ after 1777) was an English thoroughbred racehorse.

Background
Gimcrack was a small gray Thoroughbred, standing at  and sired by Cripple, a son of the Godolphin Arabian; his dam, Miss Elliot, was by (Grisewood's) Partner. Lady Sarah Lennox wrote of Gimcrack in a letter dated to 12 July 1765:

Racing career
Despite his small stature, Gimcrack was widely successful, winning 27 of his 36 races in a turf career spanning 7 seasons. His ownership changed hands a few times, being owned by Frederick St John, 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke before being resold to Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet, who owned Gimcrack from 1768 to 1769. He was resold again to Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor, as Bunbury was unhappy with Gimcrack's racing performance later in his career.

Gimcrack won his last race in 1771, at age 11, and he retired to the Grosvenor stud.

Stud record
Gimcrack sired the handy grey horse, Grey Robin who defeated Pot-8-os. His bloodline was more notable though in US horse racing than in Britain, via his son, Medley.

After his death he was buried at Haughton Hall in Shifnal, Shropshire. A brick and stone pillar marks his grave to the west of the old walled garden.

Legacy
Gimcrack is best known from the paintings of George Stubbs.

The Gimcrack Club, in York was founded in 1766 in his honour, and the Gimcrack Stakes, also at York, is therefore also named after the horse.
