Hard Rock Live, formerly known as Etess Arena,  is a multi-purpose arena in Atlantic City, New Jersey located at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City. Originally opening in April 1990 as a part of the Trump Taj Mahal, the arena seats over 5,000 for music and sporting events.

About
The arena was named after Mark Grossinger Etess, a former president and COO of Trump Plaza, who perished in an October 1989 helicopter crash.

Despite the Indian theme of the Trump Taj Mahal, the Etess Arena was contemporary, based upon the club scene in England.

The venue's first concert performance was by Elton John on May 18, 1990. Donald Trump was originally in negotiations to have Madonna open the venue during her Blond Ambition World Tour but plans fell through. Her first concert in Atlantic City came 16 years later with her Confessions Tour, which was held at the Boardwalk Hall.

As part of the hotel casino complex's sale to the Seminole Tribe of Florida which rebuilt it as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City, it reopened on June 29, 2018. Boxing and mixed martial arts matches are held in the arena.
