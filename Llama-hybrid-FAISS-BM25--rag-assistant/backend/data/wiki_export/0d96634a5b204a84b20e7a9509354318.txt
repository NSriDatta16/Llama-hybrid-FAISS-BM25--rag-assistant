Petar Stojanović (7 September 1877 – 11 September 1957) was a Serbian violinist and composer of operettas, ballets and orchestral music. (His birthday is also variously given as 6 September and 25 August.)

Life 
He was born in Budapest and studied the violin there with Jenő Hubay. At the Vienna Conservatory, he studied violin with Jakob Grün and composition with Robert Fuchs and Richard Heuberger. In 1925, he became professor of violin in Belgrade, where he lived until his death. A music college in the town of Ub is named after him.
