History
The settlement of Mossâmedes began as a village for the Indian tribes of Naundós, Acroás, and Caiapós in 1755.  Its first name was São José de Mossâmedes in honor of the Captain-General Dom José de Almeida Soveral de Carvalho, Governor of the Capitania of Goiás, who was from the village of Mossâmedes in Portugal.  From 1770 to 1774 the village went through a complete restructure due to its near disappearance due to the Indians' inability to adapt to life there.  Damiana da Cunha, granddaughter of the chief of the Caiapós was instrumental in converting the Indians.  In 1780 the village was designated a freguesia with the name of São José de Mossâmedes.  In 1781, due to the continuing evasion of the Indians, another group of 800 Javaés and Carajás was brought from the Ilha do Bananal.  In 1845 Mossâmedes became a district, belonging to Itaberaí.  In 1890 it was a district of  Goiás, the territorial capital.  Finally in 1938 it was raised to municipal status as Mossâmedes.  Source: Sepin
