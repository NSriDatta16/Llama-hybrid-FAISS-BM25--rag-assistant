Caliente is the name of the first album recorded by the Argentine rock band Vox Dei, issued in 1970, their only LP for "Mandioca".

The band had recorded for "Mandioca" two singles between 1969 and 1970.
During the sessions for the next album, La Biblia, Vox Dei still were contractually attached to this label, which went bust in late 1970, and the label "Disc Jockey" took over of the production of the next four albums.

Also, here appears the first version of "Presente", the second version (more famous) appears on Cuero Caliente (1972).
