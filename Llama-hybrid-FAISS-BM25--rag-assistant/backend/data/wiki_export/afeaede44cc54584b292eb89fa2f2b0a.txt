Baron Gardner, of Uttoxeter, is a dormant title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Sir Alan Gardner, an Admiral of the Blue and former Member of Parliament for Plymouth and Westminster. In 1806, he was also created Baron Gardner, of Uttoxeter in the County of Stafford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Baron, was also an Admiral in the Royal Navy. In 1815, it was announced that he was to be created a viscount, but Lord Gardner died before the patent had passed the Great Seal.

He was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. He was a Whig politician and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1837 to 1841. On his death in 1883 the peerages became dormant. They were claimed by Alan Gardner, grandson of the second son of the first Baron, who styled himself "Lord Gardner", but neither he nor any other male-line descendant have been able to prove their claim to the titles satisfactorily. It has been suggested by William Dalrymple that the current heir to the barony is from the Gardner family of Khasgunge (now Kasganj), Uttar Pradesh, India.

Another member of the Gardner family was the Liberal politician Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere. He was the illegitimate son of the third Baron Gardner.
