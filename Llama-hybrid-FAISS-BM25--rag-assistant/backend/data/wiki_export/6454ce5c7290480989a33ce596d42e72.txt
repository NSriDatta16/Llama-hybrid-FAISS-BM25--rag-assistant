"I'm Ready for Love" is a 1966 single by Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas. The song, produced and written by Holland–Dozier–Holland, and was written in a similar style to The Supremes' smash hit, "You Can't Hurry Love".

Background
The Vandellas' version was issued as the first official release off the group's 1966 album, Watchout!, though the album's actual first single, the emotive ballad "What Am I Going to Do Without Your Love" bombed on the chart. This song renewed the Vandellas' popularity among mainstream audiences with its top ten showing.

Cash Box said that it is a "hard driving rocker has the girls spilling out a potent, effective romance lyric in a mood that should have every dancer who spins the disk on the floor."

Chart performance
Scoring their biggest hit since "Nowhere to Run", rose to #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on Billboards Hot R&B singles chart. "I'm Ready For Love" was also a chart hit for the group in the UK where the song peaked at number twenty-two on the chart.

Other recordings
Other than the Vandellas, The Temptations also recorded a version of this song that was released on their 1967 album In A Mellow Mood.
