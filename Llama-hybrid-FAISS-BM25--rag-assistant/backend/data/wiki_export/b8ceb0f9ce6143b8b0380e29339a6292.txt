Tin Hau () is an area in Wan Chai District, on the north side of Hong Kong Island, in Hong Kong.

Tin Hau is not a formalised district in Hong Kong, but rather Causeway Bay proper. The colloquial name arose from Tin Hau station, so named due to its proximity to the Causeway Bay Tin Hau Temple; and as the use of the name Causeway Bay shifts eastwards due to Causeway Bay Tram Terminus and later Causeway Bay station.

The term "Tin Hau" is also used to describe the location of places like Queen's College (beside Tin Hau MTR station) and the Central Library and the Causeway Bay Sports Ground which is located in the Wan Chai District. Several government offices and facilities such as Causeway Bay Market are located there.
