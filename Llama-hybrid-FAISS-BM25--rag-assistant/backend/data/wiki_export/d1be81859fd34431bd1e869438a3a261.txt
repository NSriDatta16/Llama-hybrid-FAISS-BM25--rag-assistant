Hall STEAM Magnet High School, formerly Hall High School, is an accredited public high school located in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States. It is a part of the Little Rock School District (LRSD).

Prior to its conversion to an all magnet school in 2020, Hall was one of five comprehensive four-year public high schools in the LRSD enrolling students in grades nine through twelve.

History
Opened in late 1957 as the city's second white high school, Hall High School started with student body of about 700. It was named for Col. Robert Cleveland "R.C." Hall, Superintendent of the Little Rock School District from 1909 to 1941. As a result of the school opening, Little Rock High School was renamed to Little Rock Central High School.

In 2020 it became a magnet school only, with Little Rock Southwest High School taking its attendance boundary. That year it had grades 10-12 and had 401 students; it will get the 9th grade later.

Facilities
Hall's classic performing arts auditorium, the home of the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra from September 1972 to April 1973, still serves as a site for community events and performances. Hall High School received additions in 1962, 1963, 1971, 1975 and 1984.

The two newest buildings opened in 2003: a new classroom wing (Zone 8) and a new gymnasium/athletic center (officially named "Cirks Arena" in 2010 to honor George Cirks, basketball coach and dean of students). The Dietz Physical Development Center officially was dedicated in January 2005 and was named to honor Donald Dietz, a Hall High graduate and West Point alumnus who was killed in Vietnam in 1969.

Academics

Accreditation
Hall is accredited by AdvancED (formerly The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools) since 1958 and holds membership in the College Board. It remains one of only three Arkansas public schools admitted (1963) to the National Cum Laude Society, the high school equivalent of Phi Beta Kappa.

College coursework
At Hall High, college courses are offered through a partnership (University Studies) with the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR).  Currently, Hall offers 12 college courses, representing a total of 40 college credit hours. Also offered is Comp I, Comp II, Biology, Speech Communication, Intro to Sociology, Physics I, Physics II, US History I, US History II, Intro to Psychology, College Algebra, Evolutionary and Environmental Biology.

Students receive college credit (in addition to high school credit) for all of these courses. Students receive "grants-in-aid" from UALR which result in a 50% reduction in tuition costs. Textbooks are currently provided at no cost to students by the Little Rock School District. Additionally, professors from UALR are onsite with Hall teachers at the school.

Vocational training
Another unique program for Hall High in the LRSD, is the Cisco Academy. Internetworking Technologies is a four semester hands-on curriculum prescribed by the Cisco Systems. At the end of the fourth semester, students take a certification test which is recognized throughout the computer industry. This curriculum is open to 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students.
