History
The Diocese of Broken Bay was erected on 8 April 1986. Prior to this date, the area was considered within the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Sydney.

According to Roman Catholic Church records, in 1822 Governor Brisbane granted  land near Pittwater to Father Therry for the purposes of establishing a church. However, attempts to established a church in 1859 were postponed due to the sparcity of Catholics. A church at Manly was established in 1873 and another erected at Careel Bay in 1875. Manly was the site of the first parish that was established in the area in 1876; followed by Gosford (1888) and Pymble (1889). Together these three parishes covered most of the present diocese until 1910. By 1885, work on St Patrick's College, Manly had commenced and was completed in 1888.

The Diocese covers  and includes both bush and coastal communities. Symbolising the diocese is the lighthouse, based on the historic lighthouse at Barrenjoey.
