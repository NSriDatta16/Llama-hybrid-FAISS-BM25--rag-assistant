Yiorgos Depollas (born Athens 1947) is a Greek photographer. Alternative spellings of his name are Giorgos Depollas and George Depollas.

Depollas was one of the main figures of the New Greek Photography movement which promoted creative photography in Greece during the 1980s and 1990s, and he remains a highly influential presence. He has been active in both creative and professional photography since 1975, and has exhibited in Greece and abroad, including Britain, France, Italy, Germany and the USA. He was one of the five founders of the Photography Centre of Athens (PCA) in 1979. The PCA was the first Greek institution devoted to creative photography, and as such a seminal focus for photographers of next generations.
