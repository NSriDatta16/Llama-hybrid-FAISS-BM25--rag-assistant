Business Never Personal is the fourth studio album by hip hop duo EPMD. It was released on July 28, 1992, on Def Jam Recordings. Following mixed criticism of their previous studio effort, 1990's Business As Usual, the duo was able to return to their past acclaim on Business Never Personal. The lead single, "Crossover," became its biggest success, nearly reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is about keeping it real and not crossing over to the mainstream, but became EPMD's biggest mainstream success.

The duo cut "Head Banger" with Redman and K-Solo, and it was also a hit in 1992. The album was certified Gold in sales by the RIAA on October 13, 1992. The single "Crossover" was certified Gold on November 16, 1992. While it has yet to be reissued in the U.S., Business Never Personal was re-released in 2005 on vinyl in Europe.

Members Erick Sermon and Parrish Smith began having money troubles during recording, which led to a 1992 robbery of Smith's home. The perpetrators claimed that Erick Sermon paid them to do the deed, causing the group to break up soon after this release. They each released two solo albums between 1993 and 1996, then reunited as a duo in 1997.

Critical reception

The album is considered the duo's third classic by fans and critics. The record was given a rating of 4.5 mics out of 5 in The Source in 1992.

The Washington Post wrote: "Zapp member Roger Troutman's sampled, synthesized voice is looped with the chorus of the bumping current hit 'Crossover,' EPMD's attack on rappers who 'sell their souls to go gold' while slinking bass propels 'Play the Next Man,' which finds Sermon and Smith slamming manipulative women."
