Lost & Found (1961–62) is a Beach Boys compilation album which was released in 1991 under DCC Compact Classics record company. The album contains all of the early recordings of the band before they were signed to their first major record label, Capitol Records. This release is notable to collectors as it uses the original master tapes, where as many countless gray market issues of the same material use inferior sources.  This release was compiled and mastered by Steve Hoffman. Original recordings were produced by Hite Morgan in 1961 & 1962.
