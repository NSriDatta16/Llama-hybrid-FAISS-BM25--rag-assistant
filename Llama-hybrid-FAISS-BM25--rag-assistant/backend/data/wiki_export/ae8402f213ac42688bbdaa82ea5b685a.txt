WIOO (1000 AM), known as "Country Gold FM & AM", WIOO is a commercial AM radio station licensed to serve Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The call sign stands for the station's former long-time branding, "W-100," referring to its position on the AM dial. WIOO has aired a "country gold" format for the past 21 years, playing country music from approximately 5â€“50 years ago. The station is affiliated with Westwood One, and with Motor Racing Network, and Performance Racing Network for extensive NASCAR coverage.

WIOO is a "daytimer", broadcasting at full power from local sunrise to local sunset, and at reduced power from local sunset until 45 minutes later (during "critical hours"), after which it signs off to protect clear channel station WMVP in Chicago from skywave interference. The station's programming is simulcast 24 hours a day on FM translators 97.9 W250AP and 107.3 W297CO both in Carlisle. WIOO also simulcasts the majority of its programming on translator 93.9 W230AX, licensed to serve Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.

WIOO airs local news in Cumberland County, provides the noonday Tradio show for listener call ins each day as part of its one-hour news and information block, and carries live sports including locally produced Cumberland Valley Eagles football on the Carlisle frequencies and Shippensburg Greyhounds football on FM 93.9. The station carries major college and NFL football, NASCAR and Baltimore Orioles baseball during respective seasons.

History
WIOO signed on the air in 1965 and played contemporary music for most of its history. During the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s, it was a successful Top 40 station which, despite being a daytimer, competed with Harrisburg stations WKBO and WFEC for the teenage audience.

WIOO has a long-standing history of morning personalities dating back to the mid-1960s. They include Bob Hamilton, Dick Raymond, R.J. Harris, Jim (J.J) Jefferson and Marissa Osborne, Ben Barber, Jack Wagner, Scott Donato, Kirk Wise (Wise Guy), Dave Eddy, Larry Flood, and currently on the air veteran broadcaster Michael Andrews who doubles as news director. Currently, afternoon drive is handled by air personality and program director Ray Thomas. Ray has been a major force in Carlisle radio for over a quarter of a century. Robin Quivers, now of The Howard Stern Show, received her first radio job on WIOO in late 1979. Quivers beat out a field of three applicants from the Broadcast Institute of Maryland (BIM) to get the news anchor position at WIOO.

WIOO was granted a construction permit by the FCC in 2015. The station's day power will increase to 15,000 watts, and it will gain critical hours power of 2,700 watts. The station's critical hour power is subject to local sunset of WMVP Chicago, Illinois, on the same frequency.
