The Faculty of Medicine of Damascus University () is the oldest university college in Syria, founded in 1903.  Under Faisal I it was called the Arab Medical School.

History
In 1901, the Ottoman authorities founded the Turkish Medical Institute in Damascus. An iradé of Sultan Abdülhamid II of 27 April 1903 transformed it into an imperial faculty of medicine. The language of instruction was Ottoman Turkish. The school moved to Beirut temporarily during World War I. With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire following that war, the school was brought back to Damascus and renamed the Arab Medical School, and the language of instruction was changed to Arabic.

For both the civilian and the military hospitals of the city of Damascus Medical Institute, Rida Said was elected chairman in 1920. In 1924 the publication of the Medical Journal of the Arab Institute began.

From its earliest days the Institute and Rida Said saw the need not just to train Syrians, but also many young men and women from across the Arab world. On average, half of the students were non-Syrian. In the 1950s over half the doctors in the Mashreq were graduates of the institute.

The university widened its remit after the evacuation of the French in 1946. The Institute began faculties of medicine. It had all the lecture halls and laboratories necessary for teaching. The college issued a doctor of medicine, bachelor of pharmacy, doctor of dental medicine and a certificate in nursing and midwifery in obstetrics. Successive reforms after 1946 have expanded the school and increased the number of students considerably. An act promulgated in 1958 during the unity of Egypt and Syria amended the Syrian name to the University of Damascus.
