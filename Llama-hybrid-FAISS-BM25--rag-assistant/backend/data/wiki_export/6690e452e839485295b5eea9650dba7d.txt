Singles championed by John Peel included "Jeremy Thorpe is Innocent" and "Martian Girlfriend".

She went on to appear in several of his television shows.

The BBC said: "Barbara is worried she and Ken (played by John Henshaw) are at risk of adding to the numbers of silver splitters - they have nothing in common; Ken's idea of retirement involves a marathon session of Pointless and that doesn't fit with Barbara's idea of a well-spent golden age."
The pilot was well received with 4 episodes commissioned and subsequently broadcast in March 2017.

In October 2015, Connolly appeared in the stage adaptation of Meera Syal's novel Anita and Me at the Birmingham Rep, for which she was acclaimed for her "comic talent".
