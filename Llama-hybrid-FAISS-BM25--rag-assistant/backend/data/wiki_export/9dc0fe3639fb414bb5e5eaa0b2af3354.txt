History 

Brooklyn College Academy, founded in 1986 in a partnership between the then-Board of Education and Brooklyn College, served as an alternative school—a program which was created to help older high school students that have not done well in other settings. The school no longer serves this purpose, and is a normal high school in the school system. Almost all of the school's graduates go on to attend college, two-year or four-year institutions.

The current principal is Shernell Thomas. Thomas was given the title of principal in 2019 following the retirement of previous principal, Nicholas Mazzarella, who began his career at Hostos-Lincoln High School in the Bronx and came to Brooklyn College Academy in 2005.
