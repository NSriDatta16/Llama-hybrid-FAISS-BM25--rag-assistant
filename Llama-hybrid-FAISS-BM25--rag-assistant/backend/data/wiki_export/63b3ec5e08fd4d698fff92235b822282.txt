Name
The village name comes from the local river, Lenaelva, which flows from Totenåsen (a hilly, forested area north of Hurdal and Hadeland). The river travels through the villages of Lena and Skreia to lake Mjøsa. In 1902, when the railway station was built, the station was named Lena (after the river), and since then the village area that grew up around the station became known as Lena. Lena Station was located along the Skreia Line from 1902 until its closure in 1987.
