Survivor

Marquesas

Ellis was a participant in the reality TV program Survivor: Marquesas, which was filmed in 2001 and aired in 2002.  

He was initially cast on the Maraamu tribe, alongside Gina Crews, Peter Harkey, Patricia Jackson, Sarah Jones, Rob Mariano, Sean Rector, and Vecepia Towery. Ellis was the "leader" of the tribe, and formed an alliance with Crews, which helped him survive the first two votes, but after Maraamu lost the third immunity challenge in a row, he was voted out on day 9 as he was seen as a controlling threat by Mariano.

Career
Subsequently, Ellis became the host of several nationally televised programs. The first of these was Tactical to Practical (also known as Tactical to Practical With Hunter Ellis), which aired on The History Channel as a program that took a historical look at the development of common consumer electronic products which originated as military research projects. It lasted for three seasons, with 38 episodes airing in 2003-04.

In 2004, he  began co-hosting 9 on the Town, a half-hour program airing five days a week on KCAL-TV (channel 9), an independent station in Los Angeles, California. In 2005, he began hosting another show on The History Channel, called Man, Moment, Machine. Episodes of this show focus on the historical consequences of the momentary interaction between a particular individual and a specific technology.

In 2007, Ellis became the host of Digging for the Truth, and in 2008 became host of In Harm's Way.

Ellis was a news anchor for KEYE-TV news in Austin, Texas from 2011 until he left in 2014 to focus full-time on documentaries.
