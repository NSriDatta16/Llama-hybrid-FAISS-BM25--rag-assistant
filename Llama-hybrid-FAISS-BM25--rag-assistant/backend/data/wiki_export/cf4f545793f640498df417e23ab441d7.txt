Musical career

Idlewild

Idlewild was formed in 1995 in Edinburgh by Woomble, Rod Jones, Colin Newton and Phil Scanlon. The band achieved critical and commercial success over nine albums and have toured worldwide. Their sound has moved from the punk rock of their earlier records, to the refined and thoughtful melodic rock of their latter albums. Their last album was 2019's 'Interview Music'. In 2020 they celebrated twenty five years as a band with a special UK tour and accompanying book titled 'In The Beginning There Were Answers; 25 years of Idlewild' which was written by Woomble.

Solo

In 2006, Woomble worked with several musicians including Kate Rusby, Idlewild guitarist Rod Jones and 
Dave Gow and Ailidh Lennon from Sons & Daughters on his debut solo album My Secret Is My Silence, produced by John McCusker. The album was released in July 2006, and Woomble toured the United Kingdom in support of the album's release. My Secret Is My Silence reached number one in the UK Folk Charts. A year later, on 10 July 2007, My Secret Is My Silence was released in the US on 7â€“10 Music.

Woomble's follow-up album, Before the Ruin, written and recorded with Kris Drever and John McCusker, was released on 15 September 2008 through Navigator Records.

In 2009 Woomble re-located to the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Hebrides and began work on a new album entitled 'The Impossible Song & other songs'. It was released in 2011 and was recorded entirely at the An Tobar arts centre in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull and features a cast of musicians from the Scottish folk scene. The album was accompanied by extensive touring around the U.K. 

The country influenced Listen to Keep followed in 2013, before Woomble concentrated again on Idlewild, returning attention back to his solo career with 2017's The Deluder, a darker and more introspective album. After the release of 2019's Interview Music album with Idlewild, Woomble changed direction again with the Everyday Sun EP (2020) and Lo! Soul (2021) which both share a minimal, electronic sound.

In 2023 Womble launched a new project called Almost Nothing.
