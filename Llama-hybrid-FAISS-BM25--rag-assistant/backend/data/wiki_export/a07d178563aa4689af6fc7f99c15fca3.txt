Ahluwalia is a surname native to the Punjab region of India. It is derived from the words "Ahlu" (a village in Lahore) and "walia" (a Punjabi-language adjectival suffix). It was first adopted by the Sikh Kalal chief Jassa Singh, the leader of the Ahluwalia misl. The surname was later adopted by many others, including the members of the Kalal caste who were not his descendants, leading to the formation of the Ahluwalia caste.
