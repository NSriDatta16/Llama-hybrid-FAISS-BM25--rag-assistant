Royal Hunt is a Danish progressive metal band. The band was founded in 1989 by keyboardist André Andersen in order to combine basic values of classic rock with progressive, current musical elements.   The name originated from a painting seen in a museum by the founding member/keyboardist André Andersen.

History 
Royal Hunt is known for creating melodic music with a progressive and symphonic flair. They experienced success during the mid-90s with American vocalist D.C. Cooper on their albums Moving Target and Paradox mainly in Japan and Europe.

Throughout their history the band has experienced several lineup changes. In 2007 they acquired singer Mark Boals, who replaced former vocalist John West. In 2011 after numerous requests from fans and promoters worldwide they decided to reunite with their former vocalist D. C. Cooper for a special tour, covering the first four albums of the band. They recorded a new album entitled Show Me How to Live featuring the returning D.C. Cooper as their permanent vocalist moving forward. Cooper also provided vocals for the 2013 album, A Life to Die For, and again provided vocals on "Devil's Dozen", "Cast In Stone" and "Dystopia – Part 1".

In October 2021, the group announced the completion of songwriting for the new album – "Dystopia – Part 2". The album will be released on 28 October 2022.

In Japan, the band is famous for the song Martial Arts, which was used as entrance music for professional wrestler Masahiro Chono.
