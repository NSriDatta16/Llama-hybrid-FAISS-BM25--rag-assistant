W. Connection Football Club is a professional football club from Trinidad and Tobago, which currently plays in the TT Pro League. The club plays its home games at the Manny Ramjohn Stadium in Marabella. The club's offices are based at the Point Lisas Industrial Estate.

History
The team was founded as W Connection Sports Club in 1986, as a "fete match" team, by brothers David John Williams and Patrick John Williams in San Fernando. Upon the creation of the TT Pro League, W Connection FC was officially founded in 1999, and promptly joined the nascent league. In 1999, their first season, the club finished third in the league, while winning the FA Trophy. Even though the club had a successful first season, the team would see even better times the next two campaigns, by winning the league in consecutive seasons.

The Savonetta Boys have also had success in domestic cups. W Connection have won the First Citizens Cup six years in the cup's nine-year existence. On September 26, 2008, in an exciting final of the cup, against Joe Public, W Connection used penalty kicks to claim the victory 6–5, after the match ended level 2–2, to claim their fifth consecutive title.
