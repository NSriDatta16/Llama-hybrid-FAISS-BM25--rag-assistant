George Fazio (November 12, 1912 – June 6, 1986) was an American professional golfer and a golf course architect.

Life and career
Fazio, born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was a respected player in the mid-twentieth century and competed in seven Masters Tournaments from 1947 to 1954. His best finish was 14th in 1952.

Fazio won two PGA Tour events: the 1946 Canadian Open and the 1947 Bing Crosby Pro-Am (in a tie with Ed Furgol). He had career earnings of more than $50,000. He nearly won the 1950 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club outside Philadelphia, finishing third to Ben Hogan and Lloyd Mangrum in an 18-hole playoff. This event was recently memorialized as one of the 15 most memorable Philadelphia sports moments. Like most golfers of his generation, Fazio earned his living primarily as a club pro during his regular career years. During the 1940s, he was head pro at Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles, where many of Hollywood's celebrities played.

After his playing days were over, Fazio went on to become a well-known golf course architect along with his nephews Tom Fazio, Jim Fazio, and course designer Lou Cappelli. The foursome built many notable courses, and they are particularly noted for the shapes built into their traps - such as clover-leaves and butterflies.

Fazio died in Jupiter, Florida at the age of 73.
