Wu Yinghua (1907–1996) was a famous Chinese teacher of Wu-style tai chi. She was born in Beijing and died in Shanghai. She was the eldest daughter of Wu Jianquan, the best known teacher of Wu-style tai chi. Her older brothers were Wu Gongyi and Wu Gongzao, also well-known tai chi practitioners.

Biography
Wu Yinghua began studying tai chi at age nine, and by age seventeen, she was a full-time teacher in her father's school. In 1921, she was invited to teach tai chi in Shanghai. In 1928, her father followed her to Shanghai and she became his teaching assistant. In 1930, she married Ma Yueliang who was Wu Jianquan's senior disciple. In 1935, Wu Jianquan founded the Jianquan Taijiquan Association (鑑泉太極拳社) in Shanghai. Wu Jianquan died in 1942.

After the Cultural Revolution, at about 1980, it became possible to teach tai chi publicly in China again. About this time her brother Wu Gongzao was released from prison and moved to Hong Kong. Wu Yinghua and Ma Yueliang, remaining in mainland China, created a simplified Wu tai chi form, and were again able to have public meetings of the Jianquan Taijiquan Association. They taught a large number of students in Shanghai and in their travels to New Zealand, Germany and elsewhere.  Together with Ma Yueliang, Wu Yinghua published several books on Wu-style tai chi.  The books "Wu style Taijiquan: Forms, Concepts and Applications of the Original Style" (commonly known as the "Orange Book"), "Wu Simplified Taijiquan", and "Wu style Taiji Kuaiquan" (Wu-style tai chi fast form) have been collected in a single volume in China. They also co-authored a Wu-style sword book. Wu Yinghua was the senior instructor of the Wu family from 1983 until she died in 1996.

Ma Yueliang and Wu Yinghua are survived by several children and grandchildren, including: Ma Jiangchun (b. 1931), Dr. Ma Hailong (b. 1935), Ma Jiangbao (b. 1941), and Ma Jiangling (b. 1947). Ma Jiangbao lived in the Netherlands and taught traditional tai chi in Europe. He died in 2016. Their adopted daughter Shi Meilin now lives and teaches in New Zealand. She also has students in France and in the United States (Tucson, Arizona).
