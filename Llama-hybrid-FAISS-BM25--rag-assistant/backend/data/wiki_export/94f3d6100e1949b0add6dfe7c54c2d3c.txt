Jean Glavany (born 14 May 1949 in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine) is a French politician of the Socialist Party (PS) and former Minister.

From 1981 to 1988, Glavany was head of cabinet of President François Mitterrand (PS). He was then Minister of Agriculture (1998–2002) in the Plural Left government of Lionel Jospin. Among other actions, he prohibited the Gaucho pesticide, alleged of being related to observations concerning the sudden decrease in bee population.

Glavany was elected deputy of Hautes-Pyrénées in 2002, and re-elected in 2007. He was part of the Socialiste, radical, citoyen et divers gauche parliamentary group in the National Assembly. Glavany is also president of the Community of Agglomeration of Tarbes.

Ahead of the Socialist Party's 2017 primaries, Glavany endorsed Manuel Valls as the party's candidate for the presidential election later that year.
