After the Truth () is a 1999 German film depicting the fictional trial of Dr. Josef Mengele, known as the "death angel of Auschwitz".
The film, starring Götz George as Mengele and Kai Wiesinger as his lawyer, is based on the original English-language screenplay by American writers Christopher and Kathleen Riley. The German title translates to "Nothing but the truth".

Synopsis
The infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele, who performed unethical medical experiments and is considered to be personally responsible for the selection of mass groups of detainees to be murdered in the gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp, comes back from his hideout in Argentina as an 87-year-old man who is in his last days. Back in Germany, he must face trial for his crimes. Peter Rohm, a young solicitor and expert on Mengele, has to defend him. But Rohm feels unable to do so; when he decides to take on the case he endangers not only the relationship to his wife but also their very lives.

While the entire world looks on the Mengele trial, Rohm learns that the history of his own family has a closer connection with the Nazis' genocide than he ever had suspected.

Production
Götz George was also a co-producer of the film, which had problems finding financial support. The actor invested heavily to see the film completed.
