Carntyne railway station serves the Carntyne area of Glasgow, Scotland. The station is 2¾ miles (4 km) east of Glasgow Queen Street railway station on the North Clyde Line. The station is managed by ScotRail.
The ticket office, constructed when the line was electrified by British Railways in 1960, was cleared away in the early 1990s leaving Carntyne station unstaffed and with only basic 'bus stop'-style shelters on the platforms for passengers to use.
