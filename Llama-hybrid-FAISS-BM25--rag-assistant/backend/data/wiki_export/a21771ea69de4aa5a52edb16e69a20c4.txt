Labyrinth

At the center of the school's courtyard is a spiraling brick walkway called the Roselle Catholic High School Labyrinth. The labyrinth is made of 8,000 bricks and was constructed in the summer of 2008 to commemorate Roselle Catholic's 50th anniversary as a school. A sign near the entrance to the courtyard explains its significance:
"Walking the ancient labyrinth is an ancient spiritual act that is being rediscovered in our time. Labyrinths are unicursal, offering one path. Unlike a maze, there are no dead ends. By combining a number of even older symbols, the labyrinth represents the journey inward to our own true selves and back out into the everyday world. Walking a labyrinth can be a metaphor for life – full of unexpected twists and sudden changes in direction. This can be a profoundly moving experience which offers opportunities for spiritual and personal growth."
