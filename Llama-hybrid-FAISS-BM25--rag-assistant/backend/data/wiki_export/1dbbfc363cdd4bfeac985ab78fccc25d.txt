Located on a zone of transition between the harsh and mountainous Trás-os-Montes and the verdant Minho, the municipality of Ribeira de Pena, crossed by the calm waters of the Tâmega River, displays unique characteristics and also offers visitors the unmistakable flavour of the region's "green wine." Equally rich is the heritage left by man since remote times, visible at abundant prehistoric remains such as the Stone Age engravings of Lamelas, several dolmens and archaeological monuments and fortified settlements such as the ruins found at Monte do Cabriz, near the village of Cerva.

The current mayor is João Noronha, elected in 2017 by PS. The municipal holiday is August 16.
