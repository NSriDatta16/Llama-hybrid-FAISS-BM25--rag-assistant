Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula is a 1990 novel by Barry Gifford.

Critical reception
Publishers Weekly wrote: "In the visual equivalent of sound bites, novelist and poet Gifford ... cuts to the heart with sharply focused shots of young lovers on the lam." Kirkus Reviews wrote that "Gifford's South is ersatz, tarred up with Forget-Me-Not Cafes and Dixie beer, his Romeo and Juliet more treacly than tragic."
