Katwoude is a village in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. It is a part of the municipality of Waterland, and lies on the coast of the IJsselmeer, about 2Â km north of Monnickendam.

The village was first mentioned in 1310 as "lant van Kattwoude". Even though there is a cat in the shield dating from 1566, it is not related to the animal. The name of the village refers to a swamp forest (-woude) that grew on kattige soil. This refers to the poor, lumpy peat soil around Katwoude.

Katwoude was home to 182 people in 1840. It used to be a separate municipality between 1817 and 1991, when it became part of Waterland. Katwoude used to share a mayor with Monnickendam.

The hamlet Zedde is part of Katwoude.
