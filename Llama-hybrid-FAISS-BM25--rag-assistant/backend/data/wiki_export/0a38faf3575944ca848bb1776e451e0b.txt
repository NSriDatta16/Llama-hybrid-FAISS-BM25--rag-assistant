Life
Benjamin Woodbridge Dwight was born April 5, 1816, in New Haven, Connecticut. His father was physician Benjamin Woolsey Dwight (1780–1850), and paternal grandfather was Yale University president Timothy Dwight. His mother was Sophia Woodbridge Strong (1793–1861).
In 1831 the family moved to Clinton, Oneida County, New York, where his father served as treasurer of Hamilton College after giving up his medical business. His uncle Sereno Edwards Dwight became Hamilton College's president in 1833.
He graduated from Hamilton College in 1835 and the Yale Theological Seminary in 1838.  He returned to Hamilton College to work as a tutor until 1842.
He founded the Congregational church at Joliet, Illinois, in 1844 and served as its pastor for two years.  
After moving to Brooklyn, New York, in 1846, he founded a private high school, which he operated for 12 years.  
In 1858 he moved back to Clinton and opened Dwight's Rural High School, with Reverend David A. Holbrook and Henry P. Bristol as associates. In 1863 Dwight opened another similar school in New York City on Broadway.

The Clinton school burned down in April 1865. In 1867 Dwight returned to Clinton and devoted his time to writing, including works on education, philology, a short biography of his father and a massive two-volume history of thousands of his cousins and ancestors.
