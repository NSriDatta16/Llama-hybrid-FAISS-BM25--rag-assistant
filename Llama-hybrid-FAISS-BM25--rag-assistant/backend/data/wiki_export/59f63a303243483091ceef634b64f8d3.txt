Troy Joseph Bergeron (born December 3, 1983) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys. He also was a member of the Georgia Force and Cleveland Gladiators in the Arena Football League. He never played college football.

Early years
Bergeron attended Shaw High School. He was a three-year starter at wide receiver in a Wing T offense, that focused on running the football. As a junior in 2000, he contributed to the team winning the state championship, while being named the 2000 Columbus Ledger-Enquirer's Offensive Player of the Year.

As a senior, he posted 25 receptions for 444 yards and 7 touchdowns. He had one interception in limited duty at cornerback. He missed three games during the season because of surgery to correct compartmental syndrome in his leg.

In track, he was part of the Georgia Class 4A state champion 4 × 400 metres relay team and placed second in the 400 metres as a senior.

College career
Bergeron initially accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University. Before he enrolled at the school, the coaches asked him to switch to defensive back because of a surplus at the wide receiver position, so he asked to be released from his scholarship.

He then transferred to Middle Tennessee State University, but while he was sitting out as a redshirt freshman, his fiancée gave birth to their son and Bergeron decided to move to Columbus to be with his family. He later requested to transfer to Troy University, which was closer to his home, but Middle Tennessee wouldn't release him from his commitment. He then opted to sign a professional football contract with the af2’s Columbus Wardogs and never played a down of college football.
