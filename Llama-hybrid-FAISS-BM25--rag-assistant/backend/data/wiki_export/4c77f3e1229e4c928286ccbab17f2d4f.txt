Lenape High School is a four-year comprehensive public high school located in Medford Township in Burlington County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is the oldest of the four high schools that comprise the Lenape Regional High School District, which serves students in ninth through twelfth grades from Evesham Township, Medford Lakes, Medford Township, Mount Laurel Township, Shamong Township, Southampton Township, Tabernacle Township and Woodland Township. Since opening in 1958, the school has served students from Mount Laurel Township. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1963.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,924 students and 162.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.8:1. There were 192 students (10.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 66 (3.4% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

History
After the regional district was formed in 1955, a plot covering  in Medford was selected in June 1956 as a site for the school, which was estimated to cost $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Lenape High School opened in September 1958, before which students from Medford, Medford Lakes and Tabernacle Township had attended Rancocas Valley Regional High School. Starting with 548 students in freshman and sophomore classes, the school grew quickly and now consists of two buildings, Lenape High School North and Lenape High School South. Lenape draws its student body from Mount Laurel. The school has two sides, North and South.

Students, starting in the fall 2008, attended classes based on the letter of the day.  Days could range from A-E, and each student's schedule may be different for each letter.  This allowed students never to miss too many classes.  For example, in past years, students with lab days on Fridays would have fewer lab days when it would be a three-day weekend because school was not in session on Friday.  With the letter days, students schedules rotate and eliminate this issue by having a student have lab on a specific letter day.

The current system that the high school employs is not much different from the letter schedule, but is significantly shortened. This is similar to the college system and helps prepare those for college. The school now relies upon a 4-day schedule with a total of eight periods, two of which are dropped every day. This way, a student's schedule rotates through four different options, having class periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the morning block, and having periods 5, 6, 7 and 8 in the afternoon, leaving out a morning and afternoon class each day. Every student, regardless of grade, also attends lunch at the same time, which is commonly known as Lunch and Learn. This time is not only utilized for lunch and social purposes, but for kids to receive extra help during their lunch from teachers who are available or meet with clubs and other activities. Each class is approximately one hour long.
