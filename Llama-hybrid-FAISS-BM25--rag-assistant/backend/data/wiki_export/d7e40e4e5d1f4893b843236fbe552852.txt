The Harushio class is a diesel-electric submarine class operated by the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). The design is an evolution from the  being slightly larger and with better noise reduction. Asashio, has been modified to test air-independent propulsion (AIP), and the remaining vessels were decommissioned and replaced by the Oyashio-class.

Natsushio, Hayashio, Arashio and Asashio are all named after World War II destroyers.
