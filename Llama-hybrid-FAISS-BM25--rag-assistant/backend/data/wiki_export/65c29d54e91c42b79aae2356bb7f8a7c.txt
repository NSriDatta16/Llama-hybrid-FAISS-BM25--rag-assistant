Chris made his first appearance of the season in the League Cup first round at Hillsborough versus League Two side Wrexham, the Owls lost 4–1. He was unlucky to concede a goal without even having a touch of the ball in the following match against Leeds United; he came on as a substitute when Jones was given a straight red card and immediately faced a penalty which was scored by David Healy.
