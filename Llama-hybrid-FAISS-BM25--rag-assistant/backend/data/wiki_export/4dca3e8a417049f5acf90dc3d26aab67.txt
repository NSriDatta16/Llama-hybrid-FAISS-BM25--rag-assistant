History

Founded in 1958, Prince George's Community College came into existence because there was perceived to be a need for educational opportunities for the residents of the county, particularly those who were still in the Kâ€“12 grades of the public schools in the late 1950s.

Classes commenced at Suitland High School, with a student body of 185; thus, the college celebrated 50 years of service in 2008. The college was the first educational institution to integrate in the county, and today serves more African-American students than any other post-secondary institution in the state of Maryland. In 1967, the college moved to its permanent location in Largo, Maryland, where it has grown to an enrollment of nearly 40,000 students. During the past decades, a handful of buildings on the campus has grown to 22 facilities.

In Spring 2007, the college selected its first female president, Charlene Dukes.
