Australian rock band AC/DC, , has released 18 studio albums (15 available worldwide and two released only in Australia), two soundtrack albums, three live albums, one extended play, 59 singles, 11 video albums, 58 music videos and two box sets. Although many AC/DC singles have been released, the band always refused to release any greatest hits-type packages; Who Made Who (which served as the soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive), Iron Man 2, and the band's various live recordings are as close as the group has come to such a compilation. Verizon makes AC/DC albums available to download, but for several years the band refused to release its albums on iTunes, as iTunes normally allows downloading of individual tracks; AC/DC publicly stated: "Our... reason is that we honestly believe the songs on any of our albums belong together. If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album â€“ and we don't think that represents us musically." However, the band finally released its entire discography to iTunes in November 2012. On 30 June 2015 their catalog appeared on Spotify for the first time.

Brothers, Angus and Malcolm Young formed AC/DC in 1973. The band released two albums in Australia before releasing its first international effort, High Voltage with vocalist Bon Scott, bassist Mark Evans and drummer Phil Rudd. In 1980, less than a year after the release of the successful Highway to Hell, Bon Scott died and was replaced by British singer Brian Johnson, with whom AC/DC released its best-selling album, Back in Black. The album Black Ice, released in 2008, reached number one in 29 countries. In 50 years of its career, AC/DC sold over 250 million albums worldwide, roughly 100 million in the US. Back in Black alone sold 25 million copies (50 million worldwide), and went on to become the second highest-selling album in history.

Notes
 A. The Official Charts Company views the move from WMG to Sony Music in the same way as records being re-issued, with "Highway to Hell" first charting on Columbia on 1 December 2012 and peaking at number 4 as part of a Christmas campaign a year later. 
 B. Promotional airplay single in Australia and the UK.
