Urea phosphate is a 1:1 combination of urea and phosphoric acid that is used as a fertilizer. It has an NPK formula 17-44-0, and is soluble in water, producing a strongly acidic solution.

Urea phosphate is available in fertilizer vendor bags that carry a UP signet on the packaging. It is sometimes added to blends which contain calcium nitrate, magnesium nitrate and potassium nitrate to produce water-soluble formulas such as 15-5-15 and 13-2-20. The acidity of urea phosphate allows Ca, Mg and P to co-exist in solution. Under less acidic conditions, there would be precipitation of Caâ€“Mg phosphates. Urea phosphate is often used in drip irrigation to clean pipe systems.

The phosphoric acid and urea molecules in the urea phosphate crystal structure form a complex hydrogen-bonding network. It freely dissociates when dissolved in water.
