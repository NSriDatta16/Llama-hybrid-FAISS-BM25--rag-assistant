The 1966–67 CMJHL season was the inaugural season of the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League.  It was formed by five members of the former Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League along with the Edmonton Oil Kings and the Calgary Buffaloes and was considered an "outlaw league" by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association.

The CMJHL was made up of seven teams based in Alberta and Saskatchewan that completed a 56-game schedule.  The Moose Jaw Canucks won the President's Cup.
