Cape of Good Hope (GB) (好望角, foaled 1998) is a British thoroughbred racehorse based in Hong Kong. Sired by Inchinor to dam Cape Merino, the chestnut gelding was trained by David Oughton. Despite being overshadowed by champion sprinter Silent Witness in Hong Kong, Cape of Good Hope had some success on international stages.

In 2005, he became the champion of the inaugural Global Sprint Challenge series by winning the Australia Stakes in Australia and Golden Jubilee Stakes in the United Kingdom respectively.
