The National Assembly (, Al-Maǧlis al-Waṭaniy) is the lower house of the National Legislature of Sudan. The Legislature was unicameral until 2005. The upper house is the Council of States (Majlis Welayat).

The National Assembly was dissolved on 11 April 2019 following a military coup which overthrew Sudan President Omar al-Bashir and Assembly's ruling National Congress Party.

As part of the 2019 Sudanese transition to democracy, a Transitional Legislative Council is to be formed which will function as the legislature of Sudan until elections scheduled for 2022.

Speakers
Hassan Abdallah al-Turabi was the speaker from 1996 until he stripped of the post in December 1999, and placed under arrest after a falling out with President Omar al-Bashir.

Sudan was previously in a transitional period following the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) on 9 January 2005 that officially ended the civil war between the Sudanese Government (based in Khartoum) and the southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) rebel group. The National Assembly consisted of 450 appointed members who represent the government, former rebels, and other opposition political parties.

Parliament building 
The seat of the National Assembly is Omdurman, immediately north-west of the country's capital Khartoum. The building was designed in the style of brutalist architecture by the Romanian architect Cezar Lăzărescu and completed in 1978. It is located on the banks of the White Nile at the confluence with the Blue Nile near the old Omdurman bridge.
