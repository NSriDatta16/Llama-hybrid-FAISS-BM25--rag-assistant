The Caucasian Common Market (founded in 1997) was a private holding company created to bring prosperity and well-being to the North Caucasus, and in addition, its recognition by the world community as an important subject of international commodity exchange and, consequently, international law.

Among the company's co-founders were former Chechen mafia boss and Chechen First Deputy Premier Khozh-Ahmed Noukhaev and Lord Alistair McAlpine, Baron McAlpine, of the Goldsmith family interests in London. The company's aim was to collect US$3 billion as the initial capital for investment projects in the region.
