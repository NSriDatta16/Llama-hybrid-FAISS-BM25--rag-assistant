History 

The original station was built in Leigh Old Town and opened in 1855, but a larger three-platform station some distance to the west was opened on 1 January 1934 to replace the first structure. The original building was then used by a local Sea Scout troop until the northern platform buildings were demolished to allow the widening of the adjacent road. The other platform and station building still exist and are currently used by Leigh Sailing Club.

There were formerly sidings on the 'up' London-bound side to the south-west of the station. There was a fatal accident at these sidings on 15 December 1935. The sidings had been partly decommissioned by 1969.
