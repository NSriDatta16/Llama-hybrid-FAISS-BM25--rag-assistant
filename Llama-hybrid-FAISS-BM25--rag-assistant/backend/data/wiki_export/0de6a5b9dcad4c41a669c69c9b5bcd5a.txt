Benedict L. Sliney (born 1945) is an American retired lawyer, air traffic controller, and former Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Manager. His first day in this position was on September 11, 2001, and he was responsible for ordering a National Ground Stop across United States airspace in response to the September 11 attacks.

Actions on September 11, 2001 
After American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and American Airlines into the Pentagon, Sliney gave the order to land every plane in the air over the US at the time (implementing the SCATANA plan), effectively shutting down US airspace. There were roughly 4,200 aircraft in flight. This was an unprecedented act, which the 9/11 Commission later denoted as an important and decisive moment in that morning's chaos. While Sliney made the decision on his own initiative, he had the advice of an experienced staff of air traffic controllers and traffic managers.

Although it was his first day in charge, Sliney had an over-25-year background in air traffic and management in the FAA. He had held various positions as an air traffic controller, first-line supervisor at several major facilities, and Operations Manager and Traffic Management Officer at New York TRACON. He also held positions as Traffic Management Specialist, National Operations Manager, and Tactical Operations Manager at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) and had regional office experience as Manager, Airspace and Procedures Branch, Eastern Region.

Sliney later left the FAA to practice law.

Personal life 
Sliney is married to Irene Lynch Ahern. , he is retired and lives in Sandwich, Massachusetts.
