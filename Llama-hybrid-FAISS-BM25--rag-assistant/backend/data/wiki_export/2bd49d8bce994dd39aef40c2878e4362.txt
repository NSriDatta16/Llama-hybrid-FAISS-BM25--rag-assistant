Daniel Boone Native Gardens, located in Boone, North Carolina, United States, has a collection of North Carolina native plants in an informal landscaped design. The gardens are open daily from May to October.

History
The gardens were planned as a laboratory so that clubs, schools and botanists could study plants within a small area. The Garden Club of North Carolina broke ground in May 1961 on land adjacent to the outdoor theater where Horn in the West is performed. The Asheville landscape architect Doan Ogden designed the layout of the gardens. The gardens officially opened to the public in 1966.

Features
The wrought iron gates at the entrance were given by Daniel Boone VI, a descendant of famed American frontiersman Daniel Boone. Its main features include a bog garden, stone gatehouse, rockery, grassed all√©e, wishing well, reflection pool, prayer shrine, rustic bridge and Squire Boone Cabin. Squire Boone Cabin is typical of the cabin in which Daniel Boone lived. The logs are from the cabin of Jesse Boone, Daniel's brother, where Daniel spent much time. The newest addition to the garden, the bog, was dedicated in June 1992.
