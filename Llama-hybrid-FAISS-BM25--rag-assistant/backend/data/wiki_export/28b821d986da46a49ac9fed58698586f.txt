Taft Avenue station is a Manila Metro Rail Transit (MRT) station situated on Line 3 and is the line's only station in Pasay. Located at the intersection of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), one of Metro Manila's major thoroughfares, and Taft Avenue usually referred to as Pasay Rotonda or EDSA-Taft, it is the southern terminus of the line. The station is named after Taft Avenue, which is in turn named after former U.S. President and U.S. Chief Justice William Howard Taft, who served as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1901 to 1903.

It is one of five stations on the line where passengers can catch a train going in the opposite direction without paying a new fare due to the station's layout. The other four stations are Araneta Center-Cubao, Shaw Boulevard, Boni, Buendia, and Ayala. Excluding Araneta Center-Cubao station, it is also one of four stations on the line with its concourse level located above the platform. However, crowd control measures at the station currently discourage passengers from switching trains at the platform level.

The station's location as a terminus has helped create many businesses in the area, from the number of hotels and motels to restaurants and shops, with a good majority of them being a short walk from the station.

Nearby landmarks
The station is connected to Metropoint Mall and Saver's Square, both of which are popular with commuters; as well as Winston Lodge and a branch of Hotel Sogo, two of the many motels found along EDSA near the station. It is also the ideal stop for those continuing to Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Bay City including SM Mall of Asia, Heritage Hotel, San Juan de Dios Hospital and College, and Manila Tytana College (formerly Manila Doctors College).
