"Out of Your Mind" is a song by UK garage duo True Steppers. It features Dane Bowers and Victoria Beckham, in her first appearance as a solo artist away from Spice Girls. The single was released on 14 August 2000 and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, beaten to the top by Spiller's "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" in a highly publicised chart battle.

Background and composition
Explaining her collaboration with Dane Bowers, Beckham said she loved dance music and was "flattered" to be asked to sing on the track.

Chart performance
In the United Kingdom, the single was released the same week as Spiller's "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)", which features Sophie Ellis-Bextor. Although "Out of Your Mind" was predicted to be number one until Saturday, "Groovejet" outsold it by 20,000 copies by Sunday, holding it back to the number-two position. "Out of Your Mind" sold 180,584 copies during its first week and has sold over 400,000 copies in the UK as of June 2017. It was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry and was the 21st-best-seller of 2000 in the UK.
