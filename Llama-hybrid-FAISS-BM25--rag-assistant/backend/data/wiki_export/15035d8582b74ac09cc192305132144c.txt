The 6L50 (and similar 6L45) is a 6-speed longitudinally-mounted automatic transmission produced by General Motors. It is very similar in design to the larger 6L80/6L90, and is produced at GM Powertrain plants in Toledo, Ohio; Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico; and by the independent Punch Powerglide company in Strasbourg, France. This transmission features clutch to clutch shifting, eliminating the bands used on older transmission designs. The 6L50 debuted for the 2007 model year on the V8-powered versions of the Cadillac STS sedan and Cadillac SRX crossover, and replaces the 5L40-E and 5L50 in GM's lineup.
