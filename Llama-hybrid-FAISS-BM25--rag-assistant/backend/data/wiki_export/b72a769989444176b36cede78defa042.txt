The ITF Year is the official yearbook of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). It replaced World of Tennis, edited by John Barrett as the ITF's official tennis annual. Its first edition, The ITF Year 2001, described the activities of the ITF in 2001 but was published in  January 2002. All subsequent editions have also  detailed events in the year following the date in the title, and have been published in the January of the following year, usually around the time of the Australian Open. The book was edited by Joanne Sirman in the 2001 and 2002 editions, Mitzi Ingram Evans from 2003 until 2012, and Jamie Renton from 2013 until 2016. The yearbook was discontinued in 2017.

The front covers of the books depict slightly blurred images of a tennis player or doubles team.
