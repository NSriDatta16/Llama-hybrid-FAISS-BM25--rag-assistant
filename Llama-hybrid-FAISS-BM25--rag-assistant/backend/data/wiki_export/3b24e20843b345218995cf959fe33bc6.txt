Geography

Point Lookout is Queensland's most easterly point.  To the north lies Cape Moreton and to the south the next major headland is Point Danger on the New South Wales/Queensland border. The other towns on the island are Dunwich and Amity Point.

In the west near the caravan park is Rocky Point and Adder Rock.  Cylinder Beach extends eastwards towards Cylinder Headland.  Frenchmans Beach fronts Frenchmans Bay.  At the eastern extremity is North Gorge and Whale Rock.  Offshore are several rocky outcrops above sea level.  The headland is an ideal location for land-based seawatching in Australia.  Humpback whales can also be seen from here as they migrate along the east coast of Australia. The area is mostly residential houses and tourist apartments built close to the beach and atop nearby ridges to take advantage of sweeping Pacific Ocean views. There are a few shops and a caravan park at Point Lookout.

There is no railway on the island, the nearest station being in Cleveland  to the west. Dunwich airport is  southwest.

History 
The point was sighted and named by James Cook on HMS Endeavour during his exploration of the east coast of Australia on 17 May 1770.

In 1803 Matthew Flinders in the cutter Hope came ashore at Cylinder Beach (Hopewell) to find water as he was returning to Port Jackson (Sydney) after he was wrecked in HMS Porpoise on the Wreck Reefs off Gladstone. It is first recorded contact between the British and the Noonuccal people in this area. The Aboriginal people assisted Flinders in finding fresh water to fill his barrels.

The Point Lookout Lighthouse was constructed in 1932, which is still in use today.

On 14 May 1943, the single greatest loss of life resulting from a submarine attack in Australian waters occurred  ENE off Point Lookout  when the hospital ship AHS Centaur was sunk by a Japanese submarine. On 15 May 1994 Minister for Veterans Affairs, Con Sciacca, officially unveiled a memorial to the sinking of the Centaur on Cylinder Beach Headland.

The Point Lookout Library opened in 2011.
