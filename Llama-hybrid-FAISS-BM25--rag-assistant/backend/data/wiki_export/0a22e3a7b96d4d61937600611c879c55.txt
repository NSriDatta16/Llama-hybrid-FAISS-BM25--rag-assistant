Thormodsgard Law Library

The three-story Thormodsgard Law Library adjacent to the School of Law building at UND is named in honor of Olaf H. Thormodsgard, who was Dean of the University of North Dakota School of Law from 1933 to 1962.

The library underwent a renovation in 2003 that added mobile compact shelving.  The upgrade increased the shelf-space for the library's growing collection of legal materials (which includes a core collection of 312,000 volumes).  Following a 15-month renovation a new wing opened.
