Music video
The music video was shot in New York, and officially premiered on 13 July 2006. In the beginning, Thalía and her boyfriend Anthony are shown happily bowling together. While the video goes on, the two are shown singing the song. When Thalía's part comes, she is seated. Next, they are playing billiards. When the bachata part (the actual chorus) breaks, Thalía and Anthony are dancing, in what seems to be a private room. After this, Thalía walks down to the bar and while asking for a drink, she sees Anthony with another woman. Thalía gets mad and walks away, whereafter Anthony calls her, apologizing for his actions and begging her to forgive him. Thalía does not let him finish talking, and hangs up on him.
