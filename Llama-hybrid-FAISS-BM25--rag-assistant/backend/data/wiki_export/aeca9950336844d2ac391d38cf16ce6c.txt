The House of Danneskiold-Samsøe is a Danish family of high nobility associated with the Danish Royal Family, and who formerly held the island of Samsø as a fief.

By royal statutory regulation, the Counts Danneskiold-Samsøe and their male-line descendants are ranked as the second-highest nobles in Denmark, second only to the Counts of Rosenborg, who also descend from the Danish Kings. With a place in the 1st Class No. 13, they are entitled to the style "His/Her Excellency".

The family uses a traditional spelling of the name; a modern spelling would be Danneskjold-Samsø.

History 
The name was created for several descendants of Danish monarchs of the House of Oldenburg, born of their liaisons with royal mistresses.  The first grantees were children from the 1677 marriage between Countess Antoinette von Aldenburg and Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve, Count of Laurvig, a celebrated (Norwegian) general and the son of Frederick III of Denmark by his mistress Margrethe Pape.  King Christian V, the count's half-brother, granted a comital title to all of his male-line descendants.

The next grantees were all the children of Christian Gyldenløve, Count of Samsø, the eldest son of Christian V by his mistress Sophie Amalie Moth in 1696. He married his cousin, Countess Antoinette Augusta von Aldenburg (1660-1701) (eldest daughter of Count Anton I von Aldenburg und Knyphausen and his first wife, Countess Auguste Johanna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein, himself a legitimated son of Anton Gunther, last independent Count of Oldenburg). The male Danneskiold-Laurvigen line was extinguished in 1783, and the Laurvig countship was inherited through an heiress by the noble Danish line of Ahlefeldt family.  In 1786, François Xavier Joseph Gyldenløve, second Count of Løvendal, great-grandson of Count Ulrik Frederik's first marriage, was granted the surname Danneskiold as well ; but this Danneskiold-Løvendal branch, too, was extinguished in its male line upon the death of his childless son in 1829. The first marriage of Count Christian produced only daughters, but the issue of his second marriage succeeded to the countship of Samsø and continues in male line, bearing the surname "Danneskiold-Samsøe".

All Danneskiolds since 1829 have been descendants of the eldest son of Christian V and his mistress Sofie Amalie Moth (1654-1719), whom the king elevated to be the first Lensgrevinde til Samsø ("Countess of Samsø"). A descendant, Countess Frederikke Louise Danneskiold-Samsøe (1699-1744,) married her kinsman Christian August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1696-1754), a partitioned-off duke, and from whose marriage all the future Augustenburgs descend.

The present comital family numbers the noble families Ahlefeldt, Frijs-Frijsenborg, Kaas, Trolle, Ulfeldt, Huitfeldt, Sehested, Gyldenstierne, Rosenkrantz, Rantzau, Reventlow, Brahe, Grubbe, Krag til Juellund, and Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs among their ancestress-linked relatives.

The present head of the family is Mikkel Archibald Valdemar Christian Count Danneskiold-Samsoe, with the style of Excellency.

Other Danneskiolds

Danneskiold-Løvendal 
Frederik III's son with Margrethe Pape, Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve's sons from his first marriage to Sophie Urne, Carl and Woldemar (1660-1740) became barons of Løvendal in 1662, the latter's son Ulrik Frederik Woldemar was elevated in 1741 by the king of Poland to regent, and his son, Major General and french Marshal François Xavier Joseph Danneskiold-Løvendal (1742-1808), was admitted in 1778 to the Danish court with the name Danneskiold-Løvendal. This line became extinct in 1829 with his son Carl Valdemar Count Danneskiold-Løvendal (1773-1829).

Danneskiold-Laurvig 
Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve's children from his third marriage to Countess Antoinette Augusta von Aldenburg were named Danneskiold in 1693. The son, Ferdinand Anton, founded the count's line Danneskiold-Laurvig. He owned the County of Laurvig in Norway , was director of the West Indies-Guinea Company and built it since the Counts Moltke belonging to the Palace in Bredgade in Copenhagen. With his son Christian Conrad, Count Danneskiold-Laurwigen, the line also died out in 1783.
