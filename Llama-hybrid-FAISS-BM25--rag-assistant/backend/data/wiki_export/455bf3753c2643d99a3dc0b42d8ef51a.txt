Csaba Fehér (born 2 September 1975 in Szekszárd) is a former professional Hungarian footballer. He was a defender who could also operate in midfield.

Football career
Fehér started playing professionally with Hungarian sides Pécsi MFC, Újpesti TE and MTK Hungária FC. In January 2000, he moved to Belgium, representing lowly Verbroedering Geel.

From 2000 to 2004, Fehér played with NAC Breda in the Netherlands, eventually catching the eye of Eredivisie giants PSV Eindhoven. However, his time there would not be a successful one, as he was consecutively loaned, to old team Újpest and Willem II.

After spending 2007–08 again on loan, this time to NAC Breda, Fehér made the move permanent for the following season.

In June 2011, he returned to his Újpest FC.
