Brief history
The business unit has been in existence for more than thirty years.

It began as Silicon Systems of Tustin, in Tustin, CA. An unusual vision of the original business was to provide complete solutions, including analog, digital, firmware and any large-systems software and drivers. It was reorganized and sold to Texas Instruments, reorganized, then parts of the business were sold to TDK Corporation, which moved it to nearby Irvine, CA. Teridian Semiconductor was formed on April 8, 2005, in a leveraged buyout arranged by Golden Gate Capital, a venture capital firm. Maxim Integrated Products acquired Teridian Semiconductor in 2010. The Teridian energy measurement products group was sold to Silergy Corporation on March 18, 2016, with some personnel remaining with Maxim to support other products.
