Newpark Comprehensive School () is a mixed, Church of Ireland, state comprehensive secondary school in Blackrock, County Dublin, Ireland. It was established in 1972.

History 

Newpark has a Christian tradition, reflecting its origins within the Protestant tradition, and is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin. The school was established in 1972, when the Department of Education purchased Avoca & Kingstown School, an amalgamation of two small private schools. Avoca School in Blackrock was founded in 1892 by A.A.[Albert Augustus] MacDonagh M.A. (1869-1934) who served for a long time as its headmaster, and Kingstown Grammar School in 1894 by Matthew Edward Devlin (whose son Rev. John Edward Devlin took over as Kingstown's headmaster in 1932).

The two founding schools catered primarily for Protestant children in the Blackrock/Dún Laoghaire area, but the schools also welcomed pupils from other religious faiths, and from none. In 1968 the original schools amalgamated as Avoca & Kingstown School at Newtownpark Avenue. Four years later it became Newpark, one of the four Comprehensive Schools established by the Government to:
make free second-level education accessible to the Protestant community within an appropriate ethos.
provide educational and recreational facilities for the local community.
act as centres for educational innovation.

Newpark has a specific obligation to the Protestant community of south Dublin/north Wicklow, and this is reflected in its special recognition of the National Schools under Protestant management in the catchment area and by the priority given to those enrolling from the Protestant community. Newpark also considers itself a pluralist community; it embraces inclusion in terms of social, cultural, religious and ethnic diversity.

Sports 
The school offers a range of sports including field hockey, rugby and basketball. Its rugby senior team has held the McMullen Cup since 2007. Avoca Hockey Club is based on the campus.The students also have access to Newpark Sports Centre which has a sports hall and a swimming pool.

Campus 
The Newpark campus covers 100,543m² (25 acres). The school was centred on a purpose-built prefab-style block, opened in 1974, but also used two large houses, "Melfield" and "Belfort" (Referred to as the Red-Brick by students), a purpose-built extension to Belfort (The D/F Building), a gate lodge and other ancillary rooms. .  In 2015 a new school building was opened to students and many of the ancillary rooms were demolished leaving only Belfort and Melfield standing from the original plan.
