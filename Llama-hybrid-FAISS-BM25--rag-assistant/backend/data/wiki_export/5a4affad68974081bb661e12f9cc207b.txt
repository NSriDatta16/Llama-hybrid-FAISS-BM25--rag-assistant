Gawamaa or Gaw√°m'a is a Sudanese ethnic group. They are a large sedentary tribe in North Kordofan, and sections of them also helped form the Halafa sub-group of the Hawazma tribe, itself a sub-group of the larger Baggara group. According to British colonial administrator Harold MacMichael, the Gawamaa were one of six non-Hawazma tribes integrated into the Hawazma tribe in the mid-eighteenth century by way of an oath.

The number of its members is about 750,000. The members of this group speak Sudanese Arabic. All members of this group are Muslims.
