The varadamudra () is a mudra, a symbolic gesture featured in the iconography of Indian religions. It indicates a gesture by the hand and symbolises dispensing of boons. It is represented by the palm held outward, with the fingers outstretched and pointing downwards. Sometimes, the thumb and the index finger meet, forming a circle. 

The varadamudra and the abhayamudra are the most common of several other mudras seen on divine figures in the art of Indian religions.
