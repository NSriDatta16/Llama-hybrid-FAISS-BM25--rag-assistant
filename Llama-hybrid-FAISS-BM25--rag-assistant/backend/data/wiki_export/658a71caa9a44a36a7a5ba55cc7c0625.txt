"Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)" is a song by English synth-pop duo Erasure. It originally appeared on the soundtrack to the documentary film Wigstock: the Movie, as "Cold Summer's Day". The duo re-recorded it for their seventh studio album, Erasure (1995), with new lyrics. Composed by Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, it is an uptempo dance track. The album version is over six minutes long; the single edit removes an extended instrumental section between the second and third choruses.

The song was released as the second single from the album by Mute Records in the UK and Elektra Records in the United States. The track subsequently became Erasure's 22nd consecutive top-20 hit on the UK Singles Chart. In Germany, it stalled at number 69, while in the United States, it was a hit on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, peaking at number 10. The single's B-side is a cover version of "High Energy" (retitled "Hi NRG") by American singer Evelyn Thomas.

Critical reception
British magazine Music Week wrote, "Initially harking back to a more familiar ground, Clarke and Bell deliver a  hummable four-on-the-floor putdown which transmutes into an epic of scorn."

Music video
A music video was made to accompany the song. It features Bell singing the song as he walks through an amusement park. The actual filming was done in the London Docklands.
