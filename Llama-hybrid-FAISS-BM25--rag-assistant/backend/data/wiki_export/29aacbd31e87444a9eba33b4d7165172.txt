Chodov () is a Prague Metro station on the second section of Line C. It was opened on 7 November 1980 as part of the extension from Kačerov to Kosmonautů (currently Háje).

The station is located under Roztylská Street in the southwestern part of the Chodov district. It is a shallow sub-surface station with a straight ceiling and an island platform 10 m below ground level. Centrum Chodov, the largest shopping centre in the Czech Republic, was built next to the station in 2005.

The station was named Budovatelů until 1990.
