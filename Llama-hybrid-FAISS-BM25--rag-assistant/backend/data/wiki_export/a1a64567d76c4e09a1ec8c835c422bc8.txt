History
The first station in Ballymena opened on 11 April 1848 by the Belfast and Ballymena Railway. This initial station was rebuilt and relocated on 4 December 1855 when the Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway extended the line northwards.

At one time, there were several other stations in the Ballymena area, however the only other one which survives to this day is Cullybackey.

In addition to mainline services between  and , the station provided a terminus for two narrow gauge railways:
 Ballymena, Cushendall and Red Bay Railway - which opened in 1875 and closed in 1940
 Ballymena and Larne Railway - which opened in 1877 and closed in 1933

The station buildings were rebuilt in 1903-1904 to designs by Berkeley Deane Wise. The rebuilding cost in excess of £15,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The clock was provided by Sharman D.

The original station buildings were removed in 1981-1982 during a modernisation programme by Northern Ireland Railways.
