Sights

Harz charcoal burning museum 

Along the road leading to Blankenburg is the Harzköhlerei Stemberghaus. This is an open-air museum that produces charcoal in the traditional way. The site includes a restaurant, the Köhlerhütte, built in 2012, and a souvenir shop. The museum is checkpoint 60 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

Memorial Stone on the Town Square 
A memorial stone dedicated "to those who suffered and lost their lives in wars and under terror and violence" is located in the northwest corner of the central town square. During socialist rule in East Germany this stone had a much larger plaque stating "We Want Peace", which in 1993 was replaced by the present one. Judging by the number of holes drilled in the stone and by their location it is apparent that this stone had more uses in the past.

Personalities
