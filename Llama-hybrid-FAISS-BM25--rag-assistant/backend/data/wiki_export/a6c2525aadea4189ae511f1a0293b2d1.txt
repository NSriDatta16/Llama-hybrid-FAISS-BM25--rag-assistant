Bonjour la Classe is a British television comedy series which was broadcast on BBC1 in the beginning of 1993. Created and written by Paul Smith and Terry Kyan, the series centred on Laurence Didcott, a new teacher of French at the fictional prestigious Mansion School.

Didcott discovers a prevailing attitude at Mansion, among staff, benefactors and even students and parents that places what is best for the school (e.g. fundraising, school image) ahead of the education of the pupils and their wellbeing. The scenes at the school were shot in the winter of 1992.
