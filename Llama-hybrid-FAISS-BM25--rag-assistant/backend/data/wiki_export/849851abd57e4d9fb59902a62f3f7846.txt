The Dahlia Handicap was a race for thoroughbred horses run annually at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California. The Dahlia is open to fillies and mares, age three and up, willing to race one and one-sixteenth miles on the turf.  A Grade II was last run 2008.

The race was run in two divisions in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1989, and 1990. It is named in honor of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame inductee, the great racing mare Dahlia.  Born in 1970, died in 2001 at age of 31, Dahlia won the big races in France, in England, in the United States, and in Canada.

Due to problems with the turf course, in 2004 the race was run on dirt and as such for that event was downgraded to a G-III event.
