Taras () is a male Ukrainian given name especially popular in Ukraine.  In Greek mythology, Taras (Ancient Greek: Τάρας) was the eponymous founder of the Greek colony of Taras (Tarentum, modern Taranto), in Magna Graecia (today South Italy).  The name was later modified in Byzantium after Saint Tarasios (also Saint Tarasius; ).  Saint Tarasios's feast day is on the Calendar of Saints, celebrated on February 25 by the Eastern Orthodox and Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church churches, and on February 18 by the Roman Catholic Church. (This date on the Julian Calendar at present corresponds to March 10 on the Gregorian calendar).

A common version is that the name Taras means "rebellious" from Greek word "rebellion" - ταραχή (tarahi), but this version is not confirmed. In Greece name Taras is practically unknown.

The spread of the name in Ukraine is explained by its association with Taras Shevchenko, a national poet and unifying figure for the Ukrainian nation who was likely named after Saint Tarasios as he was born on March 9, 1814. 

After Taras Shevchenko, naming your child Taras came to signify the allegiance to the national cause in a Ukrainian family.
