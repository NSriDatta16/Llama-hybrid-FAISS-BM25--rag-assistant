Deputy assistant secretary for health (1999–2001)
From 2000 she was appointed by Bill Clinton to the post of deputy assistant secretary for health within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the highest position that a nurse had ever held in the US government.

General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (2001–2006)

In 2001 Malone moved to the United Kingdom when she was appointed to the post of General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), the largest professional union of nursing staff in the world, succeeding Christine Hancock. This was somewhat surprising; as she later wrote "How could the RCN want an American, an African American to run the most prestigious professional nursing trade union in the world? [Malone, 2007] Clinton is said to have smoothed the way politically by "having a word" with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown She was to remain in this post until January 2007.

She was also a member of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and represented the RCN at the European Federation of Nurses Associations (EFN), the Commonwealth Nurses Federation, and the International Council of Nurses (together with the RCN president).

She was at first the subject of considerable media attention and some controversy, partly because of the novelty of an American holding such a political post in Britain, but also because of her generous remuneration package. There was also criticism of her mother, Dorothy Black, receiving free eye surgery under the National Health Service soon after her arrival in spite of having paid no British taxes or insurance contributions. Officials stated that her mother not been given preferential treatment and, as a resident or dependent relative of a resident, was entitled to the same free healthcare as anyone else. She was also criticized for attending a Labour Party event as a guest, because of the traditional party-political neutrality of her employer.

In 2003 she became a member of the steering committee of the NHS Modernisation Agency.
In 2006, Tony Blair appointed her as a member of the UK delegation to the World Health Assembly. She had previously represented the United States in a similar role in 1998 and 1999.

In an interview with the Guardian newspaper before returning to the United States, while criticizing job cuts and cost cutting in the British National Health Service, she spoke favorably of the system, calling it "a treasure" and praising a system where healthcare is a right rather than a privilege. Though treated somewhat roughly by the British media, she welcomed the greater "visibility" of the nursing profession in Britain, compared with the United States.
