The "Troutman St. Ambush" of Bill Bonanno by DiGregorio Faction shooters has brought Joe Bonanno back to N.Y. to rally his troops and supporters against DiGregorio and his Commission supporters. With the sudden return of Bonanno, DiGregorio loses both the support of his remaining gunmen and The Commission withdraws its support due to his inability to lead the Family.

May 17 – Joseph Bonanno, after being in hiding for 19 months, officially surrenders to federal authorities at the Foley Square Courthouse. Later that day after appearing before a judge and receiving bail, Joe Bonanno along with his son Salvatore "Bill" Bonanno and several close associates such as his brother-in-law Frank LaBruzzo and Bonanno crime family caporegime, Joseph "Little Joe" Notaro decide to dine at La Scala restaurant in Manhattan.

September 22 – A police raid by the NYPD at the LaStella Restaurant in Queens, New York reveals a meeting between New York, Florida and New Orleans mafia members including Carlo Gambino, Tommy Eboli, Joe Colombo, Joey N. Gallo, Mike Miranda, Aniello Dellacroce, Dominic Alongi and  Anthony Cirillo from N.Y., Carlos Marcello, Joe Marcello, Anthony Carolla  and Frank Gagliano from New Orleans, along with  Santo Trafficante Jr. from Tampa. The meeting, later known as "Little Apalachin Meeting", appeared to be concerning the leadership succession within the Lucchese crime family as longtime boss Thomas Lucchese who had been hospitalized for over a year was terminally ill and basically in retirement. Also on the meeting agenda was allegedly the division of underworld territory and operations in New Orleans.  Anthony Carolla, the son of former boss Sylvestro "Silver Dollar Sam" Carolla and a high level member of the New Orleans crime family felt entitled to more of the crime family spoils and a guarantee of ascension to the position of crime family boss once recently named boss, Carlos Marcello eventually retires. Carolla felt that he had been disrespected and ignored by the Marcello regime in New Orleans and deserved to be recognized as a top crime family member being the son of former New Orleans mafia power Sam Carolla. The Commission members present voted in favor of Marcello and decided Carolla should be given control over additional crime family interests, but nothing of importance that would diminish the influence and profits of Marcello. Carolla was not guaranteed the succession, but almost 30 years later became boss in New Orleans.
