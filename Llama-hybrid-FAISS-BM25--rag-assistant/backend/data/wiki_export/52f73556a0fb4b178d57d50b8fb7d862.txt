Aleister Crowley (12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947) was a highly prolific writer, not only on the topic of Thelema and magick, but on philosophy, politics, and culture. He was also a published poet and playwright and left behind many personal letters and daily journal entries. The following list contains works published and edited by other hands after Crowley's death.

Libri

Many of the important works of Aleister Crowley are in the form of Libri (lit. "books"), which are usually short documents consisting of core teachings, methodologies, practices, or Thelemic scripture. All the libri are given a number in the Roman numeral system, and those that are part of the A∴A∴ curriculum are assigned a "class" as follows:

 Class [A] consists of books of which may be changed not so much as the style of a letter:  that is, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization.
 Class [B] consists of books or essays which are the result of ordinary scholarship, enlightened and earnest.
 Class [C] consists of matter which is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anything else.
 Class [D] consists of the Official Rituals and Instructions.
 Class [E] consists of manifestos, broadsides, epistles and other public statements. Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class.
