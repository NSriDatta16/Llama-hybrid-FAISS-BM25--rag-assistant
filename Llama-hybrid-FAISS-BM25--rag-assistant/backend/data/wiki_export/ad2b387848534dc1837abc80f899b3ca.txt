Cherokee Bryan Parks (born October 11, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player. He played nine seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

A 6 ft 11 in (211 cm), 240 lb (109 kg) center, Parks played college basketball at Duke University under coach Mike Krzyzewski and won the 1992 national title during his freshman year. After college, he was selected by the Dallas Mavericks in the 1st round (12th overall pick) of the 1995 NBA draft. In his nine-season NBA career (1995–2004), he played for the Mavericks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Vancouver Grizzlies, Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio Spurs, Washington Wizards, and Golden State Warriors. He averaged career-highs of 7.1 points and 5.5 rebounds per game during the 1997–98 season with Minnesota. Parks came out of retirement in 2011 to play in France.

Parks had a stint as a team liaison for the New Orleans Pelicans, and is now in charge of Player Development in the NBA

In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Parks said that his mother named him "Cherokee" because in 1972, when she was pregnant, "she learned that her husband's great-grandmother had been a full-blooded Cherokee." Parks stated, "It was serious stuff...I was politically active then, and the name was a tribute."  His sister was the original bass player for the band Nashville Pussy.
