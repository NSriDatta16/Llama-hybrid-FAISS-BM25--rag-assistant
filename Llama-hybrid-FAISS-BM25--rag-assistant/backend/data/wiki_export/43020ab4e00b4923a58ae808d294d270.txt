Flat Earth controversy
In April 2017, it was revealed that an anonymous PhD student at the university had submitted a thesis defending a flat Earth, and that it had passed the initial review stage, although its thesis defense was unsuccessful. It also defended geocentrism and young-Earth creationism, and denied Newtonian mechanics and the Big Bang, largely based upon a literal interpretation of the Quran. The incident sparked discussion of the academic standards in Tunisia and the Arab World. Faouzia Charfi, a professor at the nearby University of Tunis, asked, "How can we accept that the University is not the space of knowledge, of scientific rigor, but that of the negation of science? That where science is refused because it is not in conformity with Islam?"

Belgian astronomer Yaël Nazé also wrote an article on the subject. She commented that even though the thesis was first publicly announced on April 1, "it was not an April Fool’s joke."
