History
It is unclear exactly when the club was formed – the club itself notes that the present name was adopted in 2002 but does not state when the earlier incarnation had actually been formed.  It is known that the club, under its previous name of Burman Hi-Ton F.C., won the Birmingham Works League Division One in the 1996–97 season and joined the Midland Combination in 1998, where the team won the Division Three championship at the first attempt.

In 2001–02 the team won the Division Two title to gain promotion to Division One, whereupon the club adopted its present name. Success again came quickly in Division One, with a runners-up spot in 2003–04 gaining the team promotion to the Premier Division.
