Here Come the Mummies (HCTM) is an American funk rock band best known for its live performances and anonymous band members.

The band consists of various professional musicians based in Nashville, Tennessee. There are rumored to be several Grammy awards among the members, though this is difficult to verify, as the identities of band members are kept "under wraps."  Members are believed to be under contract to various record labels, hiding their identities so as to prevent contract disputes while performing.

According to the band's humorous promotional material: "Some say [the band was] cursed after deflowering a great Pharaoh's daughter. Others claim they are reincarnated Grammy-Winning studio musicians. Regardless, HCTM's mysterious personas, cunning song-craft, and unrelenting live show will bend your brain, and melt your face."

Style and influences 

Here Come the Mummies' music is funk rock that incorporates elements of jazz, soul, ska and reggae. The band's influences include Otis Redding, Sly and the Family Stone, Stevie Wonder, Commodores and Kool & the Gang. The band's appearance may have been inspired by the garage rock band The Mummies, who also performed in bandages and anonymously.
