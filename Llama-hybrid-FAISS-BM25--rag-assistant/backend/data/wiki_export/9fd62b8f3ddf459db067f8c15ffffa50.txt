Soward capped off a brilliant season in his first year with Panthers with him playing in 25 matches, scoring 7 tries, kicking 63 goals and a field goal.

Off the field in 2014, Soward began a feud with former NRL player Beau Ryan after Ryan mocked Soward on The Footy Show.  Soward was reportedly angry that Ryan had made fun of his voice and the way that he talked as the player has a lisp.  Ryan came out to the media and said “It's all light-hearted stuff and I didn’t mean to hurt anyone, and if I have hurt anyone I'll stop it".

2015
Following round 2 against the Gold Coast Titans in the Panthers 40-0 win at Bathurst, Soward had back surgery and missed a month and a half. When Soward returned in round 9, against the Brisbane Broncos in the Panthers 8-5 loss at Penrith Stadium, he was inconsistent at best and, coupled with a spate of injuries, he and the Panthers struggled throughout the season. The Penrith Panthers finished off a brutal 2015 NRL season just two points shy of a wooden spoon. Soward finished the season playing in 16 matches and kicking 22 goals. On 10 October 2015, rumours were floating around about Soward was set be released from the Panthers but these were dismissed by Soward. In early December, Soward gave himself a 12-month ultimatum: vowing to walk away from the game if he didn't return to his best in the 2016 season.

2016
On 13 February 2016, Soward played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars, playing off the interchange bench in the 8-12 loss at Suncorp Stadium. In Round 10 of the 2016 NRL season, Soward scored a try and kicked 5 goals against the New Zealand Warriors in the Panthers 30-18 win, breaking his 2 year try-scoring drought in what was one of his best solo performances in over a year. However, Soward's form later slumped and he was dropped to the NSW Cup. On 30 June 2016, Soward was released from his Panthers contract mid-way through the season and he re-joined the London Broncos. Soward was sent off for punching during London's 34-30 defeat by Leigh Centurions.

On 15 July 2016, Soward taunted former NRL player Beau Ryan on social media after Ryan had done another skit on The Footy Show making fun of Soward.  In the sketch presented by Ryan on the show, Soward's face was superimposed on the black cat that ran onto Pepper Stadium.  Ryan commented "Over the weekend we saw a strange new trend of coaches and ex-players trying to sneak into the grounds and not be noticed.  This little scaredy cat (vision of Soward's face on cat) who tried to run away had no-one fooled…".  Ryan then added in a whiny voice: "It's too cold…meow".

Soward then took to social media platform Twitter and displayed a picture of himself holding the NRL premiership trophy which he won as a player in 2010 with St George and the caption of "Show me yours and I'll show you mine, oh wait shit sorry you don't have one#".

Soward then typed a message at Ryan saying "He must miss me I'm not even in the country and still doing shit jokes. Oh well guess that's why I work with the gang @FOXSportsAUS all class".
 
On 7 November 2016, Soward announced his retirement ending a 14 year professional career. Soward played in 12 matches, scored 1 try and kicked 32 goals for the Penrith Panthers in the 2016 NRL season.
