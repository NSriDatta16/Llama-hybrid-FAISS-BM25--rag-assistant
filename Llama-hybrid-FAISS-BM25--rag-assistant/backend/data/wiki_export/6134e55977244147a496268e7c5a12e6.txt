Tamarillo was an Anglo-Arab gelding that excelled in the sport of eventing under rider William Fox-Pitt.

Foaled in 1992 at Biddesden Stud Tamarillo was shown successfully as a young horse becoming Part Bred Champion at the annual National Arabian Horse Show in Malvern in 1995.  He was first ridden by Diana Burgess through novice and intermediate levels. In 1999 the ride was taken over by William Fox-Pitt. Together they represented Britain in international competitions from 2002.  Tamarillo was withdrawn after the cross country phase of the Athens Olympics after chipping his stifle.

In September 2013 it was announced that a clone of Tamarillo, named Tomatillo, had been born.
