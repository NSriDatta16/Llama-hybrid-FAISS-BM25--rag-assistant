"Black Cherry" is a song by British electronic music duo Goldfrapp. The song was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and Will Gregory for their second studio album, Black Cherry (2003). The song was released as the album's fourth single in March 2004 to positive reviews from music critics. It was a modest commercial success, reaching the top thirty in the United Kingdom and on the United States Hot Dance Singles Sales chart.

Background and reception
Goldfrapp began work on "Black Cherry" in 2002 in a darkened studio in the countryside of Bath, England. Alison Goldfrapp contributed the song's lyrics, which she described as "personal stuff"; in subsequent interviews, she would not elaborate on the song's meaning.

"Black Cherry" received positive reviews from music critics. In a review for About.com, Wes May described the song as "lush" due to Goldfrapp's "endearingly chirpy vocals". MusicOMH.com reviewer Helen Wright called the track "blissful" because of its "plaintive strings, spaced-out melodies and soaring over everything, the unmistakable voice of Alison Goldfrapp". The CD single featured the B-side "Gone to Earth". The song was described by MusicOMH.com as a "treat" because of its "slightly oriental..off-key piano intro" that "turns into the most ethereal chill out music imaginable".
