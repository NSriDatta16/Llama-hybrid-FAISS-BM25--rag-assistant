Bob Lape (born Robert Cable Lape; 1933 in Akron, Ohio) is an American broadcast journalist, writer, restaurant reviewer, and food critic.

Career 

Lape worked as a reporter and news director at WCUE in Akron, Ohio, WICE in Providence, Rhode Island and WBZ in Boston, Massachusetts, before joining WABC-TV in New York City as a charter member of the Eyewitness News team in 1968.  Originally hired as a political and crime reporter (beats he would continue throughout his run with the station), as well as being an occasional anchor, Lape started a segment called "The Eyewitness Gourmet" in 1970. It became a highly popular feature on the program, running 1,200 times in 12 years and was called "the harbinger of the Television Food Network" by restaurateur Drew Nieporent. Lape also reviewed film and theater for WBZ-TV and WKBG-TV in Boston and for WABC-TV.  After leaving Eyewitness News, he hosted a phone in talk show, Bob Lape's Food Show, on WABC (AM) and wrote a restaurant column in the New York Law Journal. He also served as a network radio news correspondent for the ABC Information Network. His restaurant review column in Crain's New York Business was its most popular feature for 24 years, and "Bob Lape's Dining Diary," broadcast on WCBS since 1986, focuses on eating and drinking reviews, trends and events. Lape is the author of the journals Epicurean Rendezvous, 1990â€“1996, and Bob Lape's Restaurant Index, 1987-1991 (along with art by Milton Glaser). Lape is co-author with Joanna Pruess of the book Seduced by Bacon : Recipes & Lore About America's Favorite Indulgence
