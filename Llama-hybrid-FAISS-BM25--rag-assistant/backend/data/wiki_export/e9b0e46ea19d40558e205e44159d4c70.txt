History 
The name Hendra is derived from the railway station name which was assigned 1882 probably given by Queensland Railway Commissioner Francis Curnow. Hendra is a traditional Cornish place name meaning an ancient or old hamlet or town.

Hendra was originally a farming district, an expansion of the Nundah settlement. The crops were citrus fruits, grapes and pineapples. There were also dairy herds.

Eagle Farm State School opened on 1 August 1864. In 1908 the school was renamed Hendra State School.

The Brisbane Courier advertised the "Grand drawing and distribution of land prizes"  in January 1870. This portion of land had been part of land allocated to the Queensland Turf Club, tickets were advertised at £1 each.  A plan for the subdivision notes its location within the Parish of Toombul and Eagle Farm Racecourse reserve.

In 1874, a Baptist Church opened in Hendra, having been relocated from Nundah where it had been used as a Baptist church since 1859.  A new Baptist Church was opened in Hendra on Sunday 12 April 1891, with the former church to be used as a Sunday school.

Hendra Day School was a small private school operated from circa 1886 by Dora Franz in a building behind her father's home at 6 Best Street. The school closed on 1928 and the school building was bought by the Toombul Croquet Club and relocated to be their clubhouse in York Street, Nundah (where it still remains).

In October 1887, "Hendra Railway Station Estate" was advertised to be auctioned by James R. Dickson & Company Auctioneers. The estate was made up of 83 allotments and was advertised as being close to both Hendra and Clayfield stations. The area was then part of the Shire of Toombul.

In  March 1889, "Raceview Estate" comprised 34 allotments, was advertised to be auctioned by John MacNamarra & Co Real Property Salesmen. The estate was part of the Eagle Farm Racecourse Reserve, close to Hendra Railway Station and overlooking the Racecourse itself.

In September 1926, "Petersen Estate" was advertised to be auctioned by A.S.Phillips & Sons, Auctioneers. The estate comprised 25 allotments  with some fronting Newmarket and Gerler roads. The remaining streets that formed the estate are now known as Rita St, Dorames St and Olive St. The map advertising the sale also notes its proximity to Hendra State School, Nudgee Road and its convenience to Hendra Railway station.

Hendra State High School opened on 29 January 1963. On 1 January 1994 it was renamed Hendra Secondary College. On 1 January 2007 it was renamed Aviation High, as the school is physically close to Brisbane Airport and the associated aviation and aerospace industries.
