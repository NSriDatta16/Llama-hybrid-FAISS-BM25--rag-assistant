History
Construction of the $27 million,  school was plagued by construction delays. It opened two months before construction was complete, with students initially limited to partial days of classes. The name was selected in 2003 by school board trustees. When they asked for suggestions, the most frequently submitted name was Oscar Peterson, but because he was still alive, Peterson wasn't eligible to have a school named after him.

The school name garnered attention in 2018 because of civic awareness regarding the historical treatment of Indigenous peoples in the Canadian residential school system. In 2021, the school board determined that the name must be changed; in March 2022, the new name of Laurel Heights Secondary School was confirmed.

Programs
The drama department participates in the annual SEARS festivals. In the 2012–13 school year, they advanced to regionals. In 2014, they hosted the festival for Waterloo schools, and in 2018 they hosted NTSDF.

LHSS offers numerous clubs, teams, and activities with over 10 choices per season. As of 2019, the Fraser Institute ranked LHSS as one of the best schools in Ontario with an average performance score of 8.1 out of 10. LHSS ranks better than 90 per cent of schools in the Waterloo Region and 85 per cent of schools in all of Ontario.
