Energy supply is the delivery of fuels or transformed fuels to point of consumption. It potentially encompasses the extraction, transmission, generation, distribution and storage of fuels.  It is also sometimes called energy flow.

This supply of energy can be disrupted by several factors, including imposition of higher energy prices due to action by OPEC or other cartel, cum, political disputes, economic disputes, or physical damage to the energy infrastructure due to terrorism.  The security of the energy supply is a major concern of national security and energy law.

Other uses 
Some sources refer to "energy supply" when actually referring to the oil reserves or other potential sources of energy.

New York Consolidated Laws includes a statutory code called "Energy Law".  Article 21 of this code is called "Energy Supply and Production", but rather than a comprehensive code, only consists of one section dealing with renewable energy.
