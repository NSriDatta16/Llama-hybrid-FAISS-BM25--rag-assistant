The stadium usually hosted two tournaments each season: a "Champions Trophy" in October/November, and a "Cup" in March/April.  Typically three teams would participate in the tournament, but the format would vary, with as few as two and as many as six teams appearing.  The team which competed most often in the Sharjah Cup was Pakistan, who appeared in 28 of the 32 tournaments; Pakistan are also its most successful team, with a total of 14 titles.
