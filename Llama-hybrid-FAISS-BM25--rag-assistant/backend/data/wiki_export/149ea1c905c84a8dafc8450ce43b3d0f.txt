Lynx Lake, Arizona, is a  reservoir located within Prescott National Forest, approximately  east of Prescott, Arizona, in the Bradshaw Mountains. The lake is located at  elevation and is stocked for fishing. It is one of the most popular recreation areas in central Arizona. Mild weather, the cool ponderosa pine forest, trout fishing, boating, mountain hiking, horseback riding, archaeological sites, and bird watching attract visitors from throughout Arizona. The lake was formed in 1952, when a dam was put in Lynx Creek,  below Walker, Arizona.

Ecology
Animals native to the area include mule deer, bald eagles, osprey, and javelinas. Several species have been introduced, including rainbow trout, bull frogs, and domestic ducks and geese. Arizona State Game and Fish Department periodically stocks the lake with rainbow trout. Largemouth bass and crappie are also present in the lake. The lake is open all year.

Plant life in the area consists of ponderosa pine, beargrass, cliff-rose, and alligator juniper.
