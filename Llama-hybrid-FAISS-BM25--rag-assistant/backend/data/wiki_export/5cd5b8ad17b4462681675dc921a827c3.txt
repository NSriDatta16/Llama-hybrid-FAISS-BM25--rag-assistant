Rollin', released in 1974, was the first full-length album by Scotland's Bay City Rollers.  The album included three British chart hits ("Remember", "Shang-a-Lang", "Summerlove Sensation") and the debut of "Saturday Night", never a British hit yet a No. 1 smash in America, later.

While the album itself was not released in America, several of the songs would later appear on the band's self-titled U.S. debut.
