Kathleen Margaret "Kit" Pearson  (born April 30, 1947) is a Canadian writer and winner of numerous literature awards. Pearson is perhaps best known for her linked novels The Sky Is Falling (1989), Looking at the Moon (1991), and The Lights Go on Again (1993), published in 1999 as The Guests of War Trilogy, and Awake and Dreaming (1996), which won the 1997 Governor General's Award for English-language children's literature. She was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2019.

Pearson was born in Edmonton, Alberta and spent her childhood between that city and Vancouver, British Columbia.  As a high-school student, she returned to Vancouver to be educated at Crofton House School. She obtained a degree in English Literature at the University of Alberta. In 1975, she began her Library degree at the University of British Columbia and took her first jobs in that field in Ontario. She later obtained an M.A. at the Simmons College Center for the Study of Children's Literature in Boston. Returning to Vancouver, she completed her first novel The Daring Game which was published by Penguin Books.

Pearson moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in 2005, where she lives with her partner Katherine Farris.
