was a Japanese video game developer and publisher founded in 1983. The company produced games for a number of platforms, including home consoles, portable consoles, and personal computers. Human declared bankruptcy in 2000 and disbanded. Its former members went on to form new companies including Nude Maker, Sandlot, Spike, and Grasshopper Manufacture.

The company is known for originating the popular Fire Pro Wrestling series, as well as other sports games such as Formation Soccer and Final Match Tennis, and racing video games such as Human Grand Prix and Fastest 1. They are also known for developing the first music rhythm video game, Dance Aerobics (1987), the 3D open world game Mizzurna Falls (1998), and some early horror games including the Twilight Syndrome and Clock Tower series.

History
On November 1, 1999, Human Corporation began to negotiate restructure with Tokyo Hachiōji district court over the approximately 4 billion yen outstanding debt. As part of the deal, the game creator school subsidiary was to be transferred. At the same time, the rights of Fire Pro Wrestling series, Twilight Syndrome series, Bakusou Dekotora series went to Spike Co., Ltd.

In January 2000, Human Corporation declared bankruptcy for failing to negotiate for a restructuring deal over the 3.79 billion yen (as of November 1999) outstanding debt.

Former Human members went on to form different development teams including Nude Maker, Sandlot, and Spike, and notable member Goichi Suda formed his own company, Grasshopper Manufacture, with former members.
