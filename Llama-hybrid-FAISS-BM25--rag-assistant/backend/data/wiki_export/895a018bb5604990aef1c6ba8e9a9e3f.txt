Molson Indy Montreal winners (1984–1986)

During practice for the 1984 race, Rick Mears suffered serious foot and leg injuries after a crash on the mainstretch.
The 1985 race is known for a highly controversial finish involving Johnny Rutherford and Pancho Carter. Under safety car situation on the final lap, Rutherford led second place Carter, and appeared on his way to victory. As the field came out of the final corner, the safety car suddenly exited to pit lane, and the field unexpectedly started racing the final straightaway to the finish line. Carter got the jump on Rutherford, and edged his nose just ahead at the stripe, appearing to steal the victory. Officials deemed Carter the winner, and Carter celebrated in victory lane. Rutherford's team protested the finish because no green flag waved, and CART later restored the win to Rutherford. In most motorsport codes, when a race ends under the safety car, it exits to pit lane on the final lap and the leader crosses the line. In most North American codes, the safety car leads the field to the finish line.
