Red Bank Regional High School (often abbreviated RBR) is a comprehensive regional four-year public high school and school district that serves students in ninth through twelfth grades from the boroughs of Little Silver, Red Bank and Shrewsbury, three municipalities in Monmouth County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.

The school includes a vocational program, which students from anywhere in Monmouth County (who pay tuition, with the exception of in-district students, and students coming from districts where their respective district pays) can attend as a major in one of the many programs, including the Academy of Visual and Performing Arts, the Academy of Information Technology, Academy of Finance, Engineering, and Graphic Communications. The school also offers a freshman academy which reduces the size of the school for incoming freshmen by dividing them among three houses. In the spring of 2009, RBR was approved by the International Baccalaureate (IB) North American Division as an IB school and began offering the IB program to juniors and seniors in the fall of 2009. In the fall of 2009, RBR also launched its three-year academies for sophomores, juniors and seniors in the areas of Math & Science, Humanities & Social Studies, International & Cultural Studies, and Sports Medicine & Management.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,247 students and 117.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.6:1. There were 189 students (15.2% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 14 (1.1% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

The district is classified by the New Jersey Department of Education as being in District Factor Group "FG", the fourth-highest of eight groupings. District Factor Groups organize districts statewide to allow comparison by common socioeconomic characteristics of the local districts. From lowest socioeconomic status to highest, the categories are A, B, CD, DE, FG, GH, I and J.
 
Red Bank Regional High School is overseen by the New Jersey Department of Education and is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology and the National Academy Foundation.

History
The original Red Bank High School was opened in 1901.

Prior to the establishment of the regional district, students from Holmdel Township, Little Silver and Shrewsbury had attended Red Bank High School as part of a sending/receiving relationship. The Holmdel Township Public Schools switched from Keyport High School and started sending students to Red Bank in 1962, which ended when the district opened Holmdel High School in September 1973.

The school district was established in 1969 and used space rented from the Red Bank Borough Public Schools until construction of the new high school building was completed in 1975. This building, at 101 Ridge Road in Little Silver, was constructed on the site of the former Lovett Nursery. The new school replaced one that had opened in 1917, at 101 Harding Road in Red Bank, one mile away on the same road, that now serves as Red Bank Middle School.

Awards, recognition and rankings
In the 2011 "Ranking America's High Schools" issue by The Washington Post, the school was ranked 45th in New Jersey and 1,394th nationwide. RBR was named to Newsweeks list of top high schools in the country in its June 2010 article "America's Best High Schools 2010", ranked number 1,557 in the country.

The school was ranked 84th in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which included 316 schools across the state. Schooldigger.com ranked the school 135th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (an increase of 33 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the mathematics (84.9%) and language arts literacy (94.1%) components of the High School Proficiency Assessment.

In the spring of 2010, Red Bank Regional received the designation of model program resource center for its English Language Learning Program. The designation was determined by the New Jersey Language Model Program Committee, and extends from 2010 to 2012. Additionally, the RBR Visual and Performing Arts Academy was recently honored by the New Jersey Art Education Partnership  as a Model School in the Arts.

These majors typically include multiple classes per day and participation in certain extracurricular events and activities as part of the requirements.
