History

The first written mention of this cheese is from 1452. In 1583, the name tvarůžky appeared for the first time.

Until the 19th century, Olomoucké tvarůžky was produced in the villages surrounding Olomouc, and was generally regarded as a peasant food. It was at this time that the cheese began to be referred to as Olomouc curd cheese. The A. W. Company has been making this cheese since 1876.

In the first decades of the 20th century there were still several dairies in Loštice that produced the cheese. Until the Holocaust some were belong to Jewish families: Langer, Eckstein, Klein and Wischnitzer.
