Lovere (Bergamasque: ) is a town and comune in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, northern Italy, at the northwest end of Lake Iseo.

The houses in the city have overhanging wooden roofs, typical of Switzerland, combined with the heavy stone arcades of Italy. It lies on a lake and is flanked by a semicircle of mountains. It is a member of the I Borghi più belli d'Italia ("The most beautiful villages of Italy") association. In 2018, Lovere was the only Lombardy town to finish in the top 20 of Italy's most beautiful towns.

History
The first known settlement in the Lovere area dates to the 5th and 4th century BC, being of Celtic origin. Later it was conquered by the Romans, attracted by its strategic position location between the Val Camonica and the Val Cavallina, as well as for its transport potential on the Lake Iseo.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire it was ruled by the Lombards and the Franks. Given to the monks of the Marmoutier Abbey, it was sold to the Bishops of Bergamo, who, at the time of the Guelphs and Ghibellines struggle, were in turn replaced by the Celeri family. The fights lasted until the mid-15th century, when the territory was conquered by the Republic of Venice, whose rule lasted until the French invasion in 1797.

The English aristocrat and writer Lady Mary Wortley Montagu  spent ten years of her life on the shores of Lake Iseo.
