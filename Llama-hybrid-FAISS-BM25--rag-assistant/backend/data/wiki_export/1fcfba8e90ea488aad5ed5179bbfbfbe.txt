Fisherman's Island State Park is a public recreation area of  sitting on  of Lake Michigan shoreline southwest of Charlevoix, Michigan. It is named for a small piece of land, Fisherman Island, located some  from the mainland. For most of the period from 1998 to 2016, historically low lake levels resulted in the island becoming attached to the mainland via a tombolo. The park's interior terrain consists largely of rolling dunes covered with maple, birch and aspen broken up by bogs of cedar and black spruce. The park is operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

Activities and amenities
The park features rustic campgrounds with some sites nestled in the dunes along the lake shore. The park offers picnicking, swimming beaches, over three miles of hiking trails, hunting, and snowmobiling.
