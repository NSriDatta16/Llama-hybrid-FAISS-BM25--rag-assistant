Writing career

Ebershoff published his first novel, The Danish Girl, in 2000. It is inspired by the life of Lili Elbe, one of the first people to have gender reassignment surgery. The novel won the Rosenthal Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Lambda Literary Award for Transgender Fiction, and was a finalist for the New York Public Library's Young Lions Award and an American Library Association Award, and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. An international bestseller, it has been translated into more than twenty-five languages.

In 2015, producer Gail Mutrux adapted the novel into an Oscar-winning film also called The Danish Girl, directed by Tom Hooper and starring Eddie Redmayne and Alicia Vikander. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, two Screen Actors Guild Award, five Critics' Choice Awards, and five BAFTAs. Vikander won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, a SAG, and a Critics Choice Award for her role in the film. It won the Queer Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival.

In 2017 The New York Times named The Danish Girl as one of the "25 books that have shaped LGBTQ literature over the past 20 years." In 2017 Ebershoff established the Lili Elbe scholarships for emerging transgender writers in conjunction with the Lambda Literary Foundation.

Ebershoff's book of short stories, The Rose City, is a collection of stories about queer life at the end of the 20th century. It won the Ferro-Grumley Award for excellence in LGBT fiction, was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award, and was named one of the best books of the year by the Los Angeles Times.

Publishers Weekly called it "an exquisite tour-de-force" and named it one of the best books of the year. Kirkus Reviews said that it was "reminiscent of Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose in scope and ambition", while the Los Angeles Times praised it by saying that "it does that thing all good novels do: it entertains us." In 2009, British television talk show hosts Richard and Judy chose The 19th Wife for their on-air book club, making the book a #1 bestseller in the UK. In 2010, the book was made into a television movie of the same name starring Matt Czuchry, Patricia Wettig, and Chyler Leigh.
