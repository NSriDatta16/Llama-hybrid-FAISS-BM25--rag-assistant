Adam Dariusz Seroczyński (; born 13 March 1974) is a Polish sprint canoeist who competed from 1997 to 2008. Competing in three Summer Olympics, he won a bronze medal in the K-4 1000 m event at Sydney in 2000. For his sport achievements, he received the Golden Cross of Merit in 2000.

Seroczyński also won three medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships with a silver (K-2 1000 m: 2007) and two bronzes (K-1 1000 m: 2002, K-2 1000 m: 2006).

He is now a member of the Posnania Poznań club. In September 2008, following the Beijing Olympics, Seroczyński tested positive for clenbuterol in a doping test. He was officially suspended for two years by the International Canoe Federation for his actions during the 2008 Summer Olympics and became the first canoeist to fail a doping test during the Summer Olympics.
