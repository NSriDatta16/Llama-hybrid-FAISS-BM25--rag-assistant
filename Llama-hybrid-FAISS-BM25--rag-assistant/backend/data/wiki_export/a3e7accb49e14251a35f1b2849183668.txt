Democratic Confederation of Nepalese Trade Unions  (DECONT) was a central trade union organization in Nepal. DECONT is politically tied to the Nepali Congress (Democratic). The president of DECONT was Rajendra Bahadur Raut.

DECONT was formed after a split from the Nepal Trade Union Congress, the trade union wing of the Nepali Congress. DECONT was constituted on May 1, 1997. The DECONT-NTUC split predated the NC(D)-NC split. Thus the Sher Bahadur Deuba fraction inside NC had a separate trade union wing, before they had actually constituted a separate party.

In May 2005, DECONT joined the World Confederation of Labour (now the International Trade Union Confederation).

During the spring of 2006 DECONT took part in the protests against the regime of King Gyanendra.

On March 2, 2008, it merged with Nepal Trade Union Congress, forming the Nepal Trade Union Congress-Independent.
