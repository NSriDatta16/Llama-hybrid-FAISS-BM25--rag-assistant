The Derryfield School is an independent college preparatory, coeducational high school and middle school located in Manchester, New Hampshire, United States. It is a day school serving grades 6–12.

History

In the early 1960s, a group of 39 Manchester families came together to establish a new school, focused on educating the "whole child" like a boarding school; however, it would be a day school, allowing for family involvement in students' daily lives. The school was incorporated in July 1964, and in the fall of 1965, The Derryfield School opened its doors, with 108 students in grades 7–10, and 11 faculty members. The first headmaster was one of the founders, R. Phillip Hugny. Grades 11 and 12 were added in the two successive years as the original tenth grade students advanced; the first commencement was held in 1968. Grade 6 was added in 1999.

While naturally focusing on academics, the founders also wanted students to be well-rounded, civic-minded individuals, able to make a positive difference in their community. So, from the school's beginnings, additional emphasis was placed on the arts, athletics, and community service.

The school spent its first year and a half in the Boys Club in downtown Manchester. In February 1967, the first buildings of its new campus were completed on River Road, north of downtown, and the school relocated there.

Since then, the school has grown to almost 400 students in seven grades and a faculty and staff of more than 80. The campus has continued to expand to meet the requirements of the growing student body and education in the 21st century. The focus on educating the whole child has not changed, however. Alongside the academic program, athletics, the arts, and community service continue to be the foundation of a Derryfield education.

Campus

The original  parcel of land on which the school buildings sit was bought from the Morrison family in 1965. Construction of the first campus buildings began immediately, and the school moved into its new facilities in February 1967.

As the student body grew, numerous campaigns were launched to expand the school's facilities. The first, in 1973, financed the construction of the Center for Student Activities – becoming the gymnasium which, at the time, also served as an auditorium. In 1981, a connector from the academic building to the gym was built, to house the school's library, administrative offices, and a student forum. A performing arts theater was completed in 1988, and a new middle school building was added in 1999. The Gateway Building, completed in 2010, contains the admission, development, alumni, and business offices, as well as the offices of Breakthrough Manchester. A new Science and Innovation Center was completed in 2019 in the space of the old gymnasium and its locker rooms. It contains wet and dry labs, a makerspace, robotics lab, inspiration lounge, and an audio/video production studio.

The grounds were expanded in 1996, when the school acquired  of land, adjacent to its original parcel, from New Hampshire College (now Southern New Hampshire University). The school used this additional acreage to build six new athletic fields and a cross-country running course, allowing for the continued expansion of its athletic offerings.

The Turf Field, Derryfield's premier artificial surface athletic field, was built in 2008, with floodlights added in 2009. Drainage and special snow blowing equipment make it ready to use in or after almost any weather situation. Derryfield's soccer, field hockey and lacrosse teams use it regularly, and the baseball and softball teams use it for practice when their grass fields are unplayable. The field is also used by outside clubs and teams, either for regular rental, or in the early spring, when their own grass fields may be still frozen or under water.

The construction of a new Athletic and Wellness Center was completed in November 2019. The new building is located on top of the land where the tennis courts used to be, across from the building with the old gym.

Beginning in fall 2022, construction of a new dining hall has begun. The dining hall will be built into the Athletic & Wellness Center, and fill the space between the center and the main school building. It is set to be completed in fall 2023.

Athletics

Derryfield offers a comprehensive interscholastic athletic and physical activity program on several levels, competing in numerous sports in both the Middle and Upper Schools during all three seasons. The Middle School teams compete in the Tri-County League, with teams from New Hampshire's Merrimack, Hillsborough and Rockingham counties. The Upper School is a New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association Division IV member school, although some sports such as lacrosse and field hockey compete in higher divisions, due to the team's record of success. There are also opportunities to participate in non-team and independent sports in both the Middle and Upper Schools.

Every student in grades 7–12 is required to participate in two seasons of physical activity each year. Missing a practice or a game is considered as serious as missing a class. Failure to complete the physical activity requirement will jeopardize graduation.

In both middle and high school, students have the option to participate in what is called an Independent Sport. This means that to fulfill one of two yearly sports requirements, students may count a sport or activity they participate in outside of school. They must log the same amount of hours per week as a Derryfield sport, and it must be signed off by a supervisor. Only one independent sport is allowed per academic year.
