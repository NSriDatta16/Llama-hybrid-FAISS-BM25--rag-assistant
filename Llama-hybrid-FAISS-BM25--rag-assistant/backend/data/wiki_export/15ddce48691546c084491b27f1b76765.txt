Abersychan School is a state-funded and non-selective comprehensive school in the Pontypool suburb of Abersychan, Wales.

Admissions
Abersychan School has 920 pupils on roll. It serves the north of Torfaen including the communities of Blaenavon, Garndiffaith, Talywain, Abersychan, Pontnewynedd, Cwmffrwdoer, Trevethin, Penygarn and St Cadocs. The local diversity is exemplified by the fact that some areas qualify for Communities First status, while the northern half of the Afon Llwyd encompasses a World Heritage Site.

The school supports a Special Needs Resources Base for pupils in Torfaen with MLD.

History

Comprehensive
The closure of Trevethin Community School in September 2007 has resulted in large numbers of pupils from its former catchment choosing Abersychan as their preferred school.

The re-organisation of education in the north of the borough was supported by a capital investment in Abersychan School which has improved the teaching and learning facilities, most notably in the form of several classrooms, a sports laboratory, an ICT suite with a 60 PC capacity, an Art and Technology design area, a floodlit astro-turf and a sports field. In 2009 a multi-media learning plaza was opened.  In January 2008, the school received a Welsh Secondary Schools Association award for its outstanding contribution to the transition of pupils from the Trevethin Community School to Abersychan School during the period 2006â€“2007.
