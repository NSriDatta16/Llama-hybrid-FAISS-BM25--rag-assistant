Cavegirl is a 2002-03 British TV series created and written by Daniel Peacock. It starred Stacey Cadman, Stephen Marcus and Lucinda Rhodes-Flaherty. It followed the adventures of a teenage cavegirl. Although based in a Stone Age world, there are many references to modern pop culture and in a similar vein to The Flintstones there are many ancient versions of modern inventions featured. Its theme tune is a cover version of “Go Wild in the Country”, sung by Stacey Cadman. It was developed by Dan and Producer Georgia Dussaud. Daniel Peacock's production company Two Hats Film and TV eventually produced.  It featured many of the same actors that also appeared in Peacock's other productions, such as Harry and Cosh and Billie: Girl from the Future.

Plot 
The main characters are Cavegirl herself and her family Dad, Mum, Big Sis, Gran and Little Bro. Other tribe members feature prominently. Cavegirl is a pretty, feisty individual and a bit of a tomboy although during the series she begins to become interested in boys and many of the storylines involve her becoming more mature. Big Sis is very interested in her appearance and how boys see her. She is also rather shallow. Dad is the stereotypical rugged caveman, although he is protective of his children, and is the chief of the tribe. Mum is a little dozy and Gran is very young at heart and more than a little crazy. Little Brother is curious about the world and often annoys Cavegirl immensely.

In season 2, Dad has left to look for new hunting grounds, and a new character, "Chief", has replaced him. In a flashback episode near the end of the season it was shown that Dad left Mum in charge, but she lost a bet with "The Chief of the Tribe to the North" and the tribes merged to form a larger one.
