Career Overview

In 2003, Boswell had been ranked in the world's top-10 for two years and had reached a career-high ranking of World No. 4, when a mystery back ailment forced him to stop playing. He returned to the professional tour in 2005. On his return, he won six of the tour's lower-ranking tournaments in a row, and two further lower-ranking tournaments later in the year. He broke back into the world's top-20 in 2006 and the top-10 in 2007.

At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Boswell won a bronze medal in the men's singles, and silver medal in the men's doubles partnering Anthony Ricketts. Boswell and Ricketts again won a men's doubles silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The pair won the men's doubles title at the 2006 World Doubles Squash Championships.

After losing out to Gr√©gory Gaultier during the 2011 Kuwait PSA Cup, Boswell announced he would retire from professional play.
