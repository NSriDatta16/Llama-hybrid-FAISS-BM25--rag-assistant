Pádraig or Pádraic ( , ), also Pádhraig or Pádhraic ( , ), are Irish male given names deriving from the Latin Patricius, meaning "of the patrician class", introduced via the name of Saint Patrick. The name is often anglicised as its English language equivalent Patrick or phonetically, e.g. Pauric.

Diminutives include Páidín, Páidí (both anglicised as 'Paudeen' and 'Paddy', respectively), and the feminine equivalent Pádraigín (little Patrick), which was originally an exclusively masculine name before later being viewed as the Irish equivalent of the feminine name Patricia. Pádraig is also sometimes anglicised as Paddy or Podge; the former anglicisation is often used, sometimes pejoratively, as a term for Irish people as a whole.
