Robert Edwin Wadkins (born July 26, 1951) is an American professional golfer. His older brother, Lanny, won 21 times on the PGA Tour, including the 1977 PGA Championship, and is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame.

Wadkins was born in Richmond, Virginia. Between Bobby and Lanny, they held the Richmond, Virginia city junior title for six consecutive years – two by Bobby and four by Lanny. After attending the University of Houston for one year, Wadkins earned All-American honors in 1972–73 at East Tennessee State University.

Wadkins turned pro in 1973. He never won on the PGA Tour despite six runner-up finishes in 715 events, but he did win on the European Tour and the Japan Golf Tour. Since turning 50, he has played on the Champions Tour and won four times, including one senior major, the 2006 Senior Players Championship. Wadkins is tied with Mark Wiebe as the Champions Tour's youngest winner at the age of 50 years and 10 days when he captured the Lightpath Long Island Classic.
