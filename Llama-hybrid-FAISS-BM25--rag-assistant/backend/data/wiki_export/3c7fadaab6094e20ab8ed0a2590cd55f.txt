Barry is the seventh studio album released by American singer and songwriter Barry Manilow in 1980 on Arista Records. The album was certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA.

Synopsis
The tracks were recorded at Evergreen Recording Studios in Burbank, California. Manilow co-wrote with Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire the album track "Only in Chicago". "We Still Have Time" was taken from the film Tribute.

The album scored one top ten pop hit, "I Made It Through the Rain", which reached number ten, in early 1981. Although "I Made It Through the Rain" was his only Top-10 on the Hot 100 from this album, he managed to reach the Top-10 on the Adult-Contemporary lists with "Lonely Together" and the bouncy up-tempo "Bermuda Triangle" was a Top-20 hit in the UK in mid-1981.
The album has yet to be released on CD in the US, but has had a CD release in Japan. It is however available as a digital download.

Critical reception

Joe Viglione of AllMusic, in a 3 out of 5 star review, called the album "an interesting piece of the Manilow collection, the singer covering Kenny Nolan, co-writing with Maurice White, penning a song for another film -- "We Still Have Time" from the motion picture Tribute -- and including a campy duet with Lily Tomlin." Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that "Barry, Mr. Manilow's newest album, isn't as lively as some of his earlier work, but it's pleasant enough. Mr. Manilow's forte remains the mini-aria arranged like an elaborate jingle."
