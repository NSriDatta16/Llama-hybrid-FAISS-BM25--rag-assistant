The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) is an interdisciplinary research lab at Stanford University that offers a residential postdoctoral fellowship program for scientists and scholars studying "the five core social and behavioral disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology".

It is one of the (currently ten) members of Some Institutes for Advanced Study (SIAS). Its campus is  with ample space for hosting groups of researchers. It has 54 studies, meeting rooms, a conference hall, a kitchen, and dining room with a private chef.

Sarah Soule started as director of the center in September 2023.

History 
The center was founded in 1954 by the Ford Foundation. The American educator Ralph W. Tyler served as the center's first director from 1954 to 1966. Political scientist Margaret Levi was the director of the center from 2014 until 2022. 

The CASBS buildings were designed by William Wurster, a local architect.

Earlier, fellow selection was a closed process; new fellows were nominated by former fellows. However, since 2007, the center opened up the fellow selection process to applications. In 2008, it became an official part of Stanford University and reports to the Vice-Provost and Dean of Research.

Fellows 
Each class of fellows numbers about 40 people. In the first 40 years of its existence it supported about 2,000 scientists and scholars.
