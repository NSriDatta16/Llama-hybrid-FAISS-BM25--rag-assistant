Cebu Ferries was a shipping company based in Batangas City and Cebu City, Philippines.  Its hubs were Batangas Port in Batangas and Pier 4 in Cebu City. It is now part of 2GO Travel.

Formerly the shipping company was a subsidiary of William Gothong & Aboitiz, better known as WG&A. Cebu Ferries was created to operate the William Lines', Aboitiz Shipping's and Gothong Lines' large vessels after the three merged into WG&A. When WG&A split up, Jon Ramon Aboitiz retained Cebu Ferries and the shipping company’s sisters SuperCat Fast Ferry Corporation and SuperFerry. Carlos A. Gothong Lines went back to shipping. Cebu Ferries eventually became part of the Aboitiz Transport System which was purchased by Negros Navigation, which in turn was purchased by the Chinese government through its wholly owned private equity firm the China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund and renamed 2GO Travel.
