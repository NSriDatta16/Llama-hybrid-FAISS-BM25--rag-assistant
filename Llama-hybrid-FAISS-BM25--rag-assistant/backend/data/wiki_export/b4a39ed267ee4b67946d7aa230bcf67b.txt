Glasgow Walker is a 2000 album by Scottish singer-songwriter John Martyn. It was his first album to be written on a keyboard rather than a guitar, after a suggestion from his friend Phil Collins. It contains trip hop influences, which Martyn had experimented with on his earlier album And. Kathryn Williams is featured on backing vocals on "Can't Live Without" and "The Field of Play." The album was dedicated to Rod Woolnough.

Glasgow Walker peaked at No. 66 on the UK Albums Chart.

Critical reception
The Birmingham Post called the album "probably [Martyn's] most assured album in a decade, a moving, heart-on-sleeve affair that finds him in fine voice."
