Aura’s House is an online grassroots project, which raises funds for needy children and their families. Specifically, Aura’s House raises funds for housing, health, income generation, and education projects for needy children in developing countries.

 Aura’s House was originally created to raise $4,500 to build a safe, sturdy brick home for the founder's sponsored child, Aura Hernandez and her family in Guatemala. Since that goal was met in November 2004, Aura’s House began to launch other small projects in an effort to help bring big changes to the lives of families in developing countries.
  Aura's House has been working in conjunction with Children International since February 2003. 100% of donations go toward their projects and are 100% US Tax Deductible. All persons working at Aura’s House are volunteers who receive no form of monetary payment for their efforts.

History 
 Aura's House originally began in February 2003 when Kristen Palana, a Professor of Digital Media at William Paterson University in New Jersey was learning PHP programming and adding dynamic content to websites. Kristen wanted to originally use the site to raise $4500 to build a sturdy brick home for her sponsored child, Aura in Guatemala with the help of Children International. After waiting over a year for all the required permissions from Children International, finally on June 30, 2004 the site was ready to launch.
 Aura's House has raised money for children and their families in the following countries: Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ghana, Zambia, Kenya, India, the Philippines, and the United States.
