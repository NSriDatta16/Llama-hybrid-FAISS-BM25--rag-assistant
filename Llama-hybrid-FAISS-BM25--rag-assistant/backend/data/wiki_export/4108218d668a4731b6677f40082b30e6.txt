The Kamehameha Schools Hawaii Campus consists of an elementary, middle and high school operated by Kamehameha Schools on the island of Hawaii.

History
The first campus was built in the Kapālama area of Honolulu, then a Maui Campus, and finally, the Hawaii Island Campus. Plans were announced in 1999 to move from a smaller temporary campus.

Located in Keaau, roughly  from the seaside port town of Hilo, Hawaii, the Hawaii island campus opened in August 2001. As of 2006, the  campus served approximately 1,120 students from grades K-12. Students attend from the entire island, although those on the western side between Paauilo and Naālehu have the option of apply to the main Kapālama Campus as boarders.

The Keaau campus is located on land formerly owned by William Herbert Shipman, who, along with Captain Elders and Samuel M. Damon, acquired the property in 1881 when it was auctioned by the estate of King Lunalilo, a grandnephew of King Kamehameha I.

In addition to classroom buildings at the elementary and middle school division, shared buildings include a learning center, administration building, and a cafeteria/band facility. 
Construction of the Hawaii Campus cost roughly $225 million.
Like its sister campus in Pukalani on Maui, the Hawaii Campus graduated its first class in 2006. Ninia M. E. Aldrich became principal of the high school in 2002. About 100 students were in the first high school class in 2002.

Ho'olaule'a: Every year the school puts on a Hoolaulea which consists of games, foods, booths by local vendors, entertainment from the elementary choir, and a local band.

Curriculum

The forestry, geologic, marine life, and agricultural aspects of the island also play an important role in the curriculum.
