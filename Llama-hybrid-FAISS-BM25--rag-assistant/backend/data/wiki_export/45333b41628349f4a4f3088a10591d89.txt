Börse Berlin after the  Second World War 

After the war, the Berlin Stock Exchange in West Berlin was reopened. However, with all major corporations and banks leaving the city, the stock market never regained the importance it had before the war.

In order to address internationalisation and growing consolidation pressure, Börse Berlin has pursued a successful niche strategy since the mid-nineties, with a particular focus on trading the widest possible range of foreign stocks and bonds.

In September 2007 Börse Berlin takes a majority stake in EASDAQ NV which operates under the brand Equiduct. With the pan-European market model of Equiduct, Börse Berlin re-positions itself as a Start-up. The key requirement of MiFID – best execution – is guaranteed by Equiduct, order by order. The launch of the Equiduct market place takes place on 20 March 2009.

On 21 July 2009 Equiduct enters into a strategic partnership with Citadel Securities, a division of Citadel Investment Group, L.L.C.. The agreement between Citadel Securities and Börse Berlin AG will provide funding to Equiduct for developing its platform into one of Europe's leading execution venues. Equiduct will continue to be operated by Börse Berlin AG, trading takes place on the newly created market segment Berlin Second Regulated Market (BSRM).

In October 2019 the stock exchange operator Tradegate Exchange GmbH announces the completion of an asset deal to acquire 100 percent of the shares in the Berlin Börse AG, the operating company of the traditional Berlin Stock Exchange and the London-based platform, Equiduct. In return the previous owner of the Berlin Börse AG, the Verein Berliner Börse e.V., receives a stake in the Tradegate Exchange GmbH. In future the three exchanges geared to the needs of private investors Tradegate Exchange, Börse Berlin and Equiduct will be operated and further developed under one roof.
