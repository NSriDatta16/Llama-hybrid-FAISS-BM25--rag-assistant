History
Nimta-Birati area was a well known Janapada since the days of Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury. Later after his death in 1649, it became the capital of Laksmikanta's jagir and remained the administrative headquarters till 1716 when the capital was shifted to Barisha. Still Birati remains an abode of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family. In ancient India, Birati used to be a part of Greater 24 parganas which were then under the Satgaon (formerly known as Saptagram, now in Hoogly district) administration during the Mughal regime. During Murshid Quli Khan the whole of Greater 24 Parganas including Birati, Rajarhat, Madhyamgram, Khaspur, Ikhtiarpur, Kalikata, Bagjola, Muragaccha, Shahpur and many other regions were included in Hoogly Chakla district. Post Battle of Plassey, Nawab Mir Jafar conferred the zamindari of 24 Parganas and other small administrative units to the British East India Company in the year 1757.
