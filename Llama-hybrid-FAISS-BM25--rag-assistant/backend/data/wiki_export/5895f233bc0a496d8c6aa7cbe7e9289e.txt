The Miss Hawaii USA competition, previously known as Miss Hawaii Universe, is a beauty pageant that selects the representative for the state of Hawaii in the Miss USA pageant.

Savannah Gankiewicz of Wailea was crowned Miss Hawaii USA 2023 on January 15, 2023 at Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu.

History
Hawaii is the most recent state to participate in Miss USA, first competing in 1962. Prior to being admitted to full statehood in 1959, it sent delegates to Miss Universe. Despite the late start, it has been one of the most successful: Hawaii's first Miss Hawaii USA, Macel Wilson, won the Miss USA title. Four Miss USA winners came from Hawaii, one of four states with four titles (only second to Texas and California). Though many Miss USA winners and semifinalists came from Hawaii, relatively few have placed as runners-up. Two previously competed at Miss Teen USA. Kelly Hu, Miss Teen USA 1985, became the first Miss Teen USA winner to win a Miss title, in 1993.

Many Miss Hawaii USA titleholders competed at a number of international pageants. Similar to Miss South Carolina USA, there was one Miss Hawaii USA that competed at Miss World. Another one competed at Miss International. Four of the winners competed at Miss Universe, after winning Miss USA. Six titleholders represented the United States or Hawaii at major international pageants, with Miss Hawaii USA 1997, Brook Lee, winning the title of Miss USA 1997 and capturing the crown of Miss Universe 1997, one of only 8 Miss USA winners to become Miss Universe in the history of the pageant.
