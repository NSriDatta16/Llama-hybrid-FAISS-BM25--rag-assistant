Plot
In a small Quebec community at the end of the 19th century, due to her father's financial hardships, Donalda Laloge (Vanasse) is forced to marry the village miser (also the mayor), Séraphin Poudrier (Lebeau), and to leave behind the young man that she truly loves. Her beloved, Alexis (Roy Dupuis), returns from working at the lumber camps, unaware of these events.

Donalda is extremely unhappy living with Séraphin, as his miserly lifestyle is often at the expense of her personal well-being. This includes refusing to father children, and severely rationing meals. Donalda becomes very sick with a pneumonia-like illness. Alexis returns home meanwhile, and his realizing of the situation sparks tension among the villagers.  Donalda dies from the disease shortly after his arrival. During Donalda's funeral, Séraphin realizes his home is on fire. He panics and runs into the blaze, succumbing to the flames as he attempts to save his wealth. Alexis pulls him out of the burning house. The villagers pry open Séraphin's hands, which are revealed to have been clutching coins.
