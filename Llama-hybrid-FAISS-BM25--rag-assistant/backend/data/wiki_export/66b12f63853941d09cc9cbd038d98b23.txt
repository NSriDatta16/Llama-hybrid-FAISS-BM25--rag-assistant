Zoran Pavlović (born 27 June 1976) is a former Slovenian footballer who played as a midfielder.

Club career
Although he was born in Tuzla, Pavlović's family moved to Velenje when he was young. He started his career at Rudar Velenje, making his first appearance in the Slovenian PrvaLiga during the 1994–95 season. Later, he played with Dinamo Zagreb, Austria Wien, Vorskla Poltava, Olimpija, Nafta Lendava, and Interblock.
In the 2008–09 season, he played for and captained Maribor. After a string of poor results and a dispute with fans, he left the club in October 2009. He later signed on a combined player-sporting director contract with Drava Ptuj. He left the club in April 2010, allegedly due to a conflict surrounding the sacking of manager Milko Djurovski whom he had brought to the club only months before. In January 2012, he signed a contract as a player for Styrian amateur team SV Schwanberg.

International career

Pavlović played 21 matches for the Slovenia national team and was a participant at the Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup.
