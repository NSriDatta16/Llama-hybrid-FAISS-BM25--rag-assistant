Microbrachis  is an extinct genus of lepospondyl amphibian from the Carboniferous Kladno Formation of the Czech Republic.

Description 
 
Microbrachis was an elongated, salamander-like creature, about  long, with over 40 vertebrae instead of the average 15–26 in its living relatives. It had minute limbs, and probably swam using fish-like lateral body movements. Microbrachis probably fed on fresh water plankton such as shrimp. Microbrachis was pedomorphic, retaining its larval gills in adulthood. Similar traits are found in the extant axolotl.
