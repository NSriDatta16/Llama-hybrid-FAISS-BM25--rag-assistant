The school caters for approximately 1,400 students from early learning to Year 12 and is divided into three sections: Junior School, Middle School, and Senior School.

The principal of the Pacific Hills Christian School is Edwin J. Boyce OAM, who has led the school since 1985.

History
Pacific Hills Christian School can trace its origins back to the early 1970s, when it was first established as the Pennant Hills Christian School, with just eight students and one teacher, Lynn McCrindle. At this time the school was located in two rooms of Lutanda Children's Home, an orphanage at Pennant Hills.

By 1980, enrolments had grown to 41 students with just two staff members. The following year saw the introduction of secondary education, and the first students with disabilities integrated into mainstream education. 1983 saw the appointment of the school's first principal, Ken Oliver. Boyce was appointed as principal in 1985.

In 1986, the school moved to its current location at Dural and subsequently changed its name to Pacific Hills Christian School. That year also saw the first year 12 class sit for the NSW Higher School Certificate.

Since its relocation, the school has purchased further land and constructed additional buildings and sporting facilities. Today the school is located on a  campus.
