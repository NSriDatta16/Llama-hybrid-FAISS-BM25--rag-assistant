Murray Markin (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada.  He served on the North York city council from 1976 to 1978, and campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1977.  His late brother, Joseph Markin, served on North York's Board of Control from 1974 to 1976.

Politics
Markin was twenty-seven years old when he was elected to the North York council in 1976.  He listed himself as a political researcher, and campaigned in support of neighbourhood preservation and completion of the Spadina Expressway.  Markin found himself at the centre of controversy during this campaign when seventy-three work orders were mandated for a tenant house that he had recently purchased from a family-owned business.  After his election, he served on the North York planning board and legislation committee.

While serving as an alderman, he also campaigned for the riding of Wilson Heights in the 1977 provincial election as a Liberal candidate.  He was hospitalized near the end of the campaign, after a large dog chased him down a street where he was canvassing and caused him to trip over a sewer grate. He lost to Progressive Conservative candidate David Rotenberg by 4,235 votes.

Markin was often critical of what he considered inappropriate council spending.  He wrote a letter to Toronto Transit Commission chairman Gordon Hurlburt in early 1978, arguing that the cost of a subway art and architecture preview was unwarranted.  He also suggested that a pay increase for aldermen be deferred to hire a new secretary for the aldermen's offices.

In August 1978, Markin and North York Mayor Mel Lastman presented a $1,000 audio-visual presentation to the mayor and council of Wroc≈Çaw, Poland on the "culture, history and topography of North York".  The meeting was intended as a visit of friendship between the cities.

He lost his council seat to Howard Moscoe in 1978. He was appointed to the North York planning board later in the same year.  He served in this capacity until 1984.

Later life
Markin was arrested on December 9, 1982, after agreeing to sell $3,000 worth of cocaine to an undercover police officer.  In July 1984, he was found guilty of trafficking cocaine and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.  The presiding judge determined that Markin had advertised himself to the officer as a major player in the cocaine business, but found that there was no solid evidence to back up this claim.  Markin was working for a Jewish community organization for disadvantaged children at the time of his conviction, and his fall was a surprise to many in the community.  He was described as a political science graduate at the time of his conviction.
