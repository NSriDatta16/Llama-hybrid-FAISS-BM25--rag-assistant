Plot
Sivakasi is a welder who meets Hema and they fall in love after multiple incidents. Hema's father approves of the marriage, but her brothers remark that Sivakasi's current income is not enough to support Hema, causing him to throw them out of the house. Hema confronts Sivakasi, who remarks that he couldn't understand his siblings as he was an orphan. Sivakasi reveals his real name as Muthappa and was falsely blamed for setting off crackers near a possessed dancer 15 years earlier, which was actually done by his brother Udhayappan. Hema berates him for ignoring his parents' love and declares they will marry only with his family's request. Sivakasi returns to his village and discovers Udhayappan is now a MLA due to his mother-in-law Moolimungaari's influence. 

Sivakasi's mother Thangam works as a servant in her own house and his sister Vairam operates a roadside stall in a nearby village in utter poverty with her husband Ramalingam and daughter Divya. Sivakasi decided to improve their lot anonymously. One of his few confidants tells how his father Meiyappan died when Udhayappan claimed that Thangam had affairs. Enraged, Sivakasi beats up Udhayappan and his men, using a fake identity. Udhayappan tries to sell off the ancestral property, but Sivakasi reminds the buyers that without Muthappa's signature, the sale is illegal. To avoid this, Udhayappan dresses a false body to look like Muthappa, but Sivakasi inserts a note saying his share of the property should be donated. The note is found valid and Udhayappan reveals his deception. Later, Udhayappan registers his MLA candidacy but finds Vairam contesting, supported by Sivakasi's money. 

Furious about Sivakasi, Udhayappan is visited by Hema and Sivakasi's friends who are looking for him. Udhayappan goes to Sivakasi's house thinking that he knows his identity. It is revealed that Hema lied that Muthappa and Sivakasi are friends. Udhayappan threatens to kill Thangam and although Sivakasi burns his palms, he and Vairam decide to leave. At night, Vairam sees Ramalingam getting kidnapped by someone assuming that he is Udhayappan, but is actually Sivakasi. When Vairam confronts her Udhayappan, he hits her which gains her sympathy votes. Sivakasi fakes a threat by Udhayappan towards Vairam, resulting in Udhayappan's men attacking the villagers. The people turn against him and Moolimungari, who is covered in cow dung for making Udhayappan an MLA. 

Moolimungari threatens Udhayappan with dire consequences, Udhayappan plans to kill his wife Kayalvizhi and frame Sivakasi to gain votes, but Sivakasi saves her. Sivakasi secretly burns a body with Ramalingam's chain, making everyone think Udhayappan killed him. The people riot outside his house. Sivakasi calls him, saying he can have Ramalingam back, but must hand over all ancestral property to her. Udhayappan signs it, thinking Muthappa cannot sign and finds one of his men. Vairam wins the election and property, where she and her mother regain their old state. Sivakasi releases Ramalingam and Kayalvizhi. Udhayappan hears that Muthappa has arrived, who is revealed to Vairam and her mother to be Sivakasi. An angry Moolimungari decides to kill Udhayappan, who decides to kill his brother. Moolimungari's men arrive and are about to kill Udhayappan. When Thangam asks Sivakasi/Muthappa to save him, Sivakasi/Muthappa rescues Udhayappan, who later begs for forgiveness for his actions and reunites with Kayalvizhi. Muthappa and Hema get married.

Ananda Vikatan rated the film 42 out of 100. Indiaglitz wrote: "Sivakasi is one among the long line of formulaic masala mass entertainers that Vijay is now known to dish out. In Perarasu, Vijay has got a director who understands the hero as well as his fans". Behindwoods wrote: "The movie is worth seeing as it includes sentiment and entertainment. It is an action paired entertainer and worth considering". Sify wrote: "This FORMULA had worked well for director Perarasu and Vijay in Tirupachi and now the team has re-worked it. This time, however, it will test your patience as it is not meant for the class audience or those seeking quality entertainment. Perarasu and Vijay believe only in catering to the mass audience who want their dose of unpretentious masala mix". A critic from Kungumam wrote that "Milk tastes better with a little water. Perarasu exchanged water for raw alcohol. Even though there are a thousand confusions, the truth is you get the feeling of lighting ten thousand fire crackers". The Film ran 150 Days in Theatres.
