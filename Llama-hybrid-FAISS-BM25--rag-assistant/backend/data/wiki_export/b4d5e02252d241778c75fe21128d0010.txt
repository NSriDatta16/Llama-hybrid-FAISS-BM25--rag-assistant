History
Mt. Carmel High School was built in 1974, with its first fall semester classes being held at the neighboring Black Mountain Middle School while the rest of construction finished.

In 1999, the movie Bring It On filmed on the campus, with the locker room, weight room and football scoreboard making it into the film.

In the spring of 2004, after the passage of California Proposition U and funds approved by district voters, the school received funding for a major renovation which took place from 2004 to 2007. In addition to modernizing existing buildings, including the practical arts and sciences departments, the project constructed several new buildings, including a new facility for the wrestling and gymnastics teams, and a new band room. The "Theater at the Mount" was the last main building that was under construction, completed in September 2007, along with the choir and drama rooms.

Enrollment 
As of 2019-2020, the total number of students enrolled is 1,898 students. Breaking down the number of students by grade level, 438 students in 9th, 480 in 10th, 485 in 11th, and 475 in 12th. The student body is 39.1% White, 24.7% Asian, 18% Hispanic or Latino, 3.3% Black or African American, 0.6% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 0.2% American Indian or Alaska Native.

Stadium
Mt. Carmel's on-campus football field, Sundevil Stadium, is a multi-purpose venue designed for football, soccer, lacrosse, track and field, and the annual Mt. Carmel Tournament of Bands, which is held on the 3rd Saturday of each October. The stadium was designed in 1971 and opened in 1977, with a capacity of 6,000. The Mt. Carmel football team's successes in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought Sundevil Stadium its first, and to date, only major renovation after the 1991 season, adding seats to both the home and visitor sides, raising total capacity to 11,000, making it the largest on-campus high school stadium in the state of California. Following the 2002-2003 school year, and in conjunction with the other major upgrades to the school, the natural grass field was removed and artificial turf installed. Renovations started in August 2009 and completed in July 2010 added handicap accessibility to every section in the stadium, handrails were put on every staircase, plus handicap seating was installed at the top of sections 2, 3, 5, 9, and 11. 
In August 2007, the stadium was the host of a Drum Corps International competition featuring Phantom Regiment, Carolina Crown, The Colts, Spirit from JSU, Blue Stars, Madison Scouts, Pacific Crest, and Pioneer.
