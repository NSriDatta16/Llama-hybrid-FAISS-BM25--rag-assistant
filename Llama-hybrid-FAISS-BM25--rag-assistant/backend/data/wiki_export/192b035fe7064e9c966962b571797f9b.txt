Culture and Attractions

Museum 
 Railway Museum
The first railway museum in Germany, operated since 1966 by the German Railway Association (Deutscher Eisenbahn-Verein), runs a tourist railway (heritage railway) from Bruchhausen-Vilsen to Asendorf on weekends and holidays from May to September. The museum presents exhibits on various train subjects and has an extensive railway car collection (about 100 vehicles).

Borgward service
 
The little town is home to what is claimed to be the world's only surviving Borgward garage/service centre, operated by a father-and-son team of enthusiasts.   Borgward was an automobile manufacturer, based in nearby Bremen, which ceased trading under controversial circumstances in 1961, but the cars, notably the Isabella model became an iconic symbol of Germany's economic miracle, and continue to generate passion, even though only between 2,000 and 3,000 Borgwards are now (2014) thought to survive worldwide.   The Borgward service centre in Bruchhausen-Vilsen operates from premises that consciously hark back Borgward's own glory days in the 1950s.   The business claims to have 70 regular customers and is proud to use "experience in place of a computer driven diagnostic centre", pointing out that a lot of mechanical diagnosis can be done simply by listening to the noise from the engine ("Vieles kann man schon am Motorengeräusch hören").
