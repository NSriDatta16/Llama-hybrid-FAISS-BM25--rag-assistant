History 

In 1957, the San Mateo Junior College District Board of Trustees developed a 25-year district master plan based on the recommendations of a citizens' advisory committee, and the same year submitted a $5.9 million bond issue to voters that was approved by a three-to-one margin.

The bond issue victory cleared the way for prompt acquisition of the present College of San Mateo campus and also provided funds for purchase of a  site west of Skyline Boulevard and south of Sharp Park Road in San Bruno. A third site of  west of the Farm Hill subdivision on the Redwood City-Woodside line, was purchased in 1962.

The current College of San Mateo campus was opened in 1963, followed by Cañada College in 1968, and Skyline College, San Bruno, in 1969. Construction of Cañada and Skyline was made possible in large part from proceeds from a second bond issue of $12.8 million approved by district voters in March, 1964.

Educational and architectural planning for Cañada was accomplished in 1964-66 and proceeded on the theory that a first phase for at least 2,000 students should be designed to permit expansion ultimately to 8,000 day students. Grading of the site began in 1966, and the building construction contract was awarded in April, 1967. The first classes – for 2,000 students – were held in September, 1968.

Cañada College is named after Cañada road that connects the college to Crystal Springs Reservoir to the North and Woodside, California to the South. The name Cañada is Spanish for a small canyon, glen, or ravine. The ravine is now filled with drinking water.
