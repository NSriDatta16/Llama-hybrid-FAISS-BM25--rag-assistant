Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch (also known as Air Bud 4) is a 2002 sports comedy film directed by Robert Vince. It is the fourth film in the Air Bud series and the final one to feature any cast members from the original film.

Plot

Josh is off to his first year of college and Buddy has stayed behind with Josh's little sister, Andrea, and the rest of the family. Jackie and Patrick have recently welcomed Josh and Andrea's half-brother Noah. Andrea, attempting to fit in with her junior high classmates, decides to join the baseball team. Along the way she discovers that Buddy also has the uncanny ability to play baseball. Just as the season is settling in, a terrible discovery is made â€” many local athletically talented dogs have mysteriously started disappearing with the help of the kidnappers' little helper, Rocky Raccoon. It turns out the kidnappers were researchers who were dognapping them because they thought they had a special gene that would enable them to play sports. Buddy must find them and make it to the major leagues as he goes to bat for the Anaheim Angels.
