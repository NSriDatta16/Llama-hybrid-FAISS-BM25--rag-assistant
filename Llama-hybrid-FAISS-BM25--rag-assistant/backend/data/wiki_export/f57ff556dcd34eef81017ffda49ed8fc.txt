Tynnered is one of 21 boroughs in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. It is located in the western part of the city, about 8-10 kilometres from the inner city, and it has a population of 27,787 (2010) on 29.85 square kilometres (11.53 mi2). Alike several other boroughs of the city, Tynnered has a fairly high percentage of immigrants.

In 2021 the stadsdelsnämd districts were replaced by larger stadsområde districts and Tynnered became part of South-West Gothenburg (Sydväst Göteborg).

History 
In the middle of the 60's, the area around Opaltorget and several other apartment blocks in Tynnered were started to be built. This venture, which is called Million Programme (Miljonprogrammet), was made in order to furbish up the area and make it more friendly to live in.

During the fall 2009, the local district publicly published new plans for Tynnered. Approximately 500-600 new apartments, premises for shops and refurbishing of streets are included in the project. Opaltorget is also to be developed into a vibrant town square for service and local shopping. One of the reasons to this project is that Opaltorget has been seen as an unsafe and dark square, according to Gothenburg municipality. Later in the same year, the real estate committee approved of the proposal. The project is expected to start being built in 2013.

In its 2017 report, Police in Sweden placed the district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. In 2021, it moved to the middle category of Risk area.

Demographics 
The population has increased with only circa 500 people the last ten years. In Tynnered, almost 34% of the inhabitants are younger than 25 years old.

In principle have the inhabitants of Tynnered generally work, income and health like the rest of the people in Gothenburg. Due to the lack of workplaces in the borough, most employees work in other parts of the city. The turnout during Swedish general election 2006 was higher than in Gothenburg in general.
