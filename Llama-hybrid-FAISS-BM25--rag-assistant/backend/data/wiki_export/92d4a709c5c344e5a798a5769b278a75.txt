Asbjørn Ruud (6 October 1919 – 26 March 1989) was a Norwegian ski jumper. Together with his brothers Birger and Sigmund he dominated international ski jumping in the 1930s. Ruud won a gold medal at the 1938 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. Eight years later, he won the ski jumping competition at the Holmenkollen ski festival, the first held since the German occupation of Norway in 1940 during World War II. At the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, Ruud finished seventh in the individual large hill competition. He won the Holmenkollen medal for ski jumping in 1948, the second of the three Ruud brothers to do so.
