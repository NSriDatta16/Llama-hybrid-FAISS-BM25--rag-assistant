The 12th World Cup season began in December 1977 and concluded in March 1978.  Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden won his third consecutive overall title.  Hanni Wenzel of Liechtenstein won the women's overall title.

A break in the schedule was for the 1978 World Championships, held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Bavaria, West Germany, between 29 January and 5 February 1978.

During this season, no combined races were included in the World Cup. Combined was resumed in the following season 1978/79.  A demonstration parallel slalom race was run as the last race of the season, in Arosa, Switzerland on 19 March 1978, but it did not count in the official standings for either men or women.  However, it became the model for a season-ending team parallel slalom race to be run as a part of the season-ending events.
