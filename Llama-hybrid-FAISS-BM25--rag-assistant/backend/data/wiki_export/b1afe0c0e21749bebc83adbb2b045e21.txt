Early, personal life and education
Howard Morley Sachar was born to historian and academic administrator Abram L. Sachar and his wife, Thelma Horwitz, during his father's tenure as a professor of history at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, and raised in Champaign, Illinois. He was the eldest of three brothers; his brother Edward J. Sachar became a pioneering biological psychiatrist and David B. Sachar became a gastroenterologist.

Sachar completed his undergraduate education at Swarthmore College and earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in history at Harvard University.
