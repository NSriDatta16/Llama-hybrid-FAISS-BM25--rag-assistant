Igor Mitreski (; born 19 February 1979) is a Macedonian former professional footballer who played as a defender.

Club career 
Mitreski was born in Struga. In early 2005, he was recognized as a featured member of Bayern Munich and later was near to signing for Portsmouth. On 6 November he was suspended from the first team from Energie Cottbus. On 9 January 2009, he was loaned out to the Belgian team Germinal Beerschot.

One year later, in January 2010, Bulgarian CSKA Sofia signed Mitreski to a two-year deal for a €300,000.

Mitreski and CSKA Sofia mutually agreed to terminate Mitreski's contract as he was no longer in their plans and Mitreski no longer had the desire to play for CSKA Sofia.

Mitreski signed a two-year deal with Neftchi Baku from Azerbaijan on 9 July 2010.
