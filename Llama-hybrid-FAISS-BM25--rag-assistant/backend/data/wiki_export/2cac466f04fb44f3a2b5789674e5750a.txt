Porsuigieco is the only album by PorSuiGieco, a supergroup consisting of Charly García, Nito Mestre, León Gieco, Raúl Porchetto and María Rosa Yorio, released in 1976. In the first edition of the LP, the song "Antes de Gira" was substituted for a censured song: "El fantasma de Canterville". But, in 1993, the album was released with "El fantasma de Canterville" as bonus track. The album was recorded in only two weeks.

In 2007, the Argentine edition of Rolling Stone ranked it 89th on its list of "The 100 Greatest Albums of National Rock".
