Scott Henderson (born 10 September 1969) is a Scottish professional golfer.

Henderson was born in Aberdeen. He worked as an engineer in the oil industry before turning professional in 1992.

Having won his place on the European Tour at the 1996 final qualifying school, Henderson was named as the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year in 1997. He also finished inside the top 100 on the European Tour Order of Merit the following season, but lost his card at the end of 1999. Having failed on many occasions to regain his playing privileges via qualifying school, except for two seasons on the second tier Challenge Tour, he has relied mainly on invitations since then.
