Railway

The falls location was a stopping point on the North East Dundas tram

The proximity of the line to the falls was described in 1926:

This little railway is a "show" line of the highest order, for it dives quickly amongst the mountains, brushing the fringe of immense forests, and at one point giving a near view, of the hand- some Montezuma Falls-so near that the spray actually dashes at times against the carriage win- dows. From Williamsford one can take a motor for the five miles to Rosebery.

The railway alignment, after closing of the operation, was used for trips to view the falls.
