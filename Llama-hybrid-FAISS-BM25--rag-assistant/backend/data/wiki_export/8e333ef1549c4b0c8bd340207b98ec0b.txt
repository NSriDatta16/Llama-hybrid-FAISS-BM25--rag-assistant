Paint and Paint is the second and final studio album by the British new wave band Haircut One Hundred, released in 1984 by Polydor Records. It was their only album released after the early 1983 departure of lead singer Nick Heyward. As a result, the band's percussionist, Marc Fox, assumed lead vocal duties. The band's longtime drummer Blair Cunningham performs on the album, but was not listed as an official member.

Unlike the band's first album, Paint and Paint was not a commercial success and failed to chart, and none of the singles released from it reached the UK top 40.
