The Connacht Senior Football Championship is an annual Gaelic football competition for the senior county teams of Connacht GAA. All of the counties of Connacht participate in the championship, as well as counties London and New York. The winning team receives the Nestor Cup.

The Connacht Senior Football Championship is run on a knock-out basis in which once a team loses they are eliminated from the competition. A series of games are played during the summer months and the final is played in June or July. The winners and runners-up progresses directly to the All-Ireland Group Stage. (before 2020, all losing teams progress to the All-Ireland Qualifiers and before 2001 the All-Ireland was a straight knock-out format meaning all losing teams were eliminated after a single defeat).

Galway are the two time title-holders, defeating Sligo by 2-20 to 0-12 in the 2023 final.

History 
Galway are Connacht's most successful county with 9 All Ireland titles. Roscommon have won the competition 24 times, most recently in 2019. Sligo have won the Nestor cup three times, most recently in 2007, while Leitrim have won the competition twice, most recently in 1994. The competing counties play for the JJ Nestor Cup, which is presented to the winning captain on Connacht Final Day.

London have competed in the Connacht Senior Football Championship since 1975, while New York joined in 1999. In this time London have managed three victories: one in 1977 and two in 2013, against Sligo and Leitrim. New York recorded their first and only victory in the championship over Leitrim in 2023.

Managers 

Managers in the Connacht Championship are involved in the day-to-day 
running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players from the club championships. Their influence varies from county-to-county and is related to the individual county boards. From 2018, all inter-county head coaches must be Award 2 qualified. The manager is assisted by a team of two or three selectors and an extensive backroom team consisting of various coaches. Prior to the development of the concept of a manager in the 1970s, teams were usually managed by a team of selectors with one member acting as chairman.
