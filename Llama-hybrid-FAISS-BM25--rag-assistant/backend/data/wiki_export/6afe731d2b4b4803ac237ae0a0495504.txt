Disaster convergence is the phenomenon of individuals or groups moving towards a disaster-stricken area. Convergers have many reasons for heading towards a disaster area. Kendra and Wachtendorf (2002) identified seven distinct categories of convergers. These categories are mourners, the anxious, returners, the curious, the helpers, the exploiters, and the supporters.
