Real Madrid (2003–2004)
Di Salvo was designated as fitness coach of Real Madrid's first team for the 2003–04 season. At that time Real Madrid won the Supercopa de España and included players such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Roberto Carlos.

Before the start of the 2004–05 season, Di Salvo was nominated by Sir Alex Ferguson as fitness coach of Manchester United and his contract was renewed for three more seasons, until 2010.

Real Madrid (2007–2009)
During his second experience with the Spanish club, Di Salvo held the position of director of the performance and medical area.
