Exploration Place is a science museum located on the west side of the Arkansas River in the Delano neighborhood of Wichita, Kansas, United States.  It is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution.

History
During the 1980s, a plan to consolidate the city-owned Wichita Omnisphere and Science Center and the Children's Museum of Wichita was proposed. In 1992, a capital funds campaign was launched, and with an endowment from Velma Lunt Wallace, funds from the City of Wichita and Sedgwick County, and other donations, the museum opened in the spring of 2000.

The museum is supported by admissions, membership dues, Sedgwick County government, and other public support and voluntary contributions from individuals, corporations and foundations.  In 2019 Exploration Place had attendance of 345,838, made up of 279,640 people visiting the facility and 66,198 people engaged through outreach programs.

Building
Construction began May 1997 and took 2 ½ years. Internationally acclaimed architect Moshe Safdie of Boston designed the building. There are  and  on the property. The tallest point of the building is the peak of the roof of the traveling exhibits space and is  above the floor (nearly 7 stories high). The combined distance around the interior perimeter of both buildings is approximately one mile.

The "Island Building" is named because it is surrounded by water, with the Arkansas River on one side and the reflecting pond on the other. The reflecting pond is between the buildings to create the illusion that looks like the river runs between the buildings. The reflecting pond is one to three feet deep. Even though the building is so close to the river it is not prone to flooding because it is above the 100-year flood level. During the flood in October 1998, the worst in recent history, the water level was still more than  below the finished floor level.

Digital Dome Theater and Planetarium
This venue is the largest dome theater in Kansas with a 60-foot high, 360-degree screen.  It shows digital films.  General museum admission is not required to see a show at the dome.

Kemper Creative Learning Studio
This venue is a 140-seat theater equipped with audio/visual equipment, sound system, podium and stage lighting. It is the home of live science shows.
