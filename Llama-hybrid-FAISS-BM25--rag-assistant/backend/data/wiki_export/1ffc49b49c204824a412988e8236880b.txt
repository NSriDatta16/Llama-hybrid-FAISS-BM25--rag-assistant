13P/Olbers is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 69 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with (20 years < period < 200 years). The comet had last been seen in 1956 and was recovered on 24 August 2023 by Alan Hale at Siding Spring Observatory, and then additional pre-recovery images from August 13 where located.

Discovery 
Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers discovered the comet on 6 March 1815 and it came to perihelion on 26 April 1815. Its orbit was first computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss on March 31 as parabolic, and Friedrich Bessel calculated an orbital period of 73.9 years using observations from June. Calculations by other astronomers during that era resulted anywhere between 72 and 77 years. Modern solutions give an orbital period of 74.9 years for the 1815 epoch. On 28 July 1887 the comet passed  from Mars and then passed perihelion on 8 October 1887.

2024 
On 16 November 2023 the comet will come to opposition 139 degrees from the Sun. It will then come to perihelion on June 30, 2024, when it will be 1.18 AU from the Sun and 1.94 AU from Earth. It is expected to brighten to about apparent magnitude 8.

2094 
Before the 2023 recovery, while the last observation was in 1956, Kinoshita calculated that the comet would come to a future perihelion passage (closest approach to the Sun) on 22 March 2094. Accounting for observations in 2023, the nominal time of perihelion passage is now calculated to be 15 March 2094.

There is some speculation that 13P/Olbers has an associated meteor shower on Mars coming from the direction of Beta Canis Majoris.
