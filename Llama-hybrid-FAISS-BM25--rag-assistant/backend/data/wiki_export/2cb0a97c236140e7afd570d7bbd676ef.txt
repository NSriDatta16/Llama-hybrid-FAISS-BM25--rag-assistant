Bradwell National Wildlife Area (NWA) 
Bradwell National Wildlife Area () is a  protected area established in 1968. It is in the RM of Blucher, about  south-east of Saskatoon. With the completion of the Gardiner Dam and Lake Diefenbaker in 1967, wetland habitat in the area was lost. Ducks Unlimited Canada was involved in a project with Canadian Wildlife Service to bring water to the marshes in the area to ensure stable water levels year-round. The water for Bradwell NWA is suppled by aqueduct from Lake Diefenbaker, which is about  to the south-west, and controlled by a series of dykes, ditches, and water control structures. Directly upstream in the aqueduct system is Blackstrap Lake and downstream is Bradwell Reservoir.

Bradwell NWA is in the Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion. The landscape has groves of trembling aspen and idled hayfields. A total of five wetlands are protected within the NWA and birds found there include the bobolink, horned grebe, redhead, canvasback, northern pintail, ruddy duck, lesser snow goose, white-fronted goose, marbled godwit, and the Wilson's phalarope.
