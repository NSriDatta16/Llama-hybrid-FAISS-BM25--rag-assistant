...And This Is Our Music is the ninth studio album by The Brian Jonestown Massacre, released on October 7, 2003, on Tee Pee Records. It was re-released on A Records, packaged alongside the "If Love Is the Drug, Then I Want to O.D" single, and was distributed in the UK through Cargo Records.

Reception 

AllMusic's Jo-Ann Greene called the album "the musical equivalent of a carnival fun house, one never knows what one will find upon opening the door".

Missing tracks

"The Wrong Way" and "The Right Way" appear only on the original pressing of the album. These tracks consist of short answering machine messages left for band leader Anton Newcombe. The first is left by Newcombe's obviously distraught friend, and the second is a far more consoling message from The Out Crowd's Sarah Jane. Permission was never granted to use these from the parties that left the messages, and due to this reason they were removed from subsequent versions of the album and do not appear on the version available for download from the band's website, though they do appear on the digital version available from Amazon and iTunes. The edition on the website also contains different mixes and different vocals on some tracks.
