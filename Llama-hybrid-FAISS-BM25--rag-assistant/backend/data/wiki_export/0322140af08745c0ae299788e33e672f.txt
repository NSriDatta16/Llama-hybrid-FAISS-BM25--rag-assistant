The village was first mentioned in the 14th century as Den Horn, and means "corner (of the dike) in the Schermer (polder)". Schermerhorn developed in the 13th century on the northern corner of the dike surrounding the former island . In 1635, it was connected to the main land and Alkmaar.

The Dutch Reformed church is a three aisled basilica-like church with a slender tower and needle spire. The church was built between 1634 and 1635. There are six polder mills and a wind mill museum in mill D in Schermerhorn. The museum has a glass floor in order to demonstrate the inner workings of a polder mill.
