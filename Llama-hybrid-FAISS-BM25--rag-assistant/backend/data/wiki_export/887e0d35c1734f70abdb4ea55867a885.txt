St Peter's College, Wexford is an Irish secondary school and former seminary located in Summerhill, overlooking Wexford town. It is a single-sex school for male pupils. Currently, the school's population is over 770.

History
Founded in 1811 by Most Rev. Patrick Ryan, Bishop of Ferns, the college has progressed from a Roman Catholic Seminary in Michael Street, Wexford to the present buildings. In 1818, the large house at Summerhill was purchased and Bishop Ryan blessed the foundation stone of an extension to be constructed to the rear of the house. In 1819, Bishop James Keating opened the new college and the President, staff and student body of Michael Street took up residence. Rev. Miles Murphy was the first president, he went on to become a Bishop. Expansion occurred for years afterwards and the impressive façade with its distinctive tower and the chapel designed by Augustus Welby Pugin were constructed. In 1855 the college became affiliated to the Catholic University of Ireland, in 1858 a theology course was offered to students. Up until 1897 students went on to finish their Theology and Philosophy courses at St Patrick's College, Maynooth, (or another seminary), but from 1901 students completed their studies in St. Peter's and were ordained. Over 160 priests ordained for American dioceses were trained in St. Peter's.

In 1938, due to increasing numbers of students, a seminary wing was added to facilitate expansion. This wing is now occupied by the Wexford Campus of Institute of Technology, Carlow. The Seminary closed in 1999 and the 10 remaining students for the priesthood transferred to other seminaries, and new construction work was completed in 2001. In 2009, a new building was completed,  €3.5 Million, the building links the two older sections of the school and provides many specialist rooms such as CAD rooms and Physics Labs.
In 1988 the Christian Media Trust, was set up in St. Peter's, with radio studios and production facilities; this is an interdenominational grouping including representatives from Wexford's Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian Churches.  The group's programmes are broadcast on South East Radio on 95.6 FM. The building of the studio at St. Peter's was financed by Dr. Comiskey and the Ferns Diocese.

In 2005 the college featured prominently in The Ferns Report enquiry into paedophile activities in the Roman Catholic Church in the Diocese of Ferns.

.
