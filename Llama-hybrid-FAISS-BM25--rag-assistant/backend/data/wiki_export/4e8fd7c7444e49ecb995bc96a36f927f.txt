The GS Caltex Maekyung Open, as it is known for sponsorship reasons, is a professional golf tournament that takes place in Seoul, South Korea. It was established in 1982, replacing the Korea Open as the South Korean event on the Asia Golf Circuit. Between 1999 and 2009 (except for 2004) it was a stop on the Asian Tour, and then in 2010 it became part of the OneAsia Tour schedule. Since 2018, it has again been a fixture on the Asian Tour, except for 2020 and 2021 due to restrictions in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2005, Korean Choi Sang-ho won the tournament and set an Asian Tour record as the oldest winner on tour at 50 years and 145 days. 

This tournament has generally been staged at the Nam Seoul Country Club. It has only been staged in four venues. The other venues that have been used are Lakeside in 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2006, Gwanak in 1984 and Elysian Gangchon in 2020.
