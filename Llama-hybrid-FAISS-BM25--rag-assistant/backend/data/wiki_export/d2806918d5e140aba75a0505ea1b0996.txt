Reconfiguration
Due to a loss of state aid the Board of Education announced in April 2023 a reconfiguration plan for the school district. Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year the Pitman Schools will be organized so that Memorial School serves grades PreK-1, Pitman Elementary School (housed at the former Pitman Middle School) will cover grades 2-6 and Pitman Junior/Senior High School will house students in grades 7-12.:

The students of W. C. K. Walls  Elementary School and Elwood Kindle Elementary School voted on the new name for their school and selected Pitman Elementary School. This name must still be approved by the Board of Education.
