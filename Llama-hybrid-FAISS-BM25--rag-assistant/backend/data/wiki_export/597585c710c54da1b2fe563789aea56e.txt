Yugoslav Radio Television (Jugoslavenska radiotelevizija/Југославенска радиотелевизија or Jugoslavenska radio-televizija/Југославенска радио-телевизија; JRT/ЈРТ) was the national public broadcasting system in the SFR Yugoslavia. It consisted of eight subnational radio and television broadcast centers with each one headquartered in one of the six constituent republics and two autonomous provinces of Yugoslavia.

History
JRT was one of the founding members of the European Broadcasting Union and the SFR Yugoslavia was the only socialist country among its founding members.

Among other activities, it organized the Yugoslavian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcast both events for the Yugoslav audience.

Each television center created its own programming independently, and some of them operated several channels. The system dissolved during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s when most republics became independent countries. As a result, the once subnational broadcasting centers became public broadcasters of the newly independent states, with altered names:

a. RTV Pristina still legally exist in Serbia as a dormant entity due to ongoing territorial dispute
