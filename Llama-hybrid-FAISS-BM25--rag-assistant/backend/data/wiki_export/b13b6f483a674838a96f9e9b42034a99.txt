Island Shangri-La, Hong Kong () is a five-star luxury hotel of Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts. It is located in Admiralty, Hong Kong and is the sister hotel to the Kowloon Shangri-La in Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon. It is housed within Two Pacific Place, a 213-metre, 57-storey skyscraper opened on 1 March 1991.

History 
The Island Shangri-La, Hong Kong was opened on 1 March 1991 as part of Pacific Place, a complex of office towers, hotels and a shopping centre at 88 Queensway in Admiralty. The hotel was part of phase two out of three, the initial phase having opened in 1988, and the final third phase in 2004. It contains 557 guestrooms which start at US$606 per night, of which 34 are suites which start at US$1,041 per night., spread through the top half of the tallest tower of the complex, which is 213 metres tall. The hotel also contains eight restaurants, a business centre, a 24-hour health club, a 645-square-metre ballroom, and seven function rooms. The bottom half of the tower contains office space, known as "Two Pacific Place".

Pacific Place contains three other luxury hotels: the Conrad Hong Kong, the JW Marriott Hotel Hong Kong, and The Upper House. The complex is directly connected to Admiralty station, which began operation in 1980 as part of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway.

Design and construction 
The hotel's interior was designed by Leese Robertson Freeman Designers. 771 Viennese chandeliers are used throughout the interior, while carpets are provided by Tai Ping, whose hand-knotted carpets are handwoven in independent factories in China and Nepal.

The proximity of Hong Kong Park, covering 80,000 m², has meant that the hotel has become popular with leisure travellers who are able to jog there in the mornings, according to former VP and GM Wolfgang Krueger.

Features

Art collection 
The Great Motherland of China, a silk painting composed of 250 panels, is the centrepiece of the hotel's art collection. It scales an internal wall of over 16 stories and can only be seen from within the hotel's inner atrium, stretching from the 41st to 56th floor and only accessible to guests. The painting was created by a team of 40 artists from Beijing and took six months to complete.

The hotel also holds a collection of over 700 artworks, and frequently hosts art fairs and auctions. As well as auctions in its ballroom by the likes of Bonhams that focus on contemporary Asian art, the hotel was also selected as the venue for art entrepreneur Dong Myeong Kim's Bank Art Fair, which showcased over 100 emerging Korean artists on floors 41 and 42 as part of Art Basel Hong Kong from 23–26 May 2013.
