Barua (also spelt as Baruah, Barooah, Baruwa, Baroova, Barooa, Baroowa, Borooah, Boruah, or Baroa) is a common Assamese surname. This term is different and not to be confused with the surname used by Bengali Buddhists from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Tripura, who also use Barua as surname.

History 
Originally, the Barua surname was used as a military rank in the Sutiya kingdom held by individuals from the Buruk clan. The historical examples, such as Borhuloi Barua, Gajraj Barua, Manik Chandra Barua and Kasitora Barua were Sutiya officials. 

During the Ahom reign, Barua represented by the Tai word Phu-ke(literally: "Leader of 10,000 men" in Ahom language), meant a superintending officer of the Paik system of the Ahom Army.

Appointments as Baruas were made irrespective of the paik's religion or ethnicity. Among other ethnic groups, there is mention of Sutiya Baruas in several instances of Buranjis. For example, there was a Sutiya revolt against the monarchy led by a Sutiya Barua in 1673. Ahom Barua was a position held by the family of the Sutiya Kataki who later joined the Ahoms after the defeat of Sutiyas; Kachari, Sonowal and Thengal Baruas were of Kachari origin, while others like Bapu, Bez and Dewalia Baruas were Brahmins. Besides these, during the Moamoria rebellion, the Matak rebels also appointed Baruas among themselves.

Present

The rank being granted to various people within the Assamese community found its place among the Ahoms, the Brahmins, the Kacharis (Sonowals and Thengals), the Kalitas, the Koch, the Morans, the Motoks, besides the Sutiyas.
