History 

The original school was built in 1956 when it was named after Garibaldi Provincial Park which was just to the North of the school. Later this part of the park became a separate park known as Golden Ears Provincial Park but the school kept the name Garibaldi Secondary School, so it is also named after Giuseppe Garibaldi. The school has completed its building program with new classrooms, science labs and computer labs.
