University High School is a public high school located in the city of Waco, Texas, part of Waco Independent School District and classified as a 5A school by the University Interscholastic League. It is one of two public high schools in Waco ISD, the other being Waco High School.

Originally named Waco Technical High School when it opened on Bagby Avenue in 1946, its name was changed in 1954. In 2008, citizens voted to approve a bond issue to build a new University campus, which opened for the 2011 school year. In the fall of 2012, it absorbed the district magnet school A.J. Moore Academy as a separate unit on its campus, with a full merger between the two in the 2013 school year. The career-track academies continue to bear the A.J. Moore name within University High.

In 2015, the school was rated "Met Standard" by the Texas Education Agency.
