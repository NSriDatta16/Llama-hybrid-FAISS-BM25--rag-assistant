The City of Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico is divided mainly into areas called Colonias, which incorporate residential and commercial elements.

Small general stores called abarrotes, which are 'Mom-and-Pop' operations, may be found in most neighbourhoods, along with other small businesses.  Industry, which was once found in the colonias as well, is now moving to the industrial parks in the city.
