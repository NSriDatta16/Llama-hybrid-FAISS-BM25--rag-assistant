Kegworth railway station  located in Nottinghamshire was a station serving the villages of Kegworth, Leicestershire, Sutton Bonington, and Kingston on Soar, Nottinghamshire.

History

It was opened in 1840 for the Midland Counties Railway, which shortly joined the North Midland Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway to form the Midland Railway.

This line is now part of the Midland Main Line between Loughborough and East Midlands Parkway railway station.

It was built in the typical MCR fashion, the main building positioned at a higher level and steps leading down onto the platform. It closed in 1968 and only the station house and the goods shed remain. Until 1971 there was a standard gauge mineral railway between the main line and  New Kingston gypsum mine.

There has been local pressure to open it. However a new station, East Midlands Parkway has now been built at Ratcliffe-on-Soar. Currently only taxis serve to connect it to the nearby East Midlands Airport, forcing the majority of people to use the Skylink (bus service) from Nottingham, Loughborough, Leicester or Derby, but with improvements to the Erewash Valley Line has the potential to be a hub for local services from Nottingham and Derby to connect with a high speed service from London to Sheffield and the North.
