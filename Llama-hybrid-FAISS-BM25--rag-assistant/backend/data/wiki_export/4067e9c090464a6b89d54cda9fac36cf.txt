NGC 4027 (also known as Arp 22) is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 83 million light-years away in the constellation Corvus.  It is also a peculiar galaxy because one of its spiral arms goes out more than the other.  This is probably due to a galactic collision in NGC 4027's past.

One supernova has been observed in NGC 4027: SN 1996W (type II, mag. 16).
