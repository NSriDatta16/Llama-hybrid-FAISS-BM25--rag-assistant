In February 2011, Ketron and State Rep. Judd Matheny introduced legislation to outlaw sharia law in the state.

In March 2013, Ketron and Matheny drew national attention after inquiring whether a new floor-level sink in the Tennessee state capitol had been installed to allow Muslims to wash their feet before praying. According to state officials, the sink is meant to make it easier for custodial staff to fill buckets and clean mops.

On May 1, 2018, Ketron won the Republican primary for the Rutherford County Mayoral nomination. Ketron won the August 2 general election, defeating his opponent Heather Ann Brown with 24,013 votes to her 14,575 votes. He was sworn into office on September 1, 2018.

In June 2018, a fraud complaint was filed against Universal International Insurance, of which Ketron is owner and president. The complaint alleges that the company's vice-president, Kelsey Ketron, fraudulently accepted payment for a homeowner's insurance policy, without obtaining the policy, and at a time when she did not possess a valid license to do so. A civil lawsuit is pending in Rutherford County Circuit Court against the company.
