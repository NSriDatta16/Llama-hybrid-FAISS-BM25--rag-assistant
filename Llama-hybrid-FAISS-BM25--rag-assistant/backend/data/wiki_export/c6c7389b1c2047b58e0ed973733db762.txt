Cargo is a Romanian heavy metal band from Timișoara.

Biography

Cargo was formed by Adrian Bărar in 1985, after he quit the new wave band Autostop. The original line-up was Tavi Iepan (guitar), Carol Bleich (drums), Tiberiu Gajdo (bass), Dinel Tollea (keyboards) and Adrian Bărar (guitar, vocals).

In 1988, the group recruited Ovidiu Ioncu "Kempes" as their new vocalist. He would stay with the band for the next 15 years, lending his voice to 4 full-length albums. During these years, Cargo toured the country extensively, playing numerous festivals, and receiving radio airplay, becoming the most well-known heavy metal band in the country.

In 2003, Kempes decided to leave the band, and emigrate to Australia, so the vocal duties were taken over by guitarist Adrian Igrișan. After considering to organize auditions for a new vocalist, they finally decided on leaving Igrișan to handle both guitar and vocals. With this line-up they recorded their 5th album, Spiritus Sanctus, which was released the same year. The power ballad "Dacă ploaia s-ar opri" received massive airplay on both radio and television, with Cargo becoming a household name in Romania. It is still one of the most commonly played tracks in Romanian media.

The band continues to play live, often being invited to play at large open-air events.
