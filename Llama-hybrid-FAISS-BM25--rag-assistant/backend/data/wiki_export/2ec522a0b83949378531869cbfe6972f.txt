The complex covers a total area of some 16,000 square metres.

Collections

Some items for the collection had already been acquired by the end of the 19th century. The present collection, which is one of the finest of its kind in the world, contains more than 100 locomotives, some 150 coaches, and several hundred other items of rolling stock. The best of these are displayed in the basic exhibition. Although most of the other items are kept in the stores, they are available for viewing by groups or by pre-arrangement.
