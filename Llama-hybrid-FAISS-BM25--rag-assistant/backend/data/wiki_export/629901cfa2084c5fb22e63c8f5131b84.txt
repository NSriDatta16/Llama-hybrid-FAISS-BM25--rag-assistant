The Saint-Omer Open is an annual men's professional golf tournament played at Saint-Omer Golf Club in Saint-Omer, France. The tournament was founded in 1997 and was part of the MasterCard Tour a year later, before taking its place on the Challenge Tour for the 2000 season.

In 2003 it also became an official money event on the European Tour, but since it was played during the same week as the U.S. Open (one of golf's four major championships), the tour's leading players were not available to play. It had the smallest purse available on the European Tour. It was removed from the European Tour schedule in 2014 but remained on the Challenge Tour.

In 2022, the event became part of the Alps Tour schedule.
