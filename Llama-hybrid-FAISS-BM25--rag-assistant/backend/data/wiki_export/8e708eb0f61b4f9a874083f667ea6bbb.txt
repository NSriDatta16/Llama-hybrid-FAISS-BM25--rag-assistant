Greater Noida is a planned city located in Gautam Buddha Nagar district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The city was created as an extension to Noida area under the UP Industrial Area Development Act, 1976. Situated  south-east of the capital city of New Delhi, it takes around 30 minutes to travel between the cities via the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. The city is administered by Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA).

Etymology 
Initially, developers coined the term ”Noida Extension” to differentiate it from Noida but also of was adjacent to the latter. The Greater Noida Authority later declared that the area would be referred to as 'Greater Noida West'.

History
In the early 1980s, the Government of India realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos. Hence, they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, two areas had been developed—Gurgaon, across the border from Haryana, and Noida, across the border with Uttar Pradesh. 

Greater Noida Notified Area – 38000 Ha (380 km2) comprising 124 villages. Noida's infrastructure was carefully laid out, but the 1990s saw huge growth in the Indian economy. Migration to cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore exceeded planning estimates. Noida was developed to accommodate population growth for 20–25 years. The massive population influx from Delhi, however, caused it to overload in a mere 15 years, although intake is not complete and illegal mining remains a problem.

The government of Uttar Pradesh decided to develop another city as an extension to Noida with better planning. The idea was to create a world-class town approximately 25 kilometers from Noida. A railway station near Boraki and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.

During the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of Gautam Buddh Nagar) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The Greater NOIDA Authority manages the development of the city. Greater Noida is connected to Agra by the six-lane Yamuna Expressway. The annual Indian Grand Prix is held at the Buddh International Circuit. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the Greek alphabet. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xi, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma  II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the Mainpuri conspiracy. A park has been named "Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.

The 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th Auto Expos (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014, 2016 and 2018, 2020 respectively. In 2018, Gamma 2 was officially declared as the capital of Greater Noida.
