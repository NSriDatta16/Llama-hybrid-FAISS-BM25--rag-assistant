History
Originally the act consisted of two childhood friends, James Baker and Phil Aslett. Due to differences between the pair however, it became entirely a solo project of Baker's in 1999, after the release of Exorcise the Demons.

They have released singles under the names Intensity, Sounds of Life, Oblivion, Mirage, X-Files and Hokusai.

Despite not being featured on the officially released soundtrack, Source Direct gained recognition for the track "Call & Response" which was used in the horror movie Blade. The track, originally a single, was later included on their EP Controlled Developments, and on their album Exorcise the Demons. Source Direct contributed the track "2097" to the CD soundtrack of the PlayStation game Wipeout 2097, released in 1996.
