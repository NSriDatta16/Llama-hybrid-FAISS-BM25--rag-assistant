Violent Silence is a Swedish progressive rock band. One of the more distinguishing features of the band is the fact that they include two keyboardists in the line-up and no guitarist. According to the German progressive rock site www.babyblaue-seiten.de, Violent Silence "has managed to create its own sound world and manage to sound both modern and timeless." The band's uniqueness has further brought it several positive reviews by a number of music magazines across the world, such as Eclipsed, Prog-RÃ©siste, and Sweden Rock Magazine. They have released three studio albums to date, Violent Silence in 2003, Kinetic in 2005 and A Broken Truce in 2013. In the summer of 2020 band leader Johan Hedman finally announced that the fourth album, named  Twilight Furies, would be released in november 2020.
