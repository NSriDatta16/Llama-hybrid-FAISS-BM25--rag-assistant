Double Trouble Historic Village
The Double Trouble Historic Village was originally a cranberry farm and packing plant. The Double Trouble Company was formed by Edward Crabbe in 1909 to sell timber, millwork products, and cranberries. Many sawmills have been in the town since the mid-18th century. The village consists of cranberry bogs and fourteen restored historic structures dating from the late 19th century through the early 20th century including a general store, a schoolhouse and houses. The sawmill was restored in 1995, and the cranberry sorting and packing house were completed in 1996.

The town was named for the fact that muskrats breached a local dam twice in one week.

Double Trouble Historic District
The Double Trouble Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1978 for its significance in agriculture and industry.

Cedar Creek
Cedar Creek's headwaters start from the Greenwood Forest Management Area to its mouth at Barnegat Bay. Cedar Creek provides the water needed for cranberry culture and provides a source of water for wildlife.

Trail
