Shanonn Jonell Showes, better known as Jonell (born was February 20, 1977), is an American contemporary R&B singer.

In 2001, Jonell was introduced with her first hit Round and Round on producer Hi-Tek's album Hi-Teknology, the remix featuring a guest appearance from Method Man soon landed on the How High soundtrack.  Later in 2003,  Jonell was set to release her debut album "Know Me" on the Def Soul label. Her first single So Whassup featured a guest appearance by Redman. However, the album was never released, and in 2005, her webpage on the Def Soul website was no longer accessible.

She resurfaced in late 2005 with a blog on MySpace, where she talked about working on her new album which never materialized.
