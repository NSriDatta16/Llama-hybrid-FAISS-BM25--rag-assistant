Old Portsmouth is a district of the city of Portsmouth. It is the area covered by the original medieval town of Portsmouth as planned by Jean de Gisors. It is situated in the south west corner of Portsea Island. The roads still largely follow their original layout.

The area contains many historic buildings including: Portsmouth Cathedral, Royal Garrison Church, The John Pounds Memorial Church (Unitarian), the Square Tower and Round Tower and Point Barracks, Portsmouth Point and the entrance to the Harbour. George Villiers Duke of Buckingham was assassinated in the Greyhound Pub in 1628. The area also has several historic pubs including the Bridge Tavern, Still and West, Spice Island Inn, and the Dolphin. The building Spice Island Inn occupies was previously two separate pubs.

The area is also home to Portsmouth's small fishing fleet and fish market at Camber docks.
