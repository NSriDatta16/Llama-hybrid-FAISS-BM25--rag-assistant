Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Laudal farm (Old Norse: Laugardalr), since that is the location of the church. The first element of the name of the farm comes from the old name for the river, Laug, (now the Lågåna river) and the last element (Old Norse: dalr) means "valley". Therefore, the name means "Laug river valley".
