Research 
In his book Grand Delusion: Stalin and the German Invasion of Russia (Yale University Press, 1999), Gorodetsky said that Stalin was committed to realpolitik and eager to improve the Soviet Union's national status. It had lost position as a result of the disasters during the First World War and the Russian Revolution. According to Gorodetsky, through the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Stalin believed he could bring about a change in the European balance of power. When he learnt through his intelligence of Hitler's aggressive intentions in late 1930s, he had no choice but to resort to appeasement, hoping he could either delay the war or reach a second agreement with Hitler. Stalin's purges of the 1930s had decapitated the military and left it in a dismal state.
