Primary care trusts were abolished on 31 March 2013 as part of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, with their commissioning work taken over by clinical commissioning groups.  Their public health role was transferred to local authorities and to Public Health England.  Their community service provision was distributed in various ways, some to community health trusts. This list is of the PCTs which existed in 2012.

History
In October 2006, all primary care trusts (PCTs) outside the London area were restructured.  This reduced the number of PCTs from 303 to 152. At the same time, the number of  strategic health authorities (SHAs) (which have responsibility for the PCTs) were also decreased (from 28 to 10). These ten new SHAs largely mimic the geography of the government office regions. The exception to this was the South East Government Office Region which is covered by two strategic health authorities: South Central SHA and South East Cost SHA.

The PCTs were organised into clusters so as to achieve management cost savings, although the PCTs themselves remained separate statutory bodies. Whilst the majority of clusters contained multiple PCTs, there were some clusters, such as Cumbria, which consisted of just a single primary care trust. In October 2011, the ten SHAs were also grouped into clusters, with each having its own executive team, chief executive, and directors. There were four SHA clusters, and these were London, North of England, NHS Midlands and East, and South of England.

As a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, all PCTs and SHAs were abolished on 31 March 2013, and replaced by clinical commissioning groups taking over the function of commissioning health and care services.

London 
NHS London was the strategic health authority for the capital, with responsibility for 31 PCTs which operated in five clusters. The PCTs were coterminous with London borough boundaries.
