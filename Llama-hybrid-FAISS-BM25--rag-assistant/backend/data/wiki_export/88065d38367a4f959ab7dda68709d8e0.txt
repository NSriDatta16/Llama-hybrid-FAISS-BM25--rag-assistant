Ezra Weisz is an American voice actor and ADR director who stars in various anime television shows.

Career
Weisz is a prolific voice actor in the anime community, having done voices in various anime shows such as Outlaw Star, The Big O, Rave Master, and Scryed. He is also well known for his past voice work in Saban live-action shows.

Some of his better known-roles there included Mantix (who was one of the dreaded Mantrons) in Beetleborgs Metallix, as well as Falkar (who was one of the three Fallen Angel, or Troika, demons) in Power Rangers: Lightspeed Rescue, and also the male voice of the Org General named Mandilok in Power Rangers: Wild Force (which was the last Power Rangers series to be filmed in America before it moved to New Zealand in 2003; the move laid off much of the original PR crew, including Weisz). Since then, his main focus has been anime. He co-directed the ADR for Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo alongside another voice actor, Michael Sorich. He is also the live-audience coach for Disney Channel shows, helping the teen and kid stars with them with improvisation on the set.

Personal life 
Since 1998, Weisz is married to Sabrina Hill. They have two children.
