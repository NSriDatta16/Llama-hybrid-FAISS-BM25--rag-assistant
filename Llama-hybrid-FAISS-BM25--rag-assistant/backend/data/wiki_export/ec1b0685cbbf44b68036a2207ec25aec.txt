Olive Deering (nee Corn; October 11, 1918 – March 22, 1986) was an American actress of film, television, and stage, active from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. She was a life member of The Actors Studio, as was her elder brother, Alfred Ryder.

Early life
Deering was the daughter of Zelda "Sadie" (née Baruchin) and Max Corn, a dentist.
 Her brother was actor Alfred Ryder. She began attending the Professional Children's School when she was age 11.

Career

Stage
Her first stage role was a walk-on bit in Girls in Uniform (1933). She appeared onstage in Moss Hart's Winged Victory, Richard II (starring Maurice Evans) and Counsellor-at-Law (starring Paul Muni). She received kudos for her performance in the Los Angeles production of Tennessee Williams's Suddenly Last Summer. Other stage appearances included No for an Answer, Ceremony of Innocence, Marathon '33, The Young Elizabeth, They Walk Alone, and Garden District.

In 1940, siblings Deering and Ryder co-starred in Medicine Show on Broadway. In 1980, Deering and Ryder appeared in The Harold Clurman Theater's production of Tennessee Williams' The Two-Character Play. Although Williams maintained an apartment across the street in the Manhattan Plaza, he did not attend a performance. Deering received good notices for the play.

Film

The films she appeared in included Shock Treatment and Caged. In 1948, director Cecil B. DeMille cast her as Miriam, the Danite girl who loves Samson, in his film Samson and Delilah. In his autobiography, DeMille wrote that Deering was "one whose talent and dedication to her art should carry her very far in the theater, whether on screen or stage." DeMille cast her again as the biblical Miriam, sister of Moses, in The Ten Commandments (1956).

Radio
Deering also appeared on many radio programs, which included  Lone Journey, True Story and Against the Storm, playing in more than 200 television programs, including Desdemona on the Philco Summer Playhouse production of Othello.
