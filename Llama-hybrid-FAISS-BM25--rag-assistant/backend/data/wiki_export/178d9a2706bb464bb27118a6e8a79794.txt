The Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency is a Single Member Constituency (SMC) in the central region of Singapore. The current Member of Parliament of the constituency is People's Action Party (PAP) Sitoh Yih Pin.

The constituency was first formed prior to the 1968 general election and was won by the People's Action Party (PAP) in its debut.

However, PAP's representation of Potong Pasir SMC last sixteen years, when it lost the seat to the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Chiam See Tong after an almost 19% swing during the 1984 general election.

In the 2006 general election,  Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong was tasked to help the PAP win back the two opposition wards of Hougang SMC and Potong Pasir SMC with a $100 million plan to upgrade the constituency. However, Chiam retained back the seat with 56% of the vote.

From 1984 to 2011, it was one of only two opposition-held (i.e. non-PAP) seats in Parliament.

During the 2011 general election, Chiam See Tong left to contest the nearby Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, Lina Chiam, who lost the seat with 49% of the vote.
