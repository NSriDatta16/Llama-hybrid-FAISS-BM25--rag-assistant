In general, colonias () are neighborhoods in Mexican cities, which have no jurisdictional autonomy or representation. Usually colonias are assigned a specific postal code; nonetheless, in recent urban developments, gated communities are also defined as colonias and share the postal code of adjacent neighborhoods. In spite of this, the name of the colonia must be specified when writing an address in large urban areas in Mexico.

It is a similar concept to the barangays of the Philippines.
