Spartanburg Day School is an independent, college preparatory 2K-12 school, located in unincorporated Spartanburg County, South Carolina, United States, with a Spartanburg post office address, in the Greenville-Spartanburg area. It consists of a lower school for 2K-4th graders, a middle school for 5th–8th graders, and an upper school for 9th–12th graders.

History 
Spartanburg Day School was established on September 12, 1957 at the Drayton Mill Community Building, with 35 students in 1st–5th grades. As more upper-level grades were needed, a new location for SDS was established on Skylyn Drive, where the school is currently located. In October 1962, the new campus was officially opened. The lower school did not move to the current campus until 1993.

When the families of foreign expatriates began moving to the Greenville-Spartanburg area in the 20th century, most of the children attended Spartanburg Country Day School.

Athletics 
Each student from grades 7 to 12 is required to participate in one athletic team each academic year. SDS offers cross country, volleyball, soccer, physical education, tennis, basketball, swimming, cheerleading, baseball, lacrosse, golf, and track and field. The school does not deny students from participating in its athletic programs due to inexperience or ability. SDS has enjoyed much athletic success in recent years, including back-to-back baseball SCISA championships in 2001 and 2002, as well as SCISA championship teams in men's and women's tennis.
