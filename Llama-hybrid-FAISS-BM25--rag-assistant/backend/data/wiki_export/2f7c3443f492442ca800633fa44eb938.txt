She's worked for a wide range of employers across multiple industries, including Deloitte, Aon, Revlon, Max Factor and Medco. Medoff attributes her success as a novelist to her corporate career, "Having steady, stable employment (i.e., a corporate job) not only offered [Medoff] financial security, it also ensured sheâ€™d never be forced to write solely as a means to pay rent."

She's fluent in HR practices and procedures, and has deep subject matter expertise in benefits and pay programs.
