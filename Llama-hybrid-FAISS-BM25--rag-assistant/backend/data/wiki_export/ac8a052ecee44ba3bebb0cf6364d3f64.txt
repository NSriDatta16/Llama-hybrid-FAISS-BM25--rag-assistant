Miguel Ángel Andreolo Frodella (6 September 1912 – 14 May 1981), known as Michele Andreolo (), was a Uruguayan Italian footballer who played as a midfielder. He was born in Dolores, Uruguay but his family was from Valle dell'Angelo in the province of Salerno. He was a member of the Italy team that won the 1938 FIFA World Cup.

Club career
Andreolo played for Nacional in Uruguay before joining Serie A team Bologna F.C. 1909 ahead of the 1935–36 season and helping them win the league title (Scudetto) that year. He would remain in Bologna until 1943, winning the Scudetto three more times, in 1936–37, 1938–39 and 1940–41.

Later in his career he played for Italian sides Lazio, Napoli, Catania and Forlì.

Following his success with Bologna, Andreolo was also called up to the Italy national team by Vittorio Pozzo and debuted on 17 May 1936 against Austria.
