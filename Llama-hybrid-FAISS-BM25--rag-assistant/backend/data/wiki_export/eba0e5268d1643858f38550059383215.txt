MEBEA was an important Greek vehicle manufacturer, producer of light trucks, passenger automobiles, motorcycles, motorbike engines, agricultural machinery and bicycles.

Activities 
MEBEA was founded in Athens in 1960 by the merger of two companies assembling (progressively manufacturing) motorbikes since 1954, and its initials stand for Μεσογειακαί Επιχειρήσεις Βιομηχανίας, Εμπορίου και Αντιπροσωπειών (Messogiakai Epiheiriseis Biomihanias, Emporiou kai Antiprosopeion - Mediterranean Enterprises for Industry, Commerce and Dealerships). It grew to be a significant Greek company with two factories in the north of Athens.

Its most successful products were light three-wheeler trucks with 50 cc Zündapp engines, that became a common sight all over the country for almost three decades and were exported (in commercial and passenger variants) to African and Asian markets. Its mopeds and motorcycles (models including the Junior, Apollon and Hermes) mostly used Zündapp engines as well as MEBEA's own (built under Minarelli licence), and some were used, among others, by the Greek Postal Service and the Telecommunications Organization.

Apart from the previously mentioned vehicles that were of its own development (MEBEA technology was also employed by another Greek motorcycle and three-wheeler manufacturer, Mego), the company cooperated with Reliant of Britain, starting licence production of the latter's TW9 heavier three-wheeler truck in 1970 (using a 1.2 L Triumph engine) and Robin three-wheel passenger car in 1974, while the MEBEA Fox automobile was presented as a joint development.

In addition to the motorized vehicle construction mentioned above, other activities during MEBEA history included motorbike engine production (on Italian designs) for use in its lighter models as well as for export, and the operation of the bicycle division producing a range of bicycle models.

Development and fate of the Fox model 
In 1979 MEBEA introduced the Fox light utility vehicle, in line with contemporary Greek 'fashion' for such vehicles like the Pony by Namco, the Farma by MAVA-Renault, and others that appeared later. The Fox was originally designed and built in prototype form by MEBEA itself on modified Reliant Kitten basis, but the final development for type certification was done in collaboration with Reliant in order to bypass the difficulties imposed by Greek law for a "passenger car" production permit.

The company faced problems in the early 1980s when certain Asian markets were lost, but the final blow came when Greek law stopped 'favouring' light passenger-utility vehicles, essentially killing the Fox (along with about half a dozen similar Greek automobiles) which until then had accomplished modest sales, reaching about 3000 units. In 1983 production of the Fox was terminated (it then started in Britain, though, by Reliant itself), and soon MEBEA, a company  associated with a wide variety of light vehicles that had almost become a part of Greek culture, ceased to exist.
