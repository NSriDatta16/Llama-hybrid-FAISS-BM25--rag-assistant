The Power Macintosh 8100 (also sold in Japan as the Power Macintosh 8115 and with bundled server software as the Workgroup Server 8150) is a personal computer that is a part of Apple Computer's Power Macintosh series of Macintosh computers. It was introduced in March 1994 alongside the Power Macintosh 6100 and the 7100 as the high end model of the first generation of the Power Macintosh family, and is a direct replacement of the prior Macintosh Quadra 800. It retains the Quadra 800's enclosure.

The 8100 originally featured a PowerPC 601 at 80 MHz, and was speed-bumped to 100 MHz in January 1995. The main variant of the 8100 are the 8100AV models, which came with an analog video in/out card in its Processor Direct Slot. A faster 110 MHz model was released in November 1994 without an AV variant.

The case has received criticism for being difficult to work with. Dan Knight, writing for Low End Mac, noted that "except for replacing the CPU card in the 8500, changing anything on the motherboard required completely removing it. That included removing the reset button, removing a screw, disconnecting several cables, then sliding the motherboard assembly forward about an inch, then pulling it away from its mounts."

In August 1995, the 8100 was discontinued, with the Power Macintosh 8500 taking its place.
