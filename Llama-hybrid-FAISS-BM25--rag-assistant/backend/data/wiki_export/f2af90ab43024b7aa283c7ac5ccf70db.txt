Career 
Crockett’s first experience of large scale touring was as a roadie for Love/Hate during their 1990 tour with AC/DC.

Then, through music manager Dennis Rider, Crockett was introduced to Whitfield Crane and Klaus Eichstadt. Childhood friends, Crane and Eichstadt had formed a band in Santa Barbara and following a number of early line-up changes Crockett joined in April 1991 on bass with Dave Fortman joining on guitar a year later. 

Ugly Kid Joe signed to Stardog/Mercury Records in 1991 and released As Ugly As They Wanna Be -notable for being the first EP to receive RIAA multi-platinum status.

Achieving commercial success with the hit single Everything About You which then featured in the film Wayne's World the band returned to the studio to record America's Least Wanted.

During the hiatus, Crockett played with Atomship, Love/Hate, Budderside, Abercrombie, Jon E. Love & The Haters, Hear Kitty Kitty and briefly with Steven Adler in his band Road Crew.
