He became one of the most representative players for Chievo, and was one of the main protagonists of the very impressive 2005–06 season contributing 2 goals and 12 assists. One of the top assisters that season.

Fiorentina

He scored Fiorentina's first UEFA Cup goal against Groningen and scored crucial goals against Atalanta and Parma which allowed Fiorentina to surpass AC Milan for the final Champions League spot. In the 2008–09 season Semioli was widely believed to be on his way out because of the tactic change and the arrival of players such as Stevan Jovetic. However, after season ending injuries to Adrian Mutu and Mario Santana, Semioli found his way back onto the first team, and was a valuable asset to Gilardino, providing him with many crosses and being a terror on the wings.

Sampdoria
Following the arrival of Marco Marchionni to Fiorentina, in July 2009, for €4.5 million, it was confirmed that Semioli was transferred to Sampdoria as a four-year deal, for €4 million fee in August, rejoining his former coach at Chievo, Luigi Delneri. Franco scored his first goal 13 February with a header against his former team Fiorentina which gave Bluecerchiati the lead.

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup he was one of the four backup players for the 23-men main squad chosen by manager Marcello Lippi to step in for any possible injuries. However, he was not called up to the final 23-man squad and thus never received a winners medal. On 16 August 2006, Semioli made his Italy national team senior debut in a 2–0 friendly defeat against Croatia, in Livorno, under Roberto Donadoni.

Semioli was recalled to the Italy squad for the final Euro 2008 qualifier with Scotland. In total he made 3 appearances for Italy between 2006 and 2007.
