David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport  is a public-use airport located near the city of Tomball in unincorporated Harris County, Texas. It is  northwest of the central business district of Houston. It is the busiest general aviation airport in Texas and one of the busiest general aviation airports in the United States. The airport is privately owned by Jag Gill.

The airport is notable because it is one of only a few privately owned airports with a Federal Aviation Administration control tower; the airport is owned by Jag Gill and managed by Roger Schmidt.

On June 27, 2007, The Texas State Legislature approved Tomball's request to annex Hooks Airport even though the airport does not border the Tomball city limits. Since the airport is in the city of Houston's extraterritorial jurisdiction, the city of Tomball must get permission from Houston to annex the airport. As of summer of 2010, the annex still has not been finalized.

History

The Airport started when Charles Hooks built a runway for his own personal use.  His hobby eventually became a business, and he subsequently built a runway and a main terminal building. It was first opened for public use in the 1960s.
Shortly after its opening, Hooks' son, David, was killed in the crash of a small plane that he was piloting under the supervision of a flight instructor. All four people on the plane were killed. David was 15 years old at the time of his death. The airport's name was changed from Houston Northwest Airport to David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport in his memory.

Until the 1980s, the airport was run and maintained by Hooks, and his wife Irma. Upon the death of Mrs. Hooks, her daughter stepped in and helped with its operation.

In 1989, Charles Hooks retired and sold the airport to the Gill Family.

In 2009 a fire occurred at the airport. A man was burned, and several aircraft were destroyed.

On June 26, 2010, another fire occurred at the airport, destroying another large hangar. One helicopter and several aircraft components were destroyed.

In early 2010, Hooks Airport received a notable resident when the B-17G Flying Fortress 'Texas Raiders' was permanently moved from William P. Hobby Airport to a spacious hangar in the Tomball Jet Center as a cost-saving measure. 'Texas Raiders' used Hooks Airport as her base of operations for the 2010 air show season and several years afterward.  The heavy bomber relocated again in March 2017 to General Aviation Services at Conroe North Houston Regional Airport in Conroe, Texas.  The B-17 has a Wikipedia page of its own if you desire more in-depth information.
