Biography
Hollywood Fats was born in Los Angeles and started playing guitar at the age of 10. While in his teens, his mother would drive him to various clubs in South Central Los Angeles to jam with well-known blues musicians when they came to town. Hollywood Fats' father was a doctor and his siblings went on to become doctors and lawyers.  He met Buddy Guy and Junior Wells who gave him the nickname. Hollywood Fats toured with James Harman, Jimmy Witherspoon, J. B. Hutto, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and Albert King.

During the 1970s and 1980s, he worked with the blues harmonica player and singer James Harman. He played on a number of his records including Thank You Baby; Those Dangerous Gentlemans; Extra Napkins (Strictly the Blues); Mo' Na' Kins, Please! (Strictly the Blues, Vol. 2); and Strictly Live In '85 (Vol. 1). Other guitarists with whom he played included Junior Watson, Kid Ramos, and Dave Alvin.

Hollywood Fats was invited to be a sideman to Muddy Waters and later met the harmonica player Al Blake. Blake had just moved to Los Angeles from Oklahoma. In 1974, Fats, Blake and pianist Fred Kaplan, who garnered drummer Richard Innes and bassist Jerry Smith from Rod Piazza's Bacon Fat band who had recorded with George "Harmonica" Smith on the Blue Horizon label.

The band consisted of Marshall Rohner of T.S.O.L. as well as Kevan Hill, Butch Azevedo, and Steven Ameche, all of The Twisters.

The first of the recordings came out on Al Blake's solo album Dr. Blake's Magic Soul Elixir released in 2002. This new version of the band started calling themselves the "Hollywood Blue Flames". They have released three albums under their new name for Delta Groove Productions. Their first album in 2005 was called Soul Sanctuary.
