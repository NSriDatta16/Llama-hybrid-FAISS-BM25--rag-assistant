Age of Reptiles is an album by the band Showbread. It was released on August 1, 2006.  It sold over 4,000 copies in its first week making it the first, and so far only, Showbread album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at position #198. The album was recorded in Weed, California at RadioStar Studios with producer Sylvia Massy and engineer Rich Veltrop.

Reaction of Fans
Upon its release, the album ignited a controversy among fans of Showbread's previous record, "No Sir, Nihilism Is Not Practical." The songs containing less of a "spastic" sound and less screaming vocals left fans of the hardcore music genre disappointed. Other Showbread fans maintain that it is their best work to date. On August 8, 2006, the band responded with a statement on their official website. Oh! Emetophobia! was first performed at the Underground Cafe in Roseville, California sometime in March 2006.

Production Mistakes

On the lyrics section, the lyrics to "George Romero Will Be At Our Wedding" are printed twice.

On the track listing, 'The Jesus Lizard' and 'Centipede Sisters' are switched in order.

On iTunes, many of the tracks are mislabeledâ€”the titles for "Oh! Emetophobia!" and "Sing Me To Sleep" are switched, track 7 is incorrectly labeled as "Mouth Like A Magazine" (a song from the band's previous album), and the tracks after track 7 are mislabeled as "The Jesus Lizard", "Centipede Sisters", and "Dinosaur Bones."
