Goat Haunt is a region of Glacier National Park in Montana, United States. Goat Haunt is located at the head of Waterton lake which is fed by the Waterton River. The headwaters for the Waterton River are located South of Goat Haunt Ranger Station at unnamed lakes located slightly higher than Nashukin Lake. The Goat Haunt area shares Waterton Lake with Waterton Lakes National Park in Canada.  This area is important for reinforcing the international nature of the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park.  It also provides hiking trails that connect the United States and Canada.  The region provides wildlife habitats on both sides of the border.  As a largely unspoiled natural area, visitors experience an area with few facilities or amenities, but with historical importance including Waterton Townsite and mountain passes used by American Indians.

Goat Haunt Ranger Station includes an International Peace Park Pavilion which showcases the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park agreement. The Pavilion is located right off the main dock at the ranger station. This dock is where "The International" a tourist vessel that sails from Waterton Townsite to Goat Haunt Ranger station multiple times per day during the summer season. The Goathaunt Bunkhouse is a historic structure located near the boat dock. Goat Haunt Ranger station also has a smaller dock where private vessels, US Border Patrol's boat and NPS boats can dock when needed. The border crossing at Goat Haunt is no longer staffed by US Customs personnel and all travelers (boat and hiking) are required to check in before arriving in Goat Haunt by using CBP ROAM or calling the port of Piegan 406-732-5982 x 201.  Visitors to this area must have carry proof of ROAM trip approval before being allowed further entry beyond the Goat Haunt area.
