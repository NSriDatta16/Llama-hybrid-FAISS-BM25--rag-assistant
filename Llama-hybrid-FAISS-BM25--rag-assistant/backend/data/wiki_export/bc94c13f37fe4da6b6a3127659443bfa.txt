The South Korean National Computerization Agency (NCA) () is a statutory government agency acting as Korea's top IT policy and technical support agency.

Overview 
The agency was founded by Article 10 of the Framework Act on Information Promotion for the purpose of promoting computerization and to support development of related policies for Korean national agencies and local governments.

NCA was able to launch an e-Government project to enhance public convenience and improve administrative efficiency.

The name was changed to the National Information Society Agency (NIA) in December 2020, and before that, it was known as the Korea Information Society Development Institute. The title of this article, "National Computerization Agency," was used only until 2006.

It is being prepared for the launch of a Digital Platform Government project similar to the e-Government project implemented by the former National Computerization Agency  in the past. It aims to move away from the previous method where each government agency provided services separately, and to create a single platform that enables access to all government data, with the goal of enhancing convenience for the public.
