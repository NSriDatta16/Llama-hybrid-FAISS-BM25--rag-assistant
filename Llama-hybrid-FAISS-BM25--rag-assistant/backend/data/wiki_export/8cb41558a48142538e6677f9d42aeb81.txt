History
Gan Yavne was established in 1931 by the "Achuza Aleph" Company founded by several Jewish families from Russia and Poland, who had immigrated to the United States. The inspiration for its name "Gan Yavne", comes from its proximity to the historical city of Yavne. In 1930 land was purchased and plans were drawn up to plant 400 dunams of orange groves. After negotiations with the Mandatory government between 1936 and 1938, a road was paved to Gan Yavne. The village was designed as a garden city.

As of 2017, the town has over 23,000 residents, who are almost exclusively Jewish.

In the 1990s and 2000s Gan Yavne more than doubled its population, becoming a commuter town. The development of Highway 4, which is a freeway between Tel Aviv and Gan Yavne junction, and also the introduction of frequent rail service to the nearby Ashdod railway station, allows commuters to travel to Tel Aviv in 30–45 minutes.
