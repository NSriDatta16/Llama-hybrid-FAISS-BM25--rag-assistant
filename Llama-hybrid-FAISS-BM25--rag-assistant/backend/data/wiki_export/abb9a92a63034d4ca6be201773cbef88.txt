Westfest is a free arts festival in Ottawa, Ontario, taking place the second weekend of June, at Tom Brown Arena and Park, in the Hintonburg area of Ottawa. The festival brings in over 300 artists, 150 volunteers and 40 staff over the weekend and features only Canadian talent. Westfest has been dedicated to bringing into the spotlight up and coming Canadian talent, while also featuring some of the best known names in the scene. The festival was founded in 2003 by Elaina Martin.
The range of artistic disciplines includes music, contemporary dance, visual art, media art, performance art, spoken word, poetry and fiction readings, Aboriginal art forms, and children's entertainment.

History 
The festival's first year, 2004, saw Jane Siberry as its first headliner, and set the tone for the future of the annual celebration.

One year later, in 2005, Westfest became a two-day festival. In 2006, Westfest was incorporated as a national not for profit organization and by 2007, became a three-day festival with extensive programming. In 2008, Westfest celebrated its fifth anniversary with a five-day event and more than 100 hours of programming, drawing in record breaking crowds, exceeding 100,000 people, to the festival's grounds.

Westfest took place in 2011 on June 10, 11, and 12 and featured performances by Lucie Idlout, Bif Naked, and the Mighty Popo. In 2011, the Westfest main stage was positioned behind the Real Canadian Superstore parking lot, a strategy that would quadruple the space create a fully licensed audience area.

In 2012, Westfest took place June 8, 9, and 10 with headliners such as Steven Page, The Cooper Brothers, and the Hidden Cameras as well as family activities.

Westfest's programming is 100% Canadian and 100% accessible, and since the beginning, admission to Westfest has been free to anyone wishing to attend. Westfest is also 100% inclusive and participating artists have come from all over Canada; from every province and territory, including Nunavut.
