The Very Best of... Sting & The Police is a compilation album issued by A&M Records on 17 November 1997, containing a mix of Police songs and Sting's solo works. It originally featured one new track, a remix of the 1978 song "Roxanne" by rap artist Sean "Puffy" Combs. The album was reissued in 1998 by PolyGram International with "Russians" removed and three added tracks: "Seven Days", "Fragile", and "De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da".

In 2002, an updated edition was released by Universal with several track changes: the songs "Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot", "Russians", and "Roxanne '97 (Puff Daddy Remix)" are omitted, with the songs "Brand New Day", "Desert Rose", and "So Lonely" in their place. "Brand New Day" and "Desert Rose" were recorded after the original 1997 Very Best Of, being from the 1999 album Brand New Day.
