USV Eschen/Mauren is a Liechtensteiner football club from Eschen and Mauren.

They play at the Sportpark Eschen-Mauren, which used to be the national football stadium, until the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz was built. USV Eschen/Mauren, like all other Liechtensteiner teams, play in the Swiss Football League system.  The first team plays in 1. Liga, Group 3, the fourth tier of the Swiss Football League, following promotion in the 2007/08 season from 2.Liga interregional as a result of winning the Group 5 division.

The club was originally formed in 1963 as a merger of FC Mauren and FC Eschen. Since 1975, the first team has always played in Liga 2 except for the 1999/2000 season when they were promoted to 1.
