Peawanuck is an isolated Cree community in the Kenora District, Ontario, Canada. It is located near the confluence of the Winisk and Shamattawa rivers, about 35Â km from the Winisk River's end in Hudson Bay. Its population is 237.

Its population used to live in the community of Winisk (), near the mouth of the Winisk River. This also used to be a Mid-Canada Line Radar site. In 1986, its population was forced to abandon Winisk as a result of the Winisk Flood Disaster. The community was relocated thirty kilometers up-river on higher ground. The new settlement was renamed Peawanuck, meaning "flintstone" in the Cree language. It only took seven months for the community to be rebuilt in Peawanuck, with much credit going to the community members who were determined to have their new homes ready by the winter. It is surrounded by lands of the Polar Bear Provincial Park providing Peawanuck with limited tourism opportunities. It lies at similar latitudes to Ketchikan, Prince Rupert, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Moscow but has much harsher winters than those other cities.
