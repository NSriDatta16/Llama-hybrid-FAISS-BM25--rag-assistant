Puhoi is a settlement located approximately 50 km north of Auckland, New Zealand on the banks of the Puhoi River. The name Puhoi is translated as "slow water". (Compare the Māori word , meaning "be slow, sluggish, unhurried.")

History
European settlement began on 29 June 1863 by a group of German-speaking migrants from Staab (modern Stod) in Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, under the leadership of Captain Martin Krippner. This has given it the appellation of "Bohemian Settlement". Altogether three batches of migrants arrived between 1863 and 1866.

The migrants were allocated parcels of land by the colonial government. However, when the migrants arrived, the land was covered with forest, which they had to set about clearing before they could begin to use the land.

The original settlers were all of the Roman Catholic faith and one of the first things they turned their attention to was constructing a church. This was completed in 1881 and dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul whose feast day in the Catholic calendar falls on 29 June, the date of the arrival of the first settlers. The church still stands today and serves the community. The hotel and general store also have their origins from the times of the first settlers. There is a museum which occupies premises that were originally built as the Catholic primary school (1923–1964).

The Puhoi Hotel is a historical building in the area, first receiving a liquor license in 1879, when it was known as the German Hotel.

Amenities

The Puhoi Town Library, one of the smallest in New Zealand, was established in 1923 in what was originally the Districts Road Board Office (built 1913). In the "Great Flood" of 1924 it was filled with 6 ft of silt, and its contents destroyed – the water level is marked on the building. The library was not re-established until 1977. It was flooded again in 2001. It contains over 4000 books and 500 DVDs and is staffed by a single volunteer librarian.

The Puhoi Pioneers Memorial Park Domain is found to the north of the village, across the Puhoi River. The park features a walking track, which climbs a ridge to a lookout, offering views of the village below.
