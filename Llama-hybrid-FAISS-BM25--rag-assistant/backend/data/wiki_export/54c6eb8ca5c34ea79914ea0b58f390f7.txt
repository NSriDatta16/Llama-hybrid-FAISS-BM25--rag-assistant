Constable of Portugal () was an office created by King Ferdinand I of Portugal in 1382, to substitute the High Standard-bearer (Alferes-Mor) as the head of the Portuguese Military. It was also referred as the Constable of the Kingdom (Condestável do Reino).

The Constable was the second most powerful person in the Kingdom, after the King of Portugal. The Constable's responsibility was to command the military in the absence of the King and to maintain discipline in the army; he was present at all military tribunals.

After the reign of John IV of Portugal (1640—1656), the title ceased to have military or administrative responsibilities, becoming an honorific title.
