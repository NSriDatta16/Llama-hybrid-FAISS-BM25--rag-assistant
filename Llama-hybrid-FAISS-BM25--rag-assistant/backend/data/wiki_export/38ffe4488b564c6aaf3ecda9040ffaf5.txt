Taunus/Cologne pattern
Named for the 1962 Ford Taunus V4 engine and Ford Cologne V6 engine built in Cologne, Germany.
 1.2/1.3/1.5/1.7L were mostly in European Cars.
 1.8, 2.0/2.3 had the same bellhousings bolt patterns with differences from year to year to be wary of. The Mazda transmission 5M** does not "directly replace" the Mitsubishi transmissions as there are shifter spacing differences in the floorboard. The Mitsubishi transmission was made to fit Mustang IIs and was shoehorned into the early Rangers. Later models came with hydraulic clutches. These were commonly found in Pintos, some Mustang II/Capris, and Rangers but do not match the V6 Bell housings. Changing the engine to a V6 often requires changing the bellhousing (Mitsubishi) but the Mazda trans had an integral bell.
 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, and 2.9 Cosworth. Most of these were RWD car engines. Some had the same Mitsubishi manual transmission as the 2.0/2.3 but had different bellhousings. The 2.3, 2.8, and 2.9 also made it into the Ranger, and Bronco II.
 4.0L was produced by Ford Cologne Germany (like the unrelated and the all-new metric Taurus/Sable FWD 3.0 V6). Both were put in the North American Ranger, Aerostar, Explorer platforms. The 4.0L bellhousing and the 3.0L bellhousings "MAY" interchange, but they do not interchange with the previous Cologne engines.

 1.6L/2.0L EAO
 1.3/1.6/1.8/2.0/2.3/2.5L OHC I4 RWD. This engine was also produced in Cologne, Germany. It was put in Pintos, Mustangs, Fairmonts and Rangers.  It was then modified by Mazda to become the 2.5L in the late 1990s Ranger/U.S. sold Mazda pickups. Ford modified this design further so it is hardly recognizable from pre-2000 (date uncertain) year models. Caution!
 1.8/2.0 Zetec-E/Zeta Engine Zeta (Later blocks had the starter relocated to one of the bellhousing bolt locations and only partially match.)
