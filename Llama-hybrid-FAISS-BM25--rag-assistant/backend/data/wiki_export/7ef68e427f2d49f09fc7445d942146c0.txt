Sinajana () is the smallest of the nineteen villages in the United States territory of Guam by area.  It is located in the hills south of Hagåtña (formerly Agana).  The village's name may have come from the word "china-jan," cookware used to cook wild yams that once grew in the area.

Urban renewal
Sinajana is one of a few villages that was urbanized as a result of a federal urban renewal program. Afami, Agana Springs, and Didigue are a few non-urbanized areas within this same village. There are over 75 homes in Afami, most of which are built below a high cliff, with a few homes high atop a ridge overlooking Hagatna and Mong-Mong. Agana Springs is located below the cliff line of Sinajana and contains a natural spring with small living creatures like frogs and turtles. Didigue is located at the other end of Agana Springs and is accessible by taking a steep single lane road through Afame. Although called Didigue, it is named Spring Lane.
