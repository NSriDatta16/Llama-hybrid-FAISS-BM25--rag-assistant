History 

The Inverness and Ross-shire Railway (I&RR), which was to be a line between  and , was authorised in 1860, and opened in stages. By the time that the last section, that between  and Invergordon, opened on 25 March 1863, the I&RR had amalgamated with the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway (I&AJR), the authorisation being given on 30 June 1862. On this last stretch, one of the original stations was that at Alness. The I&AJR in turn amalgamated with other railways to form the Highland Railway in 1865, which became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The station at Alness was then closed by the British Transport Commission on 13 June 1960 and remained so for 13 years.
 
The station reopened on 7 May 1973 after significant housing development in the area. The initial service provision was three trains each way on weekdays and one on Sundays.

Accidents and incidents 
A person died at the station in March 2023 after being struck by a train. The line was reopened the next day. A man was also struck by a train 16 years earlier, in September 2006.

Facilities 
The station consists of one platform on the northern side of the railway, with only a small shelter available. The station also has a small car park, bike racks and a bench. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Services 

On weekdays and Saturdays, there are 7 trains northbound (4 to Wick via Thurso, 1 to Invergordon, 1 to Ardgay and 1 to Tain) and 8 trains southbound to Inverness. On Sundays, there are five trains southbound to Inverness, and 5 trains northbound (3 to Tain, 1 to Invergordon and 1 through to Wick.
