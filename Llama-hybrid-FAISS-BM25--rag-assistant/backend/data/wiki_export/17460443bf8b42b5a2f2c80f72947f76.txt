In his Senate run, Salvi defeated Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra in the Republican primary, but was defeated by U.S. Representative Dick Durbin in the general election.

In 1998, Salvi ran for Illinois Secretary of State. Though he defeated State Representative Robert W. Churchill in the Republican primary, he lost in the general election to Democrat Jesse White.
