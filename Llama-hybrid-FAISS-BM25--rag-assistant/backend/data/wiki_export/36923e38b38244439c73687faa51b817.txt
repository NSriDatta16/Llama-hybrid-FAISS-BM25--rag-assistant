The following is a list of operators of the LTV A-7 Corsair II attack aircraft.

Operators

Greece

The Hellenic Air Force acquired 60 A-7Hs and five TA-7Hs from LTV between 1975-1980 and then 50 A-7Es and 18 TA-7Cs from the US Navy's inventory in 1993–1994.

Greece operated the Corsair IIs, in the form of the A-7E and TA-7C variants, and used these aircraft in the traditional tactical strike and ground attack roles for which it was designed. Greek A-7s were upgraded with many improvements, such as greater thrust from their Allison TF-41 engines, upgraded avionics, radar, and full day/night capabilities. All Greek A-7s were programmed to be retired on October 17, 2014.

Portugal

Portugal's A-7s (designated A-7P, TA-7P) were 20 converted ex-United States Navy (USN) A-7A airframes powered by the Pratt & Whitney TF30-P408 engine and were equipped with A-7D and A-7E avionics. These aircraft were purchased through the V-519 contract of May 5, 1980, and initially 28 A-7A airframes were to be converted to the A-7P standard, but only the best 20 airframes were approved for the conversion. Deliveries to Portugal against this contract began on December 24, 1981, with the arrival of the first nine aircraft, and were completed by September 29, 1982.

In May, 1983, Portugal renegotiated the contract and placed an order for an additional 24 A-7Ps and six A-7As converted to two-seaters as TA-7P standard. Delivery of the aircraft of this second order took place between October 8, 1984, and April 30, 1986. However, one A-7P (PoAF s/n 15540) of the 24 ordered was lost in an accident in the United States prior to its delivery.

As part of the second order, the United States Navy leased one TA-7C (s/n 154404; c/n B-044) to Portugal between April 1982 and June 1985 for operational conversion of fighter pilots. This aircraft, a A-7B-1-CV Corsair II converted to TA-7C tandem-seat trainer, was nicknamed "Pomba Branca" (white dove) due to the original USN white paint that was kept. It was later returned to the United States Navy.

On June 10, 1999, the last operational Corsair II conducted the last flight of the aircraft fleet in service with the PoAF, with 64,000 logged flight hours.

Thailand

Thailand purchased 14 A-7Es and 4 TA-7Cs for coastal defense and sea patrol duties. The aircraft were delivered during the summer of 1995 and were in service with the 104th "White Shark" squadron, 1st Wing at U-Tapao Air Base. These aircraft were not operational as of July 20, 2007. However, the Royal Thai Navy continues to maintain the operability of the aircraft with the necessary maintenance and by starting them up and taxiing them on the airport's tarmac.

United States

United States Air Force
In response to the Army's need for a ground attack aircraft in South Vietnam, the Vought A-7 seemed to be a relatively quick and inexpensive way to satisfy this need. The USAF version of the aircraft was designated A-7D, and was customized with a different engine, a new avionics package, and an M61 rotary cannon, and a computerized navigation/weapons delivery system.

Support Commands

The first YA-7D and some early production A-7D aircraft were received from LTV by Air Force Systems Command at Edwards AFB, California (Tail code: ED) and Eglin AFB, Florida (EG) in early 1968. Edwards aircraft were used for the initial Flight Testing (FT) of the new aircraft, and were later retained for ongoing flight testing of aircraft modifications over its years in operational service.  An A-7D was also used at the USAF Test Pilot School.  In 1979, the prototype A-7K two-seat trainer was tested at Edwards, and in 1988, the YA-7F Strike fighter was also tested there.  Edlin Aircraft were used for Operational Testing (OT) and weapons tests of ordnance.

Tinker AFB, Oklahoma (FLZ) was designated the prime depot support facility for the A-7D.  All newly manufactured aircraft were delivered there from LTV for acceptance inspection by Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC) prior to delivery to operational units.  Tinker also provided ongoing depot-level maintenance and IRAN inspections of operational aircraft until its retirement in 1992.

A-7D Corsair II aircraft arrived at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in October 1972 during the Vietnam War. The aircraft were deployed primarily from the 353d and 356th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF)  activated the 3d Tactical Fighter Squadron/388th TFW at Korat and most of the Myrtle Beach A-7Ds were transferred to the new permanent squadron. 3d TFS aircraft were tail-coded "JH". This was the only A-7D unit assigned outside of the United States on a permanent basis.

Although assigned to Nellis AFB, the aircraft operated from Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada (LV) as part of the F-117A Stealth Fighter program. In 1989, the aircraft were transferred to the Air National Guard when the F-117A became operational.

Note:*** Prior to June 1972, Squadron Tail Codes were used on Myrtle Beach and Davis-Monthan aircraft.  These were standardized to MB for 354th TFW and DM for 355th TFW IAW AFM 66–1 in June 1972.

United States Air National Guard
With the end of the Vietnam War, Air National Guard (ANG) units began receiving active-duty A-7D aircraft in 1974, beginning with the Colorado, New Mexico and Ohio ANG. South Carolina and Puerto Rico received aircraft in 1975.  New production aircraft (1974, 1975 serial numbers) began to be received by ANG units in 1975.   
As Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft were received by Tactical Air Command, additional A-7Ds were transferred to Iowa and South Dakota in 1977, along with Arizona and Michigan in 1978. The last Air National Guard squadrons equipped were units of the Pennsylvania ANG in 1980; and of the Oklahoma and Virginia ANGs in 1981. 

The A-7K Corsair II was a two-seat trainer version of the A-7D for Air National Guard, The aircraft was a fully combat capable A-7D but with two seats in tandem. The first A-7Ks were delivered in 1982.

In the early 1990s, the A-7D was phased out of the ANG inventory, with the aircraft being sent to AMARC. In 1993 the last units to retire the A-7D were the ANG units at Rickenbacker ANGB (Ohio) in January, Des Moines (Iowa) in September, with the last unit being the 125th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Tulsa (Oklahoma) in October 1993.

United States Navy
The A-7 Corsair II made its initial military service and combat debut with the United States Navy in 1967 and, over time, became its most prolific user. It was gradually phased out in the 1980s with the introduction of its replacement, the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. Eventually the US Navy retired its last Corsair IIs in May 1991.
