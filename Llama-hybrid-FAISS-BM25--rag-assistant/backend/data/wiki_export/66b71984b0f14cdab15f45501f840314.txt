Philip Krumm (born April 7, 1941 in Baltimore, Maryland) is an American composer who was "a pioneer of modal, repetitive pattern music". Krumm studied orchestration and composition with Raymond Moses in high school, with Frank Sturchio at Saint Mary's University, with Ross Lee Finney at University of Michigan, and with Karlheinz Stockhausen at the University of California at Davis.

In 1960, as a high school student, Krumm began producing an early concert series of major modern works by John Cage, Richard Maxfield, Philip Corner, La Monte Young, Terry Riley, himself and others at McNay Art Institute, San Antonio. He recruited "Blue" Gene Tyranny, also in high school at the time, to perform in this series. Krumm then moved to Ann Arbor, MI where he was a performer and composer in the ONCE Festival in 1962–64. While touring with the ONCE Group, he participated in a Carnegie Hall performance with Yoko Ono, George Brecht, and Terry Jennings. In 1963 he met Jerry Hunt while performing at Roger Shattuck's 'Pataphysics Festival in Austin, Texas, and the two composers toured together and collaborated on several projects.
