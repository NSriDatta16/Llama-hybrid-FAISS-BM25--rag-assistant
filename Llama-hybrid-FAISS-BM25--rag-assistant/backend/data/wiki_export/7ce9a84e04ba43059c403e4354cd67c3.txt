Malubiting (), also known as Malubiting West, ranks as the second highest 
peak within the Haramosh Group of Mountains, which is a subrange located within the Karakoram  range in Pakistan. It is situated within the Haramosh valley, between Bilchar Dobani  and Haramosh Peak, in the Gilgit-Baltistan region..

Location 
Malubiting is situated at the core of the Haramosh Group of Mountains, which tower over the northern bank of the Indus River. It is located approximately 50 km to the east of Gilgit, the principal town in the area. To the southwest, Malubiting ascends sharply above the Haramosh Jutial village along the banks of the Phuparash River, and to the east, the extensive Chogo Lungma Glacier originates from its slopes.

Climbing history 
Malubiting was unsuccessfully attempted in 1955, 1959, 1968, 1969 and 1970 and 1971 before the first ascent in 1971. In that year an Austrian team led by Horst Schindlbacher reached the summit via the Northeast Ridge, ascending the North Peak and skirting the Central Peak on the way.

According to the Himalayan Index, there has been only one additional ascent, by a Swiss-German team in 1997, via the original route. (There may, however, have been other ascents that did not make it into the Index.)
