Bridge of Orchy railway station is a railway station in the village of Bridge of Orchy in the west of Scotland. The station is on the West Highland Line, between Rannoch and Upper Tyndrum,  from Craigendoran Junction, near Helensburgh. ScotRail manage the station and operate most services, with others provided by Caledonian Sleeper.

History 

This station opened by the West Highland Railway on 7 August 1894.

The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1935 to 1939 and possibly one for some of 1934.

Facilities 

The island platform is only equipped with shelters and bike racks, although there is a car park. The only access to the station is via a stepped subway, so there is no step-free access. As there are no facilities to purchase tickets, passengers must buy one in advance, or from the guard on the train.

Passenger volume 

The statistics cover twelve month periods that start in April.

Services 
Monday to Saturday, Bridge of Orchy has three ScotRail services to Mallaig and three services to Glasgow Queen Street. Caledonian Sleeper operate one service each day, each way to Fort William and London Euston (except Saturday nights). On Sundays, there are two services northbound to Mallaig and two southbound to Glasgow Queen Street, as well as the Caledonian Sleeper to London Euston. This can also be used by regular travellers to and from stations towards Edinburgh, as it is booked to set down at some stations and carries seating coaches as far as Edinburgh.
