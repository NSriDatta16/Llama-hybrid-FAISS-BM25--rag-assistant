History 
The formation date of the Presidential Security Force (Paspampres) is based on the operation to evacuate President Sukarno, Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Prime Minister Sutan Syahrir as well as several ministers and high-ranking government officials from Jakarta to Yogyakarta on 3 January 1946, This operation was based on the safety concerns of the President and VIPs about the allied forces intimidation in Jakarta. The rescue operation was conducted using the  a code-name for the special Presidential train. This date is commemorated as  or Paspampres Service Day.

The formation of a formal force dedicated to protecting the Indonesian president only came after several assassination attempts on President Sukarno. On 6 June 1962 a special regiment known as the Tjakrabirawa Regiment, was formed to protect the president and his family. June 6 was also the birthday of President Sukarno.  consisted of personnel from the army, navy, air force and police. In 1966, it was dissolved due its taking part in an army-led abortive coup d'état in 1965. The 1st Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Untung Syamsuri, led the coup attempt and its members carried out the kidnappings of army generals who were later murdered. The protection of the president was then entrusted to a Army Military Police Task Force (Satgas POMAD) in 1966.

A new presidential protection force named  (an abbreviation of  or "Presidential Escort Force") was formed on the 13 January 1976, under the command of the Minister of Defence and Commander of the Armed Forces. This force was renamed in 1988 becoming the current Paspampres. Today, Paspampres has strength of about 2,500 personnel and is headed by a two-star general/admiral/marshal from the TNI.
