"The Other Side" is a single released on Paul van Dyk's second DJ mix album The Politics of Dancing 2. Paul van Dyk wrote the song in retort to the devastating tsunami which hit southeast Asia on 26 December 2004. Van Dyk believes it is important to recognise that many thousands of people were affected by this tragedy, and lost loved ones. "The Other Side" portrays the feeling of still being with a person, in one's thoughts, who has died. It expresses the faith and aspiration of seeing that person again on "the other side".

The single also includes remixes by Deep Dish, Mark Spoon and Martin Roth. It features Wayne Jackson on vocals, formerly of the band the Dostoyevskys, and was also featured on Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA's home version songlist.

Music video
The video features a poor elderly man going through a day in his life, with two ever-present people (invisible to him, possibly representing guardian angels, and played by Wayne and van Dyk) observing and occasionally influencing his life. The man goes out to beg with his dog, who finds a lottery ticket - and the man knows it's a winning ticket because he read the newspaper used to wrap food given to the dog by one of the guardian angels.
