King Prawn are an English ska punk band founded in 1993. The band split in 2003, later reforming for a second run in 2012.

History
The band's formation was in London, 1993. The first major recording was First Offence three years later, produced by Martin "Ace" Kent of Skunk Anansie.

King Prawn toured regularly with a broad range of bands, varying from hardcore to traditional and 2 Tone ska bands.

The band called time on their first incarnation in 2003.

Hiatus 
After the band split, Babar Luck, the bass player, started to perform under his own name. In 2006, he release the album Care in the Community, and has since released several solo and collaborative recordings. 

In the summer of 2007, Al Rumjen joined Asian Dub Foundation as their new vocalist. His first performance as a member of Asian Dub Foundation was at The Womad Festival in Singapore and his first album with the band was Punkara.

Reformation 
In 2012, the band reformed and played festivals and a club tour. They featured an extended brass section with a keys player, but without Babar Luck.

In 2013, the band played at Boomtown Festival and Reading & Leeds Festivals and completed a UK tour in November 2013.

The band released two tracks on the Bandcamp platform in 2014.

A fifth LP was released in April 2019 called The Fabulous new sounds of ... on Cherry Red Records.

In 2020, the band released two singles and started work on their sixth album.

Awards 
They were nominated for a Kerrang! award in 1998 for Best New British Band, and in 2000 for Spirit of Independence.

Style
King Prawn blend elements of punk, hardcore, metal, ska, dub, reggae, and hip hop into their music, which they dub "wildstyle". In 2016, Jones stated that The Dead Kennedys, Crass, Public Enemy, Rage Against the Machine, and Bob Marley all influenced the band.
