History

Mai FM began broadcasting to Auckland in July 1992. It was run by one of the largest Maori tribes in New Zealand, Ngāti Whātua, and Mai Media. Between 1996 and 2005 Mai FM also operated a second station, Ruia Mai, on 1179 AM in Auckland with all programming in the Māori language.

From 1996 to 2001 Mai FM could be heard in Christchurch on 90.5 FM, due to an agreement between Ngāti Whātua and Kāi Tahu iwi. The Christchurch station was originally 90.5 Tahu FM, with local on air talent, and formatted with the Mai FM Auckland music. In late 2001 the joint agreement ended and the Mai FM branding of the station in Christchurch ceased, reverting to its original name of Tahu FM. In 1996 Ngati Whatua also came to an agreement with the Te Arawa iwi to broadcast Mai FM in Rotorua on 96.7 FM, over the years the frequency changed to 99.1 and is now broadcasting on 105.5.

On 29 February 2008 it was announced that MediaWorks New Zealand had bought the station and would take it over on 31 March 2008. Since the MediaWorks' takeover there has been significant programming and branding changes as well as the creation of the Mai FM network.
