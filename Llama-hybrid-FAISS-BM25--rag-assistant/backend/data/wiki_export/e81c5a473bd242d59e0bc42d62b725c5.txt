Service history
Ira Jeffery conducted shakedown training off Bermuda and in Casco Bay, Maine, before returning to Naval Torpedo Station, Quonset, Rhode Island, for experiments with noise-makers designed to counter the German acoustic torpedo.  She then moved to New York and departed on 5 November 1943 with her first Atlantic convoy.  During the next year, she sailed with seven Atlantic troop convoys, seeing each safely to staging points in Northern Ireland or Great Britain. After her return to Charleston on 22 October 1944, Ira Jeffery joined a large convoy of cranes, powerplants, and tugs bound for the invasion ports of Europe. On the return crossing, 20 December 1944, the escort's convoy was attacked by the U-boat .  After sinking an LST and damaging destroyer escort , the submarine was driven off. Ira Jeffery assisted the damaged ship and eventually escorted her through rough seas to the Azores.

Returning to the United States on 1 February 1945, the ship spent two weeks working with experimental mines in Chesapeake Bay. She entered the Marine Basin Shipyard, Brooklyn on 20 February for conversion to a Charles Lawrence-class high speed transport. After the installation of troop quarters and extensive alterations she emerged in May 1945 as APD-44 (officially reclassified on 23 February 1945) and departed on 12 May for shakedown in Chesapeake Bay. Ira Jeffery then sailed on 25 May with aircraft carrier  for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 18 June 1945.

After training in Hawaiian waters, the ship returned to San Diego on 23 July and began training with Underwater Demolition Teams.  She sailed on 16 August, the day after the war's end for the forward areas, stopping at Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Manila.  After demolition exercises in Lingayen Gulf, she sailed to Wakayama, Japan, where underwater demolition teams reconnoitered beaches prior to American occupation landings.  After the successful operation, Ira Jeffery sailed for the United States, arriving San Diego on 20 November 1945.

The ship sailed via the Panama Canal for the East Coast and, after her arrival Philadelphia on 8 December, underwent repairs. Ira Jeffery then sailed to Jacksonville, Florida, and decommissioned at Green Cove Springs on 18 June 1946. She entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and remained there until struck from the Navy List on 1 June 1960. She was sunk during tests in July 1962.
