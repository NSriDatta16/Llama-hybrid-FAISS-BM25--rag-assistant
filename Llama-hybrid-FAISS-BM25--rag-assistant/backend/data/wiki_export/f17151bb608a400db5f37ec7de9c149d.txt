Services

Mondays to Saturdays, the station is served by three Scotrail trains per day in each direction, northbound to  and southbound to , along with the Highland Caledonian Sleeper between London Euston and  via Edinburgh Waverley (the latter doesn't run southbound on Saturday nights or northbound on Sunday mornings, and only calls at the station on request). Sundays see just two trains per day call, as well as the southbound sleeper. The sleeper also carries seated coaches and can thus be used by regular passengers from/to Glasgow (Queen St Low Level) and Edinburgh.
