Confey GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club based in Leixlip, County Kildare, Ireland and won Kildare's Club of the Year award in 2004.

History
On 19 January 1989, a meeting was held in the home of Michael Divilly for those who were interested in creating a separate GAA club for the northern half of Leixlip in the parish of Confey. At this meeting it was agreed to hold a public meeting to gain further support for the foundation of a new club, which was subsequently held in the local school on 30 January. Following this meeting a formal approach was made to the Kildare County board, and Confey was formally registered as a club on 27 February 1989. The club's first official match came in March, with the men's football team losing to Cappagh on a scoreline of 2–3 to 2–2. The club acquired six and a half acres at Cope Bridge in 1990, followed by a further three and a half acres the following year. The club's first chairman was Pat Sweeney. In 1998 the club opened a new clubhouse, with a bar, sportshall, and several dressing rooms. The club's facilities at Cope Bridge are named Creaton Park in memory of Jimmy Creaton who was one of the founding members of the club and club chairman in 1990 and 1991.

Confey's first title at adult football level came in 1995 when the Confey under 21 footballers beat Maynooth to claim the 1995 Kildare Under 21 Football B Championship.
