Wallace William "Wally" Diestelmeyer (July 14, 1926 â€“ December 23, 1999) was a Canadian figure skater. He competed in pair skating with Suzanne Morrow.  The couple won the bronze medal at the 1948 Winter Olympics and the 1948 World Figure Skating Championships.  They are credited as being the first pair to perform the death spiral one-handed, with the man holding the woman in position with one hand, at the 1948 Olympic Games.

After retiring from competitions Distelmeyer worked as a skating coach. In 1992 he was inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame, together with Morrow.
