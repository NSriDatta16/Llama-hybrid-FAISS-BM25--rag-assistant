Siculiana is a town and comune in the province of Agrigento, Sicily, southern Italy,  west of the provincial capital Agrigento.

Geography 
Siculianaâ€™s  long coast line is largely unspoiled; a protected Regional Nature Reserve has been established in the locality of Torre Salsa for its natural beauty and environmental interest.

Siculiana Marina is a suburban seaside village of Siculiana on the Strait of Sicily. Once an important settlement for maritime trade in the Mediterranean, with a prominent commercial Marketplace emporium, it is now a popular summer resort. The Caricatore (Loading Dock) was still active up to the end of 19th century.

Monuments
The ruins of the once-embattled Castello Chiaramonte, near the coast, is a prominent feature of the landscape. Within the city, the Baroque church Santuario del Santissimo Crocifisso is a well-known landmark. Inside is revered the Black Crucifix, which was moved to the church in 1611 from the castle in which it was previously kept.
