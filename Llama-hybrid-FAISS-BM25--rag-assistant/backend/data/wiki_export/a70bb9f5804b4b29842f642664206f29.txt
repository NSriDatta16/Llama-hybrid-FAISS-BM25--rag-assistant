Laclede's Landing station is a St. Louis MetroLink station. It is located near Laclede's Landing and Gateway Arch National Park in Downtown St. Louis, Missouri. The National Park Service recommends visitors accessing the Arch via public transportation use this station or the 8th & Pine station.

Laclede's Landing is the easternmost station in Missouri, located on the lower deck of the Eads Bridge before crossing the Mississippi River into Illinois. The station sits at the east portal of the St. Louis Freight Tunnel, constructed in 1874 to carry trains between the Eads Bridge and the Mill Creek Valley rail yards, it saw its last train (Amtrak) in 1974. The tunnel was refurbished in 1991 in preparation for the opening of MetroLink, which uses the route to connect Illinois and Missouri via downtown St. Louis.

The station is known for its historic brickwork that frames the Gateway Arch from the platform level.
