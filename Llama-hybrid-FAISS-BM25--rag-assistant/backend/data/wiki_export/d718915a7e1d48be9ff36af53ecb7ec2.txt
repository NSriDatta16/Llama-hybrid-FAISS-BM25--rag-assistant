Ohio's 4th congressional district spans sections of the central part of the state. It is currently represented by Republican Jim Jordan, the current chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who has represented the district since 2007.

As part of the 2010 redistricting process, it was redrawn from the previous district to stretch from Lima, to include the northwestern suburbs of Columbus, up to Tiffin and Elyria on the shores of Lake Erie.

In May 2019, a panel of three federal judges ruled that Ohio's congressional district map was unconstitutional and based on gerrymandering.  A new map was expected ahead of the 2020 election. However, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rucho v. Common Cause that courts could not review allegations of gerrymandering, the district boundaries would not change until congressional district maps were redrawn in 2022.
