Rocky IV: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the original motion picture soundtrack to the movie of the same name. It was released on November 27, 1985 by Scotti Bros. Records.

The soundtrack was hugely successful on the strength of two top-five singles, Survivor's "Burning Heart" (personally commissioned for the film by Sylvester Stallone) reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100) and James Brown's "Living in America", as well as Robert Tepper's lone top-40 hit, "No Easy Way Out" which reached #22. It reached the top ten on the US Billboard 200 album chart and was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

It is the only score to a Rocky film not composed by Bill Conti, but does incorporate some music he composed for the first film.
