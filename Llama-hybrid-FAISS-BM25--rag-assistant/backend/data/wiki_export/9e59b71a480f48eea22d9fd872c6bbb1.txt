Route description

West of US 441
West of US 441, Yamato Road exists for approximately  without state or county designation. Its western terminus is a traffic circle with Coral Ridge Drive, providing access to the Saturnia retirement community and Sunrise Park Elementary School. This section of Yamato also provides access to Burt Aaronson South County Regional Park.

CR 794
CR 794 begins at an intersection between Yamato Road and US 441 / SR 7 in the former census-designated places of Whisper Walk and Hamptons at Boca Raton. It proceeds east, serving as the primary access road for the many gated communities and golf clubs in the area, and also passes over Florida's Turnpike. At an intersection with Jog Road (formerly SR 845), Yamato provides access to the Woodfield Plaza shopping center and Spanish River Community High School. CR 794 and Yamato continue east, intersecting with Saint Andrews Boulevard (a primary arterial road in Boca Raton) before transitioning to SR 794 at Military Trail.

SR 794
SR 794 begins at the intersection of Yamato Road and Military Trail (CR 809) in the country club neighborhoods of Boca Raton. The highway heads eastward as the eight-lane arterial boulevard. SR 794 continues through the country clubs, passing to the south of Broken Sound Golf Course and to the north of the local residential developments. The road then turns to the northwest, passing the Boca Raton Tri-Rail station.

After crossing a riverbank, SR 794 continues eastward as an eight-lane arterial, which crosses the Tri-Rail line before intersecting with a ramp to SR 800 (Spanish River Blvd), a road which is only directly accessible from Yamato Road through the eastbound direction. This ramp merges with a ramp originating from an Exit 48A on I-95, which takes drivers directly to SR 800. The road then immediately reaches an interchange with I-95. The highway continues eastward as a six-lane arterial into the interchange, crossing under the interstate and entering a densely populated part of Boca Raton. The road becomes surrounded by a mix of commercial and residential developments before crossing a local freight railroad and SR 811 (Dixie Highway). Continuing eastward, SR 794 goes for a short distance further into Boca Raton, ending at an intersection with US 1 (and unsigned SR 5).
