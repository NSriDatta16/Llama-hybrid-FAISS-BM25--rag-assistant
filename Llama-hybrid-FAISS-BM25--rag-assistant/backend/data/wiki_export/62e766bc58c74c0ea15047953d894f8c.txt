Bosco Chocolate Syrup is a brand of chocolate syrup first produced in 1928.  The company, Bosco Products, Inc., is based in  Towaco, New Jersey, and products are sold throughout the United States and Europe.

History
Bosco Chocolate syrup was purportedly invented in 1928 in Camden, New Jersey, by an unknown physician. The William S. Scull Company, founded in 1931 in Camden, acquired the manufacturing license. The Scull Company's most famous product was Boscul Coffee, which gave the product its brand name, "Bosco". In the 1950s, Corn Products Company acquired the brands Bosco, and Bosco Products, Inc. in 1985. The name recalls the Ancient Greek word βόσκω : bóskō, "I nourish."

The company has branched out and makes other products, including candy bars bearing the brand name.

Production process
Formerly, bulk materials were added via automatic measuring devices into stainless steel cooking vats.  Minor ingredients and flavorings were blended into the batch separately, through a custom blender device, adhering to stringent product handling standards.  While in the vats, Bosco was pasteurized for product uniformity and then cooled for bottling. Computers measured and monitored the product temperatures. Malt extract and vanilla was added and combined with cocoa powder, which yielded the distinctive Bosco taste.

As of 2020, Bosco no longer follows this process. The recipe now omits malt extract and vanilla, altering the flavor and viscosity of the product.

Bosco was once packaged in glass jars, but is now sold in plastic squeeze bottles.

As of 2015, Bosco is produced in several flavors in addition to the original chocolate: strawberry, sea salt caramel, fudge brownie, sugar free, and mocha (the last of which was added c. 2012, replacing berry blue).
