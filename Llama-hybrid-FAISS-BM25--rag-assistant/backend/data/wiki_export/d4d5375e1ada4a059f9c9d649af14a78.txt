History

In 2000, phase one of the TransMilenio system was opened between Portal de la 80 and Tercer Milenio, including this station.

The station is named Calle 22 due to its proximity to that street. It services the demand of the passengers of downtown Bogotá, specifically the neighborhoods of Santa Fé and Alameda.

Four months after the opening of the TransMilenio, during the national strike of April 9, 2001, the first attacks against the system occurred. The stations Calle 19 and Calle 22 were destroyed by stones, and some passengers suffered light wounds.
