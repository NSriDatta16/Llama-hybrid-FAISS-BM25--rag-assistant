Symphony for the Devil is a live DVD by Type O Negative released on March 14, 2006. It is a video of a live concert at the Bizarre Festival in 1999, with a behind-the-scenes look at Type O Negative, an interview with the band, commentary, biographies of the band members and a collection of photographs.

The DVD was recorded on Sunday August 22, 1999, at the 12th Bizarre Festival in Cologne, Germany. This gig was originally recorded for a German live-in-concert program, WDR Rockpalast, and broadcast on German television. The band bought the live footage because it seemed to be the best one available to date regardless of the previous TV releases. Twelve cameras were used. The DVD does not have the performances of the cover songs "Back in the USSR" and "Day Tripper Medley" that were part of the live show and TV broadcast.

A bonus CD of the Dead Again album has five audio tracks from this show.
