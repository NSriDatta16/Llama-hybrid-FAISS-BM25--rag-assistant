Plot
Ramón Ayala (better known as Daddy Yankee) stars as Edgar Dinero, a young man from the streets of Puerto Rico who gets tangled up in the thug life of his neighborhood. While on that path, Edgar encounters disruption among his crew men, while simultaneously falling in love with an uptown girl, Soribel (played by Katiria Soto), from whom Dinero must conceal his strong ties with the violent neighborhood underworld.

Dinero's first studio recording in New York City doesn't go well. It seems he has no energy and sounds like he hasn't eaten. When his love interest, the uptown girl, shows up in NYC, he begins to make strong recordings.

Multiple gunshot scenes happen throughout the movie, in Puerto Rico and in New York City.

The movie was mostly shot in the , a marginalized community, that reflects thug life in Caguas, Puerto Rico. Other places where filming took place were at Puerto Nuevo, in San Juan, and in New York City.

Musetto of New York Post said in his review for the film: "Reggaeton star Daddy Yankee holds his own in his big-screen acting debut, Talento de barrio. Too bad he's saddled with a generic script, based loosely on his own life". Monika Fabian of Time Out New York said: "Just as reggaetón is a fusion of hip-hop, reggae and traditional Puerto Rican rhythms, Talento de barrio is also a mixture, albeit a woefully derivative one, of 8 Mile, Menace II Society and Carlito's Way."
