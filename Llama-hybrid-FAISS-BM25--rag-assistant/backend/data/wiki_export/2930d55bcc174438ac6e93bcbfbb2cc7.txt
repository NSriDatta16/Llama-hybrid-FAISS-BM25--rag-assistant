Ebelle "Eugène" Ferdinand Ekéké  (born 30 May 1960) is a Cameroonian former professional footballer who played as a forward. He appeared for the Cameroon national team at the 1990 World Cup in Italy.  He famously scored to give Cameroon the lead against England in the quarter-finals, before eventually losing 3–2.

Born in Bonabéri, Cameroon, Ekéké played most of his club football in France, at RC Paris from 1982 to 1986, during which period he played for Cameroon in the 1984 Olympic Football competition, alongside many of the team who would later play so well at the World Cup six years later. Ekéké spent the 1986–87 season at K.S.K. Beveren, in Belgium, before returning to France to Quimper for a couple of seasons, before his move to Valenciennes FC, for whom he was playing when he was called up for the 1990 World Cup.

After he retired from playing, Ekéké established a football academy in Douala and was appointed president of l’Union Camerounais des clubs amateurs de football (UCCAF).
Ekéké is now based in Douala, occasionally commenting on matters regarding the Indomitable Lions in the local media.
