He then started farming, while working as a farm credit counselor. In 1988 he was asked by Sarah Vogel, the Agriculture Commissioner at the time, to work for her and run the state's Agricultural Mediation Program, which helped farmers resolve financial problems with creditors.

Political career
Johnson was first elected Agriculture Commissioner in 1996 and re-elected in 2000, 2004, and 2006. The election in 1996 was one of the closest in North Dakota history.
