History
Most of the population of this region has historically been concentrated in coastal areas.  The first recorded history is centered at Chellah, an early Phoenician settlement at the edge of Rabat along the southern bank of the Oued Bou Regreg. Later the Romans took control and enlarged Chellah, whose ruins are today a prominent archaeological point of interest.  Chellah was a significant ancient port city town with remains including the Decumanus Maximus, a forum, a monumental fountain, a triumphal arch, and other ruins.

In the seventeenth century the first regional governmental entity was formed, unifying Rabat and Salé.  This regime was the headquarters of Barbary pirates and held sway over a turbulent time.
