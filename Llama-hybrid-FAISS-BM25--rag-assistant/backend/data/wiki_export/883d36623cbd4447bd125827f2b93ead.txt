Bronson was second son of dramatist, James Albery, and stage actress, Mary Moore. He was brother to politicians, Irving Albery & Wyndham Albery. Albery married Una Gwynn Rolleston.  

By 1953 Sir Bronson Albery was the name over the Criterion Theatre, leased from The Wyndham Theatres Ltd and licensed by the Lord Chamberlain.
