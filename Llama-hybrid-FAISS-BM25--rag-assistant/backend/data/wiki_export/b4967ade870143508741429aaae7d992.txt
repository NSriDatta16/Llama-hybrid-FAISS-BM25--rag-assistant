An, also romanized Ahn, is a Korean family name. 109 Korean clans are named 'An', but with different origins. In 2000, there were 637,786 people bearing this surname in South Korea, making it the 20th most common family name in the country, with roughly 2% of the country's population.  North Korea does not release figures for surnames, but the percentage is expected to be more than in South Korea.

Clan
In the traditional Korean clan system, which is still the basis of family registry in South Korea, each clan is distinguished by its bon-gwan, the notional ancestral seat of the clan. Typically each clan claims a different person as its founder, although there are exceptions. 109 An clans are extant today. However, most of these are very small. The majority of Ans claim membership in the Sunheung Ahn clan (the highest and most noble clan of Ans with the most well-known "blue-blood" status). The Kwangju and Juksan clans are also quite large and are associated with "blue-blood" status; in addition to these, the Tamjin, Gongsan, Chungju, Dongju, Jeuongwon, Ansan, Jecheon, Angang, and Jucheon clans are significant.

Sunheung Clan
73.5% of Korean surname 'Ahn' belongs to the Sunheung clan. The 2000 South Korean census counted 468,827 members of the "Sunheung" Ahn clan. It is a native clan connected with the town of Sunheung, Korea. The Sunheung Clan was the most noble and powerful clan among clans with surname An, and was one of the Six Greatest Clans of all Korean clans during the Goryeo Dynasty and early Joseon Dynasty.

Sunheung Clan in Goryeo Dynasty

They have enjoyed "blue-blood" status as nobility since their earliest history in the Goryeo dynasty and throughout the Joseon dynasty (July 1392 - August 1910). The founder of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan was a famous military commander of Goryeo named Ahn Ja-mi. He commanded Hongwiwi, the troop that escorted the Royal family, greeted foreign envoys, participated in national ceremonies, fought in wars, and guarded the frontier (border area) in Goryeo Dynasty. He was also honoured with the title of the supreme commander of Samhowi by King Sinjong of Goryeo. Founder Ahn Ja-mi had three sons, Ahn Yeong-yu, Ahn Yeong-rin, and Ahn Yeong-hwa. The Sunheung-Ahn Clan is divided into three different branches based on which of the three sons they descend from. The First Branch descending from Ahn Yeong-yu is called Lord (Duke) Chumil Branch (1파 추밀공파(樞密公派)). The Second Branch descending from Ahn Yeong-rin is called Lord (Duke) ByeolJang Branch (2파 별장공파(別將公派)). The Third Branch descending from Ahn Yeong-hwa is called Lord (Duke) Kyoseo Branch (3파 교서공파(校書公派)). From these three branches, there are 14 more sub-branches from the First Branch, four more sub-branches from the Second Branch, and four more sub-branches from the Third Branch.

The Sunheung-Ahn Clan became one of the most powerful and famous noble clans after An Hyang, who is the grandson of Ahn Yeong-yu (the founder of the Lord (Duke) Chumil Branch and the great-grandson of Ahn Jami, the founder of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan. An Hyang passed the Gwageo(State examination) in 1260(Wonjong 1). And he served as Docheomuijungchan(Vice-premier). An Hyang is considered the founder of Neo-Confucianism in Korea, introducing Song Confucianism to the Goryeo Kingdom. An Hyang is generally numbered among the clan's most illustrious members, and founded a branch of his own within the Sunheung-Ahn Clan, called Lord (Duke) Moonsun Sub-Branch (문성공파(文成公派)). Subsequent to An Hyang and for the rest of the Goryeo Dyasty, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan had members passing the Gwageo(State Examination) for 11 generations; 20 members of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan were made into Dukes or Grand Dukes (봉군(封君)), and produced 17 Daejehaks(대제학), which were then the highest office academics could reach in the Royal Court, equivalent to today's Ministers of Education.

Sunheung Clan in Joseon Dynasty

After the fall of the Goryeo Dynasty and the establishment of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan still remained one of the most powerful and famous noble clans, and was known for being one of the Six Greatest Clans in the kingdom. During the Joseon Dynasty, 641 members of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan passed the Gwageo(State Examination).

However, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan lost its power in the mid 15th century due to its support of King Danjong, a young king who was overthrown and then later assassinated by his uncle in the midst of political turmoil. The Sunheung-Ahn Clan led the movement to restore King Danjong back to the throne, which is one of the most well-known tragedies in the history of the Joseon Dynasty. Once the movement failed, the Sunheung-Ahn clan lost its status as one of the most prestigious clans in the kingdom, and members of the clan left the ancestral home of Sunheung and scattered around the kingdom to run away from the oppression of the government. The famous PiKkeut Village (End of the Blood Village, 피끝마을) resulted from the failure of this movement. The village gained its name from a massacre committed by the Joseon Dynasty on the 700 inhabitants of Sunheung, the ancestral home of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan, after the failure of the movement. The blood of the massacred people flowed in the stream and ended in PiKkeut Village, and thus the village got its name. The tragedy of Sunheung and PiKkeut Village was romanticised as the tragic fate of the Sunheung-Ahn Clan that stayed loyal to the young king, such as in DanJongEhSa (단종애사, 端宗哀史), a popular early 20th century Korean novel that described the life of King Danjong. Due to the Sunheung-Ahn clan's famous history of staying loyal to King Danjong, the surname An became synonymous with being stubborn and loyal. There are three Korean surnames often associated with being stubborn - An, Kang, and Choi - and among the three surnames, An is the most famous due to this tragic history.

As the consequence of the failure of the Danjong Restoration Movement, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan was charged with treason. The ancestral home of Sunheung was called the Land of Treason, and the clan could not regain its former power and glory for the rest of the Joseon Dynasty. Due to this, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan did not produce many famous figures for the rest of the Joseon Dynasty. However, the Sunheung-Ahn Clan produced many well-known members after the fall of the Joseon Dynasty in late 19th century.
