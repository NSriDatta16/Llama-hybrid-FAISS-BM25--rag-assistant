The origin of football in Águilas

Águilas FC was founded in 1925, but before the foundation of this one, other teams existed. In 1896 the Sporting Club Aguileño was founded. This team was the best of the region during the decade of 1900, because they won 26 matches of 26, without giving up a goal. The Sporting Club Aguileño disappeared in 1907 due to the lack of rivals. The Club Deportivo Aguileño was founded in 1907 and remained undefeated until 1917. The CD Aguileño folded in 1921 due to economic problems. Until 1925 the only teams in Águilas were the Arenas, Gimnástico and Universitari. In September 1924 the Region of Murcia Football Federation was created, but none of the Águilas teams enrolled in the federation; however, that year the Águilas FC played a match against Real Murcia.
