Seventh Truth is the fourth album by the Azeri jazz musician Aziza Mustafa Zadeh. It was released by Columbia Records in 1996. Zadeh reported that the cover caused some controversy in Azerbaijan because it featured nudity; she responded: "Why all the fuss? Maybe some women are jealous, or maybe they're too fat to appear like that themselves. Or maybe they're deaf and can't really comprehend what's going on in the music."
