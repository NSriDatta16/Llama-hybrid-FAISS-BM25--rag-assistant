Coombabah Conservation Area

Sometimes called Coombabah Lake, the Coombabah Lakelands is one of only five sites in Queensland included in the Ramsar international convention for significant wetlands. The conservation area is surrounded by homes, roads and businesses. The land was bought by Council in the 1980s as a buffer zone for a sewerage plant. In 1994 that Council declared the Coombabah Lakeland Conservation Area. The integrity of the conservation and animal habitat is overseen by several Authorities. There are ten kilometres worth of dirt tracks, gravel and boardwalks for access by the public. For marine habitat the area is a protected fish habitat under the Queensland Fisheries Act and a protected marine conservation and habitat zone under the Moreton Bay Marine Park Zoning plan. Guided bush walks day and night are run by the council's Natural Areas Management Unit. Three is a carpark on Rain Tree Glen for access to tracks.

Over 150 bird species use the area, so conservation of the wetlands aims to ensure migratory birds can use the area, and will continue to come.

A bird hide is accessed off Shelter Road. Brisbane/Gold Coast branch of Bird Observation and Conservation Australia organise guided bird watching visits.
