Samsun 19 Mayıs Stadium (), also known as Canik 19 Mayıs Stadium (Canik 19 Mayıs Stadyumu) from 2017 until its demolition in 2018, was a multi-purpose stadium in the Canik district of Samsun, northern Turkey.  It was used mostly for football matches and was the home ground of Samsunspor until the new Samsun 19 Mayıs Stadium was opened in 2017. The stadium had a seating capacity for 16,480 spectators. It was demolished in 2018.

The stadium was named in remembrance of the landing of Mustafa Kemal Pasha (1881–1938) in Samsun on May 19, 1919, to start the national independence movement.
