Etymology
'Langwathby' can be translated as 'long' ('lang'), 'ford' ('wath', Old Norse 'vað'), 'village' (Old English 'bȳ', Old Norse 'býr'), referring to the fording of the River Eden which runs along the edge of the village.
It is sometimes locally called Langanby.

History
In the 1600s, Langwathby moor was the site of a major racecourse.  The last race was held in 1699.

The Settle to Carlisle Railway has a railway station in the village, built in 1876. The station building is now a cafe.

The parish includes the nearby village of Edenhall which was a separate parish until 1934.

The ford which gave the village its name was replaced by a three-arched sandstone toll bridge, which was washed away in 1968. A metal girder bridge was erected as a “temporary” replacement.

At Langwathby Hall was the visitor attraction and working ostrich farm called Eden Ostrich World, which closed in 2012.

Governance
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north east to Gamblesby and south to Edenhall with a total population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,562.

Industry
At Langwathby there is a chicken processing factory and an animal feed mill.

At Barbary Plains just outside Edenhall, there was formerly a cement block works formerly owned by Hanson plc and later by RMC Group, part of Cemex. The site is now a depot and head office for a haulage company.
