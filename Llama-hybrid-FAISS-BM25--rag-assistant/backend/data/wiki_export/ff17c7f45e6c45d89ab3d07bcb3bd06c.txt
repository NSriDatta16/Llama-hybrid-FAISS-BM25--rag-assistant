Afa Anoa'i Jr. (born October 6, 1984) is an American professional wrestler. He is best known for his appearances with the professional wrestling promotion WWE in the late 2000s under the ring name Manu. He now owns BattleField Pro Wrestling, a promotion based in Pennsylvania.

Early life and education
Anoa'i attended Freedom High School in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, where he competed in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, known for producing top athletic talent in football, wrestling, and other sports. Anoai's  high school football coach Jim Morgans described him as "the best defensive lineman I've coached." As a senior, Anoa'i was named one of the 100 best football players in the United States by analyst Tom Lemming.

Following graduation from Freedom High School, Anoa'i attended Fork Union Military Academy as a postgraduate to study and play football. In 2003, he played in the All-American Bowl. Upon graduating, Anoa'i played football at the University of Connecticut for a year.

He began training as a professional wrestler under his father, Afa, and brothers, Lloyd (L.A. Smooth), and Samu. He made his debut on August 28, 1998, at the age of 13, winning a battle royal in Austria.

Professional wrestling career

World Xtreme Wrestling (1998–2006)
In 1998, Anoa'i joined the family promotion World Xtreme Wrestling, where he formed a stable with his brothers, Samu and Lloyd Anoa'i, known as Sons of Samoa. Anoa'i went on to win numerous championships.

World Wrestling Entertainment

Development territories (2006–2007)
In October 2006, Anoa'i received a try-out with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), held at the Deep South Wrestling development territory. Later that month, Anoa'i officially signed with WWE, going under his father's ring name, "Afa". He went on to wrestle for Deep South Wrestling. He initially was introduced as part of the stable Urban Assault, organized by Sonny Siaki, Eric Pérez, and Tyrus. They later lost to the Shane Twins, after which Afa replaced him. Urban Assault dissolved after Afa and Siaki abandoned Perez during a match against Doc Gallows and Tyrus.

Siaki and Afa reorganized as The Samoan Fight Club. Anoa'i then wrestled for WWE's new developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he continued teaming with Siaki under their Samoan Fight Club name. In 2007, however, their team was disbanded when Siaki was released from his contract following family issues. In October 2007, Afa Jr. defeated Davey Boy Smith Jr. by countout in the United Kingdom to become the new FCW Heavyweight Champion. In September, Afa Jr. began to work matches in Ohio Valley Wrestling, forming a tag team with fellow Samoan family member Matt Anoa'i. Their team was dubbed Sons of Samoa, which also was a stable that Afa Jr. formed when he was wrestling in World Xtreme Wrestling.

Main roster (2007–2009)

On November 19, 2007, Anoa'i made his debut on WWE under the name Mai Tai Anoa'i in a losing effort against Jim Duggan at WWE Heat. Anoa'i was later suspended by WWE for 30 days, on March 20, 2008, for violating WWE's Wellness Policy.

At Unforgiven in Cleveland, Anoa'i made his debut on the full-time roster under the name "Manu". He aligned himself with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, attacking Cryme Tyme after their World Tag Team Championship match. Later that night, the three helped Randy Orton attack the World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk and Kofi Kingston. On the  September 8, 2008 edition of WWE Raw, Manu, Rhodes, and DiBiase defeated Cryme Tyme and Kofi Kingston in a six-man tag team match. On the November 17 episode of Raw, Anoa'i made his singles debut in a losing effort against Dave Bautista.

Rhodes, DiBiase, and Manu entered a storyline with Randy Orton in which Orton was constantly criticizing and insulting them, and attacked DiBiase on the November 3 episode of Raw. Manu and Rhodes accepted Orton's offer for an alliance in the following weeks, and the trio dubbed themselves The Legacy.

After Orton tired of The Legacy losing matches, he scheduled a test for each member on the December 29 episode of Raw. Manu failed to pass his test after losing to ECW Champion Matt Hardy and being kicked out as his former companions Rhodes and Sim Snuka turned their backs on him. Later, Snuka also got kicked out of the group, and the two quickly reunited. They planned to obtain revenge against Orton and Rhodes on the January 12, 2009 episode of Raw with the aid of returning Ted DiBiase. DiBiase betrayed them, however, and joined The Legacy with Orton and Rhodes.

Anoa'i was released from his WWE contract on February 23, 2009.

Independent circuit (2009–present)
On April 18, 2009, two months after being released by WWE, Anoa'i returned to the independent circuit at a World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) show. He reformed the Sons of Samoa tag team with Samu, and the pair competed as a tag team throughout the rest of 2009. In 2010, Anoaʻi competed for the Belgian Catch Wrestling Federation and NWA Dawg Pound.

On February 9, 2013, Afa Jr. and L. A. Smooth, as The Sons of Samoa, won the WWC World Tag Team Championship. They lost their titles at Camino a la Gloria on March 30, 2013. However, they won them back on June 29, 2013 at Summer Madness. They lost the title at WWC 40 Aniversario to Chicano and Abbad. They regained them again on November 16, 2013 at Crossfire. However, they lost the title at Euphoria Day 2 against Xix Xavant and Chicano.

At the Regional Championship Wrestling event Rumblemania 9 in Reading, Pennsylvania on March 15, 2014, Manu and RC beat Rob Noxious in a respect match. This was a hardcore match that ended up going all over the building; after the match, Manu shook hands with Noxious and beat up RC, his manager.

Since 2014, Afa has been attached to Pennsylvania Premiere Wrestling (PPW) in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, capturing the promotions Heavyweight Championship and its No Limits Championship. Afa captured the PPW Title from his nephew Lance Anoa'i and retained the title against contenders, including Dan Maff and Samoa Joe. Afa defeated Al Snow at the December PPW Event to retain the PPW No Limits Title. In July 2017, he appeared on an NWA card in Morgan City, Louisiana, where he was defeated by NWA North American heavyweight champion Mustang Mike.
