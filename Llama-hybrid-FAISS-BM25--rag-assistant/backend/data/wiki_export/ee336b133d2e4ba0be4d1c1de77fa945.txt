Shaken 'n' Stirred is the third solo studio album by English singer Robert Plant, released on 20 May 1985 by Es Paranza, his own label. Plant, Benji Le Fevre, and Tim Palmer produced the album. Shaken 'n' Stirred peaked at No. 19 on the UK Albums Chart and at No. 20 on the US Billboard 200.

The album featured his second Mainstream Rock Tracks top hit, "Little by Little", which was No. 1 on the chart for two weeks and #36 on the Hot 100. "Sixes and Sevens" also charted on Mainstream chart, peaking at No. 18.

Rhino Entertainment released a remastered edition of the album, with one bonus track, on 20 March 2007.

On his podcast, Digging Deep, Plant remembers "Too Loud" as one song that was misunderstood. "I got some of Bette Midler’s girls to help me with some choruses and stuff," he says. "I basically was seriously affected by David Byrne [of Talking Heads]. It’s very funny, it’s a funny song, it’s supposed to be funny."
