The Collar City Bridge (also known as the Hoosick Street Bridge) carries NYS Route 7 (NYÂ 7) across the Hudson River connecting Colonie, New York with Troy, by way of passing over Green Island.  Though the northern terminus of Interstate 787 (I-787) is unclear, there is sign evidence of a concurrency at least halfway across the bridge.

History

The bridge had been planned since the 1950s, but did not open to traffic until 1981 connecting Troy and Green Island to I-787. By the end of the decade, the Route 7 Freeway was completed with a connection to the bridge.  The bridge's official name, a reference to the City of Troy's nickname, was selected by an elderly couple in nearby Berlin.
