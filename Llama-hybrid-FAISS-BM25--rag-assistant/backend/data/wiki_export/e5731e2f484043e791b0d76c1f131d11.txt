History

Quakenbrück was founded in 1234 by the Bishop of Osnabrück, according to the earliest documents, although the area had been settled previously. It served as a border to the north of Osnabrück.

On 29 May 1916, a nail man made from French poplar was given to the town by Clemens Freiherr von Schorlemer-Lieser and placed in the meeting room of the town hall. Revenue from the statue, which depicted a 13th-14th-century knight clad in armor and holding a shield and a sword and has come to be known as the Quakenbrück iron Knight (Quakenbrücker Eiserner Burgmann), were used to fuel the war effort. The statue was built by two soldiers from Schorlemer's Battalion.
