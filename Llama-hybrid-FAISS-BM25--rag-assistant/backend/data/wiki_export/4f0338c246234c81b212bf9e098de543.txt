As a Type II school district, the board's trustees are elected directly by voters to serve three-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with either one or two seats up for election each year held (since 2012) as part of the November general election. The board appoints a superintendent to oversee the district's day-to-day operations and a business administrator to supervise the business functions of the district.

On January 25, 2012, the Board voted, 3-1, to move school elections from April to November following the adoption of legislation allowing New Jersey school districts, municipal governing bodies, or citizen petition committees to do so.
