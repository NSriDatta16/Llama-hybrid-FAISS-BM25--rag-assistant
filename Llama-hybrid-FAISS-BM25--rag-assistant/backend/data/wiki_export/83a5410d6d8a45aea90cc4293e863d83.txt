The MIAA Division 1A Boy's Ice Hockey Tournament, commonly referred to as the Super Eight, is an annual boy's high school ice hockey tournament held by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) to determine the top boys' team in the state.

The tournament's future is in jeopardy. The Tournament Management Committee voted to not accept any Division 1A tournament proposals until at least the 2025–26 academic year. If the MIAA Board of Directors votes to side with the TMC, then no Division 1A boy's ice hockey tournament would be held until 2026 at the earliest. The Ice Hockey Committee will appeal the decision.

History 
The Super Eight is a double-elimination tournament that has determined the high school state champion since the inaugural 1991 tournament. The tournament features 10 teams. The selection committee seeds the teams 1 to 10. The tournament begins with two play-in games culminating with the finals played at TD Garden. The games leading up to the finals have been scheduled at neutral sites, including Tsongas Center, Chelmsford Forum, and other rinks in the state. The tournament is the basis for the creation of the Division 1A baseball tournament, which was established in 2014, to crown a state champion.

On March 12, 2020, the MIAA announced that the state finals games across all divisions scheduled for that weekend would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, Arlington and Pope Francis were both declared co-champions for the first time in the Super Eight tournament. The MIAA did not sponsor winter tournaments in 2021, thus no Super Eight was held.

On April 16, 2021, the MIAA Tournament Management Committee voted to accept the Blue Ribbon Committee's proposal that they will “not consider any applications for a 1A Tournament until July 1, 2025, to ensure MIAA sport committees can support their applications with four years of data under the new statewide tournament structure starting in the fall 2021 season.” The Blue Ribbon Committee cited "consistency, equity, and Title IX compliance across all sports" as the reasoning. The MIAA Division 1A Boy's Ice Hockey Tournament along with the Division 1A baseball tournament cannot return until the 2025–26 academic year if the committee votes to approve. The TMC believes that the 4-year gap will allow sports committees to gather substantial data with the new statewide tournament to better support their future proposals for a Division 1A tournament. However, the Board of Directors must approve the TMC vote before it becomes official.

On April 29, the MIAA Ice Hockey Committee announced that they will appeal the decision made by the TMC.
