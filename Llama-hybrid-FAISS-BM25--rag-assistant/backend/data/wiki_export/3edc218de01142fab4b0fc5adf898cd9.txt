Herrion began his college coaching career in 1985 as an assistant under Mike Jarvis at Boston University.  He followed Jarvis to George Washington University before striking out on his own as a head coach. In April 1991, Herrion was hired to coach Drexel after Dayton assistant Tom McConnell turned down the job. Herrion later coached at East Carolina and UNH.

He is one of the most successful men's coaches in the history of the America East Conference.  The Drexel Dragons won 3 conference championships in a row under Herrion's leadership from 1994 to 1996. In 1998, on the occasion of the conference's 20th anniversary, he was named one of the four most influential coaches in the conference's history: the other three coaches were Jarvis, Rick Pitino and Hall of Famer Jim Calhoun.  He holds the conference record for most playoff wins (18 with Drexel, 1 with UNH, for a total of 19.)

On December 4, 2010, he won his 300th game when UNH beat Colgate, 65–60, and earned his 400th career win on January 10, 2018 in a 71–67 win over Binghamton.
