History

Diemtigen is first mentioned in 1257 as Diemtingen.

The Diemtigen area was inhabited during the Bronze Age and possibly during the Mesolithic Era.  It was permanently inhabited and fortified by the High Middle Ages.  The heights above the valleys are home to several castles or castle ruins.  No records exist and very little is known about the ruins of Kronegg Castle, above Eggwald, and Grafenstein Castle, above Oey.  The third castle, Hasenburg near Diemtigen was first mentioned in 1257 as castrum de Diemtingen and in the 12th and 13th centuries was the seat of the Freiherr von Strättligen.  After the 12th century the castle and lands passed through several noble families until the Bernese von Scharnachtal family acquired it and in 1439 sold it to the city of Bern.  A set of laws and privileges were granted to the villagers of the entire valley in 1361 and again in 1393.  In 1649 the laws governing the entire valley were codified.  Beginning in the 15th century passes from the Diemtigen valley into Adelboden, Lenk and Zweisimmen opened up local trade.  By the 16th century, the villagers in the valley bought grain from the lowlands, raised cattle in alpine meadows and then exported the cattle over the passes.  While a little silver and coal were found in the mountains, there was never enough to support mines.  Due to limited farmland and poverty, many residents left the valley.  Before the 19th century it was into mercenary service, while after 1800 they emigrated to North America, Germany or Russia.  Following the 1798 French invasion, Diemtigen became part of the Helvetic Republic Canton of Oberland.  With the Act of Mediation in 1803 it returned to the Canton of Bern.

Beginning in the 18th century, several alpine spas were built around natural mineral springs.  Two of the most famous, the Rothbad Horben and the Kurhaus Grimmialp in Schwenden opened the village up to tourism.  The construction of Simmentalstrasse (Simmental road) and the Spiez-Zweisimmen railroad in 1897 opened up the valley to many new businesses and brought in an increasing number of tourists.  The railroad station was built in the village of Oey, which grew into the population and administrative center of the municipality.  In 1963 the municipality built a hotel and sport complex to encourage further tourism.  Today, tourism is an important component in the local economy.  However, agriculture still remains important and Diemtigen has 107 seasonal alpine pastures, the most of any Swiss municipality.

The village church of St. Nicholas in Diemtigen village was first mentioned in 1314 and was a filial church of the parish church in Schwenden.  The original building was extended in 1490.  In 1527 the valley adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and the village church became a parish church for the new Reformed parish of Diemtigen.

The scattered nature of the municipality made this more difficult, because there are many scattered land owners with different goals.  However, the municipality was able to create a number of large landscape protection zones, which limited and concentrated holiday house areas to a few places.
