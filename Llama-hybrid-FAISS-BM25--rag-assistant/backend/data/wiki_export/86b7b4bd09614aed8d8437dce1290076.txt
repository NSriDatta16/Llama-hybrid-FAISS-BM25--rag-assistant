History 
SBI Route 94 ran from Taylor Ridge, west of U.S. 67, to La Harpe, at Illinois 9. There was also a spur to Alexis, northwest of Galesburg. In March 1937 that spur was changed to Illinois Route 135, and the main route extended south to Bowen, replacing Illinois Route 94A, parts of Illinois Route 96 and Illinois Route 36. In 1955 it was extended further south to its current terminus, partially replacing Illinois Route 102. It was also extended north to U.S. 67.

Illinois 36 also ran on portions of Illinois Route 61 and U.S. Route 36.
