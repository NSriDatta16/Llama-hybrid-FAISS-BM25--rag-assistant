Roberta Corti (21 March 1936 – 15 June 2006), better known by her stage name Betty Curtis, was an Italian singer active from 1957 to 2004.

Curtis grew up in the Zone 8 of Milan's borough Cagnola. She started singing in night clubs at an early age and was discovered by Teddy Reno in 1958. Her debut single was a rendition of With All My Heart performed with the Franco Pisano Orchestra.

Curtis' song "Al di là", performed together with Luciano Tajoli, won the Sanremo Music Festival in 1961. Betty Curtis represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1961 with her San Remo winning song, which tied for fifth in Cannes.

In 1965 she returned to Sanremo with "Invece no".

Curtis's version of "Chariot" (I Will Follow Him) was used in the soundtrack of Martin Scorsese's film Goodfellas (1990).
