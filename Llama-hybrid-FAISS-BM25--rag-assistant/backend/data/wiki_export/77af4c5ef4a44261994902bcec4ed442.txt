Delmore played 283 games in the National Hockey League (NHL), recording 43 goals and 58 assists for 101 points. He was considered an offensive defenceman, valued for his proficiency on the power play. He is currently an assistant coach with the Windsor Spitfires of the OHL.

Playing career
A 6'0" defenceman, Delmore played junior hockey for the North Bay Centennials and later for the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He went undrafted in 1997 and signed as a free agent with the Philadelphia Flyers, making his NHL debut during the 1998–99 season. Delmore was the first rookie defenceman to record a hat-trick in the playoffs. He also scored the overtime winner in Game 3 of the 2000 Eastern Conference Semifinals as Philadelphia defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4–3. While playing for the Nashville Predators during the 2002–03 NHL season, he tied Sergei Gonchar and Nicklas Lidström for most goals (18) by a defenseman.

Delmore was traded twice on March 9, 2004; the Sabres first traded him to the San Jose Sharks (along with Curtis Brown) for Jeff Jillson and a ninth-round draft pick, and he was then traded again to the Boston Bruins for future considerations. He did not see any game action for Boston through the end of the season. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Delmore played in Germany with Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).

Delmore signed with the Detroit Red Wings to a one-year contract on August 16, 2005. However, he did not play a regular season game for the club and was claimed by the Columbus Blue Jackets off waivers on October 4, 2005. Delmore played the majority of the 2005–06 season for the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League (AHL), playing only seven games in the NHL. He won the Eddie Shore Award as the top defenceman in the AHL and was named to the AHL First All-Star Team.

On July 1, 2006, Delmore signed a one-year contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was then assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons, to start the 2006–07 season. After 47 games with the Falcons, Delmore was traded by the Lightning (along with André Deveaux) to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for Kyle Wanvig and Stephen Baby on February 1, 2007.

Delmore returned to Germany when he signed a two-year contract with the Hamburg Freezers of the DEL on July 17, 2007.

After a two-year absence, Delmore returned to North America for the 2009–10 season when the Detroit Red Wings again signed Delmore to a one-year contract on July 28, 2009. Delmore was then assigned to their AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins. On March 3, 2010, he was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for Riley Armstrong. He was then assigned to Flames' AHL affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat.

On October 24, 2010, Delmore left again for Europe to sign a one-year contract with Norwegian team Lørenskog IK. Delmore spent the following two seasons amongst the Austrian Hockey League and Italian Serie A before announcing his retirement at the conclusion of the 2012–13 season.
