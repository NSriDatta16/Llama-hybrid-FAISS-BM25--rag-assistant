Hotel and design 
After finishing acting, Hempel has embarked in a career as a hotelier and interior designer. In 2002, she was ranked by Architectural Digest'' as one of the top 100 interior designers and architects in the world.

Hotels
Hempel has established four hotels. Blakes Hotel was created in 1978 as one of the world's first luxury boutique hotels. Based in South Kensington, it is well known for its design, quality of service and privacy. The hotel's restaurant has become a destination in its own right, featuring a fusion of Hempel's favourite cuisines of Japanese and Italian. Her second hotel, the Hempel Hotel, was noted as a minimalist hotel. Blakes Amsterdam was opened in 1999, drawing inspiration from Amsterdam's historic Dutch East India Company.

In 1964, she married Constantine Hempel, with whom she had a son and daughter.  He was a journalist and property developer who was killed in 1973, crashing his car into a basement in Pimlico.
