"Close to You" is a song by English reggae singer Maxi Priest. It was released in 1990 as the lead single from his fifth album Bonafide (1990). "Close to You" reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, number two on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and number seven on the UK Singles Chart.

Critical reception
Ron Wynn from AllMusic said the song "is more pop/R&B with a reggae touch than it is real reggae." A reviewer from Music & Media commented, "After a tougher than normal start, this song quickly becomes another Maxi Priest single like all the others. Nice melody and well sung." David Giles from Music Week wrote, "A discernible step in the soul direction from the reggae maestro. Though the emphasis is still firmly on melody and honeyed vocals, the rhythm leans dancefloor-wards. Very commercial."

Music videos
The music video features Priest singing while the background features people in Egypt. There is also a second version, which takes place inside of a soundstage. The song was also featured in the film Sleeping with the Enemy.
