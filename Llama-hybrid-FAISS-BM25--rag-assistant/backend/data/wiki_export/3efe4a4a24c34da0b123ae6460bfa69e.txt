The Lancashire Combination was a football league founded in the North West of England in 1891â€“92. It absorbed the Lancashire League in 1903. In 1968 the Combination lost five of its clubs to the newly formed Northern Premier League. In 1982 it was finally merged with the Cheshire County League to form the North West Counties League.
