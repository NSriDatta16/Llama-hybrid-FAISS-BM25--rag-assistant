Organisation

Latin Church Catholics
Within Montenegro the Latin Church Catholic hierarchy consists of the Archdiocese of Bar. The Diocese of Kotor is geographically located in Montenegro, but it is administratively part of the church in Croatia and is subject to the Archdiocese of Split-Makarska of that country. The territory of the Diocese of Kotor (Venetian: Cattaro) corresponds to the territory of Albania Veneta of the Republic of Venice, lost to Napoleon I in 1797 (Albania Veneta was mostly Catholic).

Eastern Catholics 

There are very few Greek Catholics of Montenegro, and no diocese. The Greek Catholics are assigned to the pastoral care of the Latin Church clergy of the Catholic Church in Montenegro.
