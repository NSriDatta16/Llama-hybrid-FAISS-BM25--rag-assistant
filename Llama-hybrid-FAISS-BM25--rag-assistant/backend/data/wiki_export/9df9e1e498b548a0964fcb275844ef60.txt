My Friends Tigger & Pooh is an American computer-animated children's television series on the Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel. It was inspired by A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh. The series was developed by Walt Disney Television Animation and executive producer Brian Hohlfeld.

Premise 
The series features Winnie the Pooh and other characters from Disney adaptations of Winnie-the-Pooh. It also introduces two new characters, an imaginative 6-year-old red-headed girl named Darby and her dog Buster. Darby is the main protagonist and an amateur sleuth. Her older best friend is Christopher Robin, who has grown up and makes two appearances over the course of the series. Darby teams up with Winnie the Pooh and Tigger to form the trio of Super Sleuths, and investigate mysteries in the Hundred Acre Wood.

Production 
In 2005, it was announced that Disney was creating a new television series, with a new female character replacing Christopher Robin as the protagonist. My Friends Tigger & Pooh was developed by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation from Japanese company Polygon Pictures, and was executive produced and story edited by Brian Hohlfeld. After voicing Piglet in Pooh's Heffalump Halloween Movie, Travis Oates reprises his role, taking over for John Fiedler, who died on June 25, 2005, two years prior to the debut of the series. It also marks the final time Peter Cullen, Ken Sansom and Kath Soucie provide the respective voices of Eeyore, Rabbit and Kanga, as all three would be recast in 2011's Winnie the Pooh. Cullen later reprises Eeyore in the 2017 Doc McStuffins special "Into the Hundred Acre Wood."
