The Gambila River (Pashto and ), also called the Tochi River (), is located in Khost Province, Afghanistan, and North Waziristan and Bannu District, northwestern Pakistan.

The source of the river lies in the hills six miles south of the SpÄ«n Ghar range, the source of the Kurram River, to which it runs parallel and finally joins.  It borders North Waziristan while the Gomal River borders South Waziristan.

The Gambila is an important river for the inhabitants of the Dawar valley, as it serves to irrigate a large area of land that it runs through, particularly that belonging to the Takhti Khel Marwats, Bakkakhel Wazirs, and Miri and Barakzai Bannuchis.
