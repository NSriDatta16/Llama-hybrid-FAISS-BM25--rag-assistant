You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat is a 1971 low-budget comedy-drama film directed by Peter Locke. The story concerns a young hippie and his search in New York City for the meaning of life.

The film is notable for early-career appearances by several artists: Richard Pryor has a small role playing his signature "wino" character; Wes Craven made his professional debut as the film's editor; the film's soundtrack was co-written and performed by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, who went on to form Steely Dan.

As of 2023 the film is considered lost, although the soundtrack survives.

Plot
Young idealistic hippie Carter Fields visits New York City's Central Park to try to find meaning in his life. He meets an array of strange characters, his girlfriend becomes pregnant, and he gets mixed up with a gang of pickpockets. He marries his girlfriend and finds a job in advertising on Madison Avenue. But Fields is one of life's losers: he's fired for incompetence, and his wife deserts him. He returns to Central Park with his child.

Production 
The film was shot entirely on location in New Yok City. In an interview on the Los Angeles KPFK Radio Captain Midnight Show in 1977, Walter Becker says of the film: "It was underbudgeted, which means that some of the exposures didn’t match some of the others so you could tell where the new pieces and the old pieces were".

Critical reception 
Critical reception was largely negative. A.H. Weiler in The New York Times wrote that the film: "projects lots of walking and talking but precious little heartfelt beat, despite its willing cast and a plethora of sight gags and surface philosophies." Variety said: "The film moves in spurts of hilarity with too many lags in between." In the New York Daily News Ann Guarino wrote: "Masquerading as satire, the comedy as written, produced and directed by 27-year-old Peter Locke, is sophomoric and absolutely dull." The film is described by TV Guide as "A mishmash of intent and execution and too annoyingly clumsy to watch."

The Independent Film Journal said: "This film's satire never touches reality in an effective enough way for it to hit its marks." Archer Winsten in the New York Post wrote: "It is a picture that leaves a dent on your consciousness because it goes out of its way to do so, but when you try to remember what it was about, ten minutes afterwards it has vanished, like something very wet poured on sand."
