The Norwegian Society of Pediatricians () is the Norwegian association of pediatricians.

The society was founded in 1919 by Axel Johannessen, the first professor of pediatrics in Norway. The society was originally named the Norwegian Pediatric Society (), and was an independent association from its establishment. In 1928 it formally became a specialist association within the Norwegian Medical Association.

As of 2012, the society had 845 members, including 593 certified specialists in pediatrics. The society's journal is called Paidos – Journal of the Norwegian Society of Pediatricians (παιδός paidos is genitive of Greek παῖς país, child), and was established in 1983.
