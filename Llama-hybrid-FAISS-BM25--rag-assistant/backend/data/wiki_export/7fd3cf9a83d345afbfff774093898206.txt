The Holland–Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency is a four-member Group Representation Constituency (GRC) located in the central, western and northern areas of Singapore. Holland–Bukit Timah GRC is known as amongst the wealthiest electoral divisions in the entire country, due to the predominance of Good Class Bungalows (GCB) landed homes, which are predominantly owned by the wealthiest citizens within the country. The GRC consists of four divisions: Cashew, Bukit Timah, Ulu Pandan and Zhenghua. The current MPs are Sim Ann, Vivian Balakrishnan,  Christopher de Souza and Edward Chia from the People's Action Party (PAP).

History
Originally known as the Holland–Bukit Panjang Group Representation Constituency, it was renamed to its present name due to the Bukit Panjang ward of the GRC being carved out to form a Single Member Constituency, in return the Bukit Timah Single Member Constituency was absorbed. A large portion of Holland–Bukit Timah GRC is made up of jungle and nature reserve, namely the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Central Water Catchment.
