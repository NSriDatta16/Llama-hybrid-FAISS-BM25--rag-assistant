History 

Bonnybridge developed greatly during the industrial revolution in the nineteenth century. Significant industries that were established include paper milling, sawmilling, chemical manufacturing, refractory brick manufacture and whisky distilling. Particularly important for Bonnybridge was the establishment of several iron foundries including the famous Smith and Wellstood Foundry, which was important in introducing the American metal heating stoves to Europe under the 'Esse stoves' brand. The output from these foundries was transported via the Forth & Clyde Canal to local markets, and also to Glasgow for export. Bonnybridge was also particularly well served by rail, with the Glasgow to Edinburgh, Kilsyth and Bonnybridge and the Carlisle to Perth lines both nearby. With the canal and rail links Bonnybridge became a centre for industrial production.

Education
The town has three primary schools: Bonnybridge Primary School, Antonine Primary School and St. Joseph's R.C. Primary School. The former two are catchment primaries for Denny High School and the latter is within the catchment area of St. Mungo's High School.
