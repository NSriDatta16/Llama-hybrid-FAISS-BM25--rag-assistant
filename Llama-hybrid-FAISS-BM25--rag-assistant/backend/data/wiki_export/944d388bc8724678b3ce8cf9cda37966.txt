The Tennis Channel Open was a men's tennis tournament on the ATP International Series which was held for the first time in Las Vegas, Nevada from February 27 to March 5, 2006.  In the men's singles final, James Blake defeated Lleyton Hewitt while the men's doubles title was won by Bob and Mike Bryan.

In 2005, The Tennis Channel purchased the tournament from IMG and moved it from Scottsdale to Las Vegas. In April 2008, The Tennis Channel announced that it was selling the tournament to the ATP, and the week the event had been held was now the first week of Davis Cup.
