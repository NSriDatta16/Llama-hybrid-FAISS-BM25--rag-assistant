Ripple Rock is The Evaporators' third album. It was released in 2004 in Canada by Mint Records and Nardwuar Records and elsewhere by Alternative Tentacles. The vinyl contained a free copy of Thee Dublins' self-titled 7". On the CD, these songs were included at the end of the album along with an extra "introduction" track, as well as several music videos and interviews that could be accessed by putting the CD into a CD-ROM drive.

Differences between the CD and the vinyl
There are several differences between the vinyl and CD releases of Ripple Rock. The art and layout are slightly different, with the CD having the edge on quantity, although the record obviously offers larger images. The most notable difference is that the last five tracks on the CD are taken off the vinyl, although four of them make their way onto a 7" insert. The 8-Track release has the same track listing as the vinyl release.
