The Marco Polo Front (, FMP)  was an autonomist and  Venetist political party active in Veneto, named after explorer Marco Polo.

Fabio Padovan, leader of the European Federalist Free Entrepreneurs (LIFE) and former deputy of Liga Veneta–Lega Nord, and Giorgio Vido, another former deputy of LV–LN, formed FMP in 1999 in view of the 2000 regional election. Padovan gained 1.7% of the vote in the election, while FMP stopped at 1.3%. In 2001 the party was merged into Liga Fronte Veneto.
