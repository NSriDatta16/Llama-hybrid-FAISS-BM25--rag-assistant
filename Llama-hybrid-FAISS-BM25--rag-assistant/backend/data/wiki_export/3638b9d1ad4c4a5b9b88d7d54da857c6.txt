Steffen Wesemann (born 11 March 1971) is a Swiss-German former professional road racing cyclist.

He competed in the individual road race at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Wesemann most recently rode for the professional continental team Cycle Collstrop after riding a year with the Team Wiesenhof–Felt squad. He had previously spent the other years of his career at Telekom who later became Team T-Mobile. He rode and completed the Vuelta a España on three occasions in 1995, 1996 and 2003 and finished the Tour de France twice in 1999 and 2002.

In September 2005, Wesemann and his family, longtime residents of Küttigen, Switzerland, obtained Swiss citizenship.  He was a specialist in the one-day Spring Classics—winner of the 2004 Tour of Flanders and 5-time champion of the Peace Race.
