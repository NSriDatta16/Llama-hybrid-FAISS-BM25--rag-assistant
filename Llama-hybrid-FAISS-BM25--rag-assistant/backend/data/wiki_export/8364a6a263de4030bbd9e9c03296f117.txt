Blackville is a former village in Northumberland County, New Brunswick, Canada. It is now part of the rural community of Miramichi River Valley.

History

The first post office opened in the area in 1842, under the community name "Decantillon's"; the area known as The Forks was also serviced by this post office. In 1847, these areas collectively became known as Blackville, as the area was the largest population centre in the Parish of Blackville. The parish, created in 1830 when it was partitioned from the Parish of Ludlow, had been named in honour of William Black, the acting governor of the colony of New Brunswick from 1829 to 1831.

Blackville was first incorporated as a village in 1967, annexing the neighbouring communities of Underhill and Breadalbane later that year.

On January 1, 2023, Blackville amalgamated with all or part of eight local service districts to form the new incorporated rural community of Miramichi River Valley. Blackville remains in official use.
