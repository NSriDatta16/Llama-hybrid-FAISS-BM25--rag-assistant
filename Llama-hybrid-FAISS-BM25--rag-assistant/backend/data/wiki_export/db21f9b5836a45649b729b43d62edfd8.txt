In the year 1927, Tamnaharry Park became a convent when the (Irish) Dominican Sisters of South Africa purchased the property. The new Convent Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption was dedicated, and its high altar consecrated, by Bishop Mulhern on 24 May 1939. Dr P. Clery, O.P., Dean of Dublin, preached the dedication sermon. By 1945, the Sisters had acquired a new novitiate in County Kildare and were succeeded in Tamnaharry by the Sisters of St Joseph of the Apparition. The house remained in religious hands until 1969, when the Morton Family of Banbridge bought it.
