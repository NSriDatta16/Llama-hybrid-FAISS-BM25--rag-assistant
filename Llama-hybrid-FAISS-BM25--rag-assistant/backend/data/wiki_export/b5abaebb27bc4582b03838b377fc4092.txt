The Magnum Research BFR is a single-action revolver manufactured by Magnum Research. Modeled after the Ruger Blackhawk, it is constructed of stainless steel and chambered for a number of powerful handgun cartridges, such as .460 S&W Magnum and .500 S&W Magnum; popular rifle chamberings, including .30-30 WCF, .444 Marlin, and .45-70 Government; and even .410 bore shotshells. Notably, the BFR platform has also served as the basis for custom caliber conversions to 19th century big game cartridges such as the .50-110 WCF and .50-90 Sharps, as well as the .500 Bushwhacker, which is currently considered to be the most powerful handgun cartridge in the world in terms of muzzle energy. The name "BFR" originally stood for “Brainerd’s First Revolver”, in reference to Brainerd, Minnesota, where the early BFRs were manufactured. Officially the acronym now stands for "Biggest, Finest Revolver", though it was rebranded for a time as the “Big Frame Revolver” after Magnum Research’s 2010 acquisition by Kahr Arms. It is sometimes referred to as the "Big Fucking Revolver", but this is a misnomer often used for humorous effect and has never been officially sanctioned by manufacturers.

Available cartridges
The BFR comes in two basic models, one with a long cylinder for larger rifle cartridges, and one with a more traditional revolver cylinder length (called "short" by Magnum Research). Some models that use identical bores, such as the .45-70 Government and .450 Marlin, can be made with two cylinders for the same gun.

The BFR revolvers were originally made by D-MAX in Springfield, South Dakota, until Magnum Research bought them out.
