The Senate of Thailand (, , ; formerly known as the Phruetthasapha, , , ) is the upper house of the National Assembly of Thailand, Thailand's legislative branch. In accordance with the 2017 constitution of Thailand, the Senate is a non-partisan legislative chamber, composed of 250 members. There are no elections for the Senate – all 250 Senators are appointed by the Royal Thai Military. Senators serve five year terms in office.

Both the Senate and the House of Representatives were abolished as a result of the 2014 Thai coup d'état. These were replaced with the unicameral National Legislative Assembly, a body of 250 members, selected by the National Council for Peace and Order. The 2017 constitution, which was approved by a referendum in 2016, provided for a 250-members Senate, which was not elected but rather appointed by a special committee, which was itself appointed by the military. As such, it has been often considered as a rubber stamp for decisions already taken by the higher-ups of the military junta.

History
The idea of bicameralism first permeated Thai politics with the Constitution of 1946, when the government of Pridi Banomyong introduced a Senate modelled on the British House of Lords. For the first time, an upper house came into existence in Thailand. The Senate was to be fully elected, however, the elections would be indirect, as the House of Representatives would elect the senators, for six-year terms. The 1946 Constitution was soon abrogated in a military coup. Subsequent constitutions saw only occasional bicameralism, and when it did exist, the Senate was always filled with appointees from the military and the elite. The 1997 constitution saw a return to a fully elected Senate. That constitution was abrogated after the 2006 coup, and replaced with one calling for a half-elected/half-appointed Senate. The 2007 Constitution was itself repealed in 2018 following the 2014 coup, and replaced with a new one which provided for a fully appointed Senate.

Fifty senators represent ten professional and forty social groups: bureaucrats, teachers, judges, farmers, and private companies. A shortlist of 200 were proposed to the NCPO which made the final selection of fifty. The remaining six Senate positions are reserved for the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, the defence permanent secretary, the national police chief, and the heads of the army, navy, and air force, who are all senators ex officio. , 104 out of the 250 senators are police or military officers.

Membership

Membership of an elected Senator began on the senate election day, while an appointed senator became a member after the publication of the election result by the Electoral Commission. Senators could not hold more than one consecutive term, therefore senators could not be re-elected. A Senator whose membership expired before a new Senator could be named continued his or her duties until such seats were occupied. If there was a vacancy the seat was immediately filled either by election or appointment.
