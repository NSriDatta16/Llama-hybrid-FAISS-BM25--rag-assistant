Rick Hansen Secondary is a public high school in the neighborhood of Townline Hill, located in the west part of Abbotsford, British Columbia. It is part of School District 34 Abbotsford.

Rick Hansen Secondary School (RHSS) is named after Rick Hansen, an athlete who won all-star awards in five sports when he was paralyzed at the age of 15 after being thrown from the back of a truck. He subsequently became a paraplegic athlete and activist for people with spinal cord injuries. The school usually takes in graduates from the nearby Eugene Reimer Middle School, and serves a predominantly Desi & South East Asian community.

In 2015–2016, the school suspended many of its programs such as various clubs, sports teams, concert band and its cafeteria due to the low number of students. The school saw record low enrolment as recent as 2016 and 2017, where it dropped to 591 students, compared to 938 in 2007.

On October 19, 2020, a student collapsed and died following a medical incident in class.

The school is a sister school to Rick Hansen Secondary School in Mississauga, Ontario.
