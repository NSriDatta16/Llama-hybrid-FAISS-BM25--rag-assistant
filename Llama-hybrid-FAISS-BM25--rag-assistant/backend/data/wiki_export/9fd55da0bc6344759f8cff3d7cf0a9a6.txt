History
Nord-Vågsøy was originally a part of the municipality of Selje (see formannskapsdistrikt law).  On 1 January 1910, the western part of Selje was split off from the municipality to create the new municipalities of Nord-Vågsøy (population: 1,111) and Sør-Vågsøy (population: 1,517).  On 1 July 1921, the Blesrød farm in Nord-Vågsøy (just north of Måløy) was transferred to Sør-Vågsøy municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.
