Afterward, Wilde was attacked by the duo of Sky and Angelina Love (known as The Beautiful People) and was given the 'Brown Paper Bag Treatment', before ODB and Gail Kim could make the save. On the September 11 episode of Impact, Wilde beat Love in the first ever "Beautiful People Beauty Pageant", but was attacked by the Beautiful People, causing Rhino to make the save for a second time. At No Surrender she was accompanied by Rhino when she defeated Love. Wilde won a Triple Threat match at Bound for Glory against Awesome Kong and Roxxi to keep the title. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Wilde lost the championship to Kong after interference from Saeed.

At Genesis she teamed once again with Roxxi and ODB to defeat Rhaka Khan, Raisha Saeed and Sojourner Bolt. The next week on Impact! Wilde, Roxxi and ODB defeated the Kongtourage once more.

Soon after Wilde and Roxxi would continue to have series of tag team matches against The Beautiful People. On February 12, she competed in a 9 wrestler Gauntlet match which was won by Sojourner Bolt. At Destination X, she teamed with Roxxi and The Governor to defeat The Beautiful People and Madison Rayne in a six-woman tag team match.

The following week, Lauren and Taylor were shown sitting at a table, waiting for the admirer to arrive. Soon, Daffney arrived, attacking and choking Taylor, blaming her for The Beautiful People cutting her hair off, and in the process, challenging her to the first ever Monster's Ball match at Sacrifice, which Wilde won. From the feud with Daffney, it was shown that Wilde is on-screen best friends with backstage interviewer, Lauren. Wilde and her tag team partner Abyss defeated Daffney and Raven in a Monster's Ball match at Slammiversary, thus ending her feud with Daffney.

Storyline with Sarita (2009–2010)

In August, Wilde formed an alliance with Sarita after TNA announced that they were going to crown new Knockouts Tag Team Champions. On the September 10 edition of Impact!, Wilde and Sarita advanced the semifinals of the Tag Team Championship tournament by defeating Alissa Flash and Daffney. The following week on Impact!, they advanced to the finals of the tournament by defeating Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed.

Wilde and Sarita made their return in the March 8 edition of Impact!, unsuccessfully challenging for the vacant Tag Team titles. On the June 25 edition of Xplosion, Wilde defeated Daffney after interference from Sarita, ending the team's long losing streak. On the following week, Wilde confronted her tag team partner and explained that she didn't want to win by cheating, which led to Sarita displaying a villainous persona by claiming that she is a winner and, unlike Wilde, doesn't need her tag team partner's help in her match against Daffney. After Sarita was defeated by Daffney in a singles match, Wilde ran out to the ring and stopped her tag team partner from attacking her opponent. After being defeated by Women's Knockout Champion Madison Rayne on the July 1 edition of Impact!, Wilde's alliance with Sarita came to an end, when Sarita turned heel and attacked her, proclaiming she was sick of losing matches.

Wilde and Sarita faced each other on the following edition of Xplosion, with Sarita picking up the pinfall victory by holding her trunks. On the July 15 edition of Impact! Sarita defeated Wilde again, this time in a Street Fight.
