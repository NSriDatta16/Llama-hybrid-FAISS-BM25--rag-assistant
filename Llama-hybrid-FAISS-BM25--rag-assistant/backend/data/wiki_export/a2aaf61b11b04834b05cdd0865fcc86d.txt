Montana Highway 3 (MT 3) is a highway in central Montana extending north from Billings to Great Falls.

Route description
At its southern end, MT 3 begins at I-90 in Billings and travels northwest  to US 12 near Lavina – this is the only section of MT 3 that is not concurrent with a US highway. MT 3 joins US 12 and travels  west to Harlowton, where it leaves US 12 and joins US 191, and travels north for  to Eddie's Corner (near Moore). At Eddie's Corner, MT 3 turns west, leaving US 191 and joining the US 87 / MT 200 concurrency, and travels west  to Armington where US 89 joins the highway. The four highways continue  to Great Falls, where it follows a  concurrency with I-315 and ends at I-15.

MT 3 is part of the Camino Real Corridor (Corridor 27), a High Priority Corridor that connects El Paso, Texas to the Canada–United States border at Sweet Grass, Montana. The corridor is anchored by Interstate 25 and is part of the larger Ports-to-Plains Alliance. MT 3 is connected to the Canadian border via I-15, and is connected to I-25 in Buffalo, Wyoming via I-90.
