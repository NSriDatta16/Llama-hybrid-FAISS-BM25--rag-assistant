Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American animated television series created and directed by John R. Dilworth. The pilot episode, "The Chicken from Outer Space", originally aired as part of What a Cartoon! on February 18, 1996. The series officially premiered on Cartoon Network on November 12, 1999, and ended on November 22, 2002, with a total of 52 episodes over the course of four seasons. A CGI special titled "The Fog of Courage" was broadcast on Cartoon Network in Southeast Asia on October 31, 2014.
