The Looks is the debut album by Mstrkrft, released on 18 July 2006. All songs were written by Jesse F. Keeler and Al-P.

History
In the 15â€“21 June 2006 edition of The Stranger, Keeler explains the origin of the album's title: "My girlfriend and I were watching American Idol, and judge Randy critiqued this one girl as having 'the looks' but not the talent. So we laughed at this intangible thing 'the looks' that can be good or bad, and later it became [our] album title. Because if you think about it, it doesn't mean anything, especially in terms of our album."

The earliest version of the track "Paris" was composed on a laptop, on a plane taking Keeler and Al-P back home after a trip in Paris. "Easy Love" and "Paris" were made available on the band's MySpace account before the album's release.

The cover art was designed by Seripop and won the Juno award for Best CD/DVD Cover Design of the Year in 2007.
