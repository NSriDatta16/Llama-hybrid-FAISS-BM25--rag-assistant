6th of October ( ;  ) is a city in the Giza Governorate of Egypt. It is a satellite city, located adjacent to Giza, and is part of the Greater Cairo region. Per the 2017 national census, it had a population of 450,000 people.

The city served as the capital of the now-defunct 6th of October Governorate, which was dissolved in 2011. Established as a new city in the desert, it hosts many local students, as well as foreign students from the Persian Gulf Arab states, Jordan, Nigeria, Cameroon, Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian territories. The city is named for the day that the 1973 Arab–Israeli War broke out.

History
The settlement was established in 1979 by the 504th presidential decree of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. It is 32 km (20 mi) from the center of Cairo and 17 km (11 mi) from the great pyramids of Giza. Despite having many unfinished or vacant buildings, the city has a total area of 482 km² (119,200 acres) and is eventually expected to have 6 million residents.

It was announced as the capital of the 6th of October Governorate in April 2008. Following the governorate's dissolution in April 2011, in the wake of the Egyptian revolution, it was reincorporated into the Giza Governorate, to which it had originally belonged.

The city's name commemorates the commencement of the 1973 Arab–Israeli War on 6 October, 1973, the same date chosen as Egypt's Armed Forces Day.

Climate
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh). Its climate is very similar to Giza and Cairo, owing to its proximity to them. thats being said, some places in 6th of October is a bit colder and windier than central Cairo and Giza city at night for several reasons. This is mainly because buildings as infrastructure tend to be more spaced out accompanied by more empty spaces allows for wind to pick for easily than the densely populated centre of Giza and Cairo. Additionally, the city was built in the desert which tends to be colder and dryer than the damp humid area closer to the 
Nile.
