The carrot cake is a cocktail that is said to taste like carrot cake, although it does not contain any carrot cake ingredients.  It is a shooter drink composed of one third Bailey's Irish Cream, one third Hot Damn Cinnamon Schnapps and one third Frangelico. Alternate Recipe: 1/3 Bailey's Irish Cream, 1/3 Butterscotch Schnapps, and 1/3 Goldschlager.

Ingredient needed 

 2 shots cakes or vanilla vodka 3 ounces 
 2 shot coffee liquor, for example Khalúa 3 ounces 
 1 shot butterscotch schnapps 1.5 ounces
 1 shot Irish cream, for example Bailey 1.5 ounces 
 ¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon
 2 shot of half and half
 Carrot ribbon for deco (optional)

Procedures 

 Start by preparing the glasses for the cocktail. Rim two high ball glasses with cream cheese frosting and pecans, fill them with ice, and set them aside.
 In a martini shaker, combine vodka, coffee liquor, butterscotch schnapps, Irish cream, cinnamon, and 2 shots of half and half. Put the top on the shaker, and shake the mixture until it's well blended. Taste the cocktail, and add more half and half if desired. Shake again, if needed.
 Evenly strain the cocktail into the prepared glasses. For a touch of visual appeal, garnish the cocktails with carrot ribbons and ground cinnamon.
 Serve the cocktail immediately
