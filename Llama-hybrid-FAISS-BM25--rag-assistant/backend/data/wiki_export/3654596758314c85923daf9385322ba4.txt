Ian Graham Tracey DL  (born 27 May 1955) is an English organist and choirmaster who has served as Organist of Liverpool Cathedral since 1980.

Studies and career
Tracey, who was born in Liverpool in 1955, initially studied the organ under the then Organist of Liverpool Cathedral, Noel Rawsthorne.  He subsequently continued his studies at Trinity College, London, before gaining further experience in Paris under André Isoir and Jean Langlais.  In 1980, he succeeded Noel Rawsthorne and, in doing so, became the youngest cathedral organist in the United Kingdom at that time.  He was later appointed Master of the Choristers, in addition to the position of organist, at Liverpool Cathedral.

In 2008, he relinquished the position of Master of the Choristers at Liverpool Cathedral to take up the role of Cathedral Organist (formerly known as Organist Titulaire); a role that gives him overall responsibility for the organs and recitals there, whilst affording him time for teaching, recording, writing and lecturing.

In addition to his Cathedral duties, Ian Tracey is also Organist (since 1986) to the City of Liverpool at St. George’s Hall, Chorus Master (since 1985) to the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society, Guest Music Director (since 1991) for the BBC's Daily Service, Professor, Fellow and Organist (since 1988) at Liverpool John Moores University and a past President (2001–2003) of the Incorporated Association of Organists. Since 2011, he has been Tonal Director for Makin Organs & Copeman Hart & Company Ltd.

Ian Tracey is in demand as an organ recitalist in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States, and has made a number of recordings, both solo and with orchestra.

In July 2006, he was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Music (honoris causa) in the University of Liverpool.  This honorary doctorate was awarded for "his contribution to music". In 2015 he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Merseyside.
