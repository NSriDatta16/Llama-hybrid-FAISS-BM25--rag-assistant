Rimma Mikhailovna Zhukova (, 14 March 1925, Tyumen – 5 August 1999, Moscow) was a Soviet speed skater.

Rimma Zhukova competed for the Soviet Union and after having become Soviet Allround Champion three times and having won the prestigious Kirov prize four times, she became World Allround Champion in 1955. Zhukova was one of the Soviet women who dominated skating for almost 20 years starting in 1948. Since all three medals at every one of the twelve World Championships between 1953 and 1964 were won by Soviet women, the strongest competition Zhukova experienced came from other Soviet skaters.
