Fire & Skill: The Songs of the Jam is a compilation album of hit songs written by The Jam. Each track on the album was performed by a different artist or band.

Buffalo Tom singer/guitarist Bill Janovitz was surprised to have the chance to do "Going Underground", saying that his band usually had to be content with doing also-ran songs on compilations such as this. Janovitz said he felt that playing the song in his band's usual style would have sounded too much like The Jam, so he and his bandmates reinterpreted it in a slower, less manic style. Janovitz added that this was the first time his band had experimented with loops.

A double A-side single of "Going Underground" and "Carnation" was released in 1999.
