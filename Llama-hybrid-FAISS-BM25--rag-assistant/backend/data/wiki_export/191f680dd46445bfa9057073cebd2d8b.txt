Doug Barwick (born 6 February 1962) is a former Australian rules footballer who represented Fitzroy and Collingwood in the Australian Football League.

Recruited from East Launceston, Barwick made his debut in Round 1 of the 1984 VFL season against Geelong at Kardinia Park. A strong mark and a long kick for his size, Barwick was a tough half-forward who was a handy goalkicker. He played 76 games for Fitzroy before moving to Collingwood in 1988. Barwick played in the Magpies' 1990 drought-breaking premiership, kicking two goals. He retired in 1991 at the age of 29, with 147 games and 217 goals to his name, along with a premiership medallion. He also represented Victoria in 1987 and Tasmania in 1990 and 1991.

He was named a life member of the Collingwood in 2010.
