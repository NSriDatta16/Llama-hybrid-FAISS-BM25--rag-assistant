Sir Charles Raymond Beazley (3 April 1868 – 1 February 1955) was a British historian. He was Professor of History at the University of Birmingham from 1909 to 1933.

Born in Blackheath, he was the son of Rev. Joseph and Louisa Beazley. He was educated at St Paul's School, King's College London and Balliol College, Oxford. His academic career was as a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, until his chair at Birmingham.

Associated with a pro-German tendency within the British political and intellectual establishment in the inter-war years, Beazley was a regular contributor to the Anglo-German Review, established in 1936. He subsequently sat on the National Council of the Link, a pro-German organisation.
