Caruso St John is a London-based architectural firm established in 1990 by Adam Caruso and Peter St John.

Practice 

Caruso St John gained international recognition for its designs of public spaces. The practice came to public attention with The New Art Gallery Walsall, a commission won in an international competition in 1995. From these origins in the visual arts, the firm now works on a broad range of public and private projects.

Clients 
Current and past clients include Tate Britain, the V&A, English Heritage and the Arts Council of England, as well as European housing developers Trudo, the SBB (Swiss National Railways), and the Gagosian Gallery. Caruso St John aims to have a wide range of work at a variety of scales and wants to resist the trend of increased size and specialisation that dominates contemporary architecture.
