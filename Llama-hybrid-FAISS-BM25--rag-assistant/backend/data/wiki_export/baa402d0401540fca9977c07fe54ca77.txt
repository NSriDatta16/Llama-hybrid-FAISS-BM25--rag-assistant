Ftan is a former municipality in the district of Inn in the Swiss canton of Graubünden.  On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of Ardez, Guarda, Tarasp, Ftan and Sent merged into the municipality of Scuol.

History

Ftan is first mentioned in 1150 as Vetane. In the 12th century, the lords of Tarasp owned land in Ftan and made donations to the Müstair and Scuol monasteries. As a parish, Ftan is first documented in 1492. Around 1542, it became Protestant. In 1499, and again in 1622, Ftan was destroyed by Austrian troops. In 1652, the village finally bought its freedom from Austria.

From the 16th to the 19th century, Ftan was repeatedly devastated by avalanches and village fires (the last fire was in 1885). In 1875, the first avalanche barriers were erected and afforestation began. Between 1860 and 1862, a road was built along the bottom of the Engadin valley; since then there has been very little road traffic on the hillside of Ftan. The station of the Rhaetian Railway (opened 1913) is also far below the village.

Until the middle of the 20th century, the inhabitants of Ftan lived from arable farming. Only in the 1950s did the transition to livestock farming take place. In 1970, the first ski lifts were opened; after that, winter tourism increased rapidly and numerous holiday apartments were built.
