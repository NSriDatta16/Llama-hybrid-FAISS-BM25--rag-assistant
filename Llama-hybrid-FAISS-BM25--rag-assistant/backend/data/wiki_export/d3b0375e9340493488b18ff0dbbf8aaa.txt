was one of the adult video game brands of Japanese company I-One Co., Ltd. based in Yokohama. It is notable for developing eroge video games with 3D graphics. After launching as a new brand of Heart Electronics Industry in 1992, I-One Co., Ltd. was established in 1996 . Interheart Co., Ltd. is an independent manufacturer from Heart Electronics Industry. The brand name is derived from the meaning of “visual entertainment”.

Initially, the company focused on creating general adult games. Things changed with the release of the first 3D graphics game,  , and  featuring heavy 3D graphics characters and backgrounds on February 14. Following works after INTERACT PLAY VR released on August 24, 2001, the company shifted its main focus to producing real-time 3D graphics games, and later have become well-known for the products.

The products are also known for characters customization and operation following a great hit of a virtual reality game  released in February 2017. In July of the same year, a hackathon related to VR Kanojo was held, and the establishment of "ILLUSION VR" (later IVR), a brand that mainly handles VR content, was announced.

There were many sister brands such as Illusion Core, Illusion Pro, Vision, MOTION, Dreams, mixwill soft, TEATIME, and FULLTIME, but currently only Illusion and IVR are active. TEATIME and FULLTIME are linked as sister brands on the top page of the official website.

Originally, in response to the controversy of RapeLay, the products were not allowed to be sold or used outside Japan, and official support was only given in Japanese and for use in Japan.

However, with the release of Honey Select Unlimited in coordination with the online English erotic game storefront FAKKU, Illusion's policy has since changed. Prior to this change in policy, they were often translated and released in English and other languages by fans.

Illusion announced its closure on July 14, 2023. All development and sales will cease on August 18, 2023.

On August 4, 2023, a new company Illgames (stylized in all caps) announced their new game Honey Come. Some players speculate about the relationship between Illusion and Illgames for the similarity of their products.  Illusion stated that there will be no successor company on August 18.
