 February 4 – Gambino associate and former DeMeo Crew member Richard DiNome is shot to death in his living room by an automatic weapon. Two other individuals with no known organized crime ties who happened to be at his residence at the time were also murdered. Authorities suspect members of the DeMeo Crew murdered DiNome to prevent him from becoming a cooperating witness for the government, but no evidence links them to the crime and the case remains unsolved.
 February 7 – The entire hierarchy and top members of the Kansas City crime syndicate are indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by a federal grand jury in Kansas City, Missouri. Charges against the crime family include conspiracy to murder Carl Spero in 1978 as well as skimming operations from the Argent Corporation, the Tropicana casino, and various Kansas City bingo halls.

 April – Cesare Bonventre, then the youngest capo in the Bonanno crime family is murdered. Bonanno underboss and future successor to Phil Rastelli, Joe "Big Joey" Massino feared Bonventre's growing power and wealth and felt Bonventre might make a move to seize control of the family since Massino was on the lam from an indictment at the time.  Named in an indictment issued on April 9 charging Bonventre and others with involvement in the Pizza Connection case, Bonventre fails to appear, and is assumed to be hiding out to avoid arrest.  However, FBI agents discover human remains stuffed into three 60-gallon drums in an office building in Garfield, New Jersey on April 17.  By sometime in early May, the remains are positively identified via fingerprints as Beonventre's.  He apparently had about $1600 cash on him at the time of his murder, which was left untouched.

Balistrieri was later sentenced to 13 years imprisonment on May 29, and his sons received eight-year prison sentences and fined on July 30.
