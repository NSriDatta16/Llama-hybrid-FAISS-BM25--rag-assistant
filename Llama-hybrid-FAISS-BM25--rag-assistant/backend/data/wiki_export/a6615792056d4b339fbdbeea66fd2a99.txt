Féng () is a Chinese surname. It is 9th in the Song Dynasty Hundred Family Surname poem and is reported as the 31st most common Chinese last name in 2006. Unlike the less common Feng surname 鳳 ("phoenix" fourth tone) it is a rising second tone féng in modern Mandarin Chinese.

The character itself, is made up of the character for "Horse" with an ice radical consisting of two strokes to the left that is meant to suggest speed or galloping.

Historical roots 
The surname descended from the 15th son of King Wen of Zhou, Gao the Duke of Bi (畢公高), whose last name was Ji. During the Spring and Autumn period, an official of the Zheng kingdom, Feng Jian Zi was awarded the land of Feng (Henan province). The Jin kingdom besieged Feng and gave it to Wei Zhang Qing. Thus descendants of Wei Zhang Qing also have the last name of Feng.

The surname originates from the southeast of Chang'an in Shaanxi Province.
