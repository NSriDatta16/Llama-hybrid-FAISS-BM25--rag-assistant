Vermin Scum is an Annapolis, Maryland-based record label founded by Kenny Hill (b. 1965 - d. 2020) of the bands Spastic Rats and the Hated. The name was given to fit the theme of the label's first release, the Spastic Rats' "Rodentia."

Released recordings by bands such as Spastic Rats, the Hated, Moss Icon, and The Shit.  Later run by Tonie Joy of the band Moss Icon, who is sometimes cited (incorrectly) as the founder of the label; Currently not active.
