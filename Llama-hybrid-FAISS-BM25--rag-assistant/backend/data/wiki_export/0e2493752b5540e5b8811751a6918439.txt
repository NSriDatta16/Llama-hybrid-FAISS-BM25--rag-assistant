Norcross Brothers, Contractors and Builders was a nineteenth-century American construction company, especially noted for its work, mostly in stone, for the architectural firms of H.H. Richardson and McKim, Mead & White. The company was founded in 1864 by brothers James Atkinson Norcross (1831-1903) and Orlando Whitney Norcross (1839-1920). It won its first major contract in 1869, and is credited with having completed over 650 building projects.

History 
The Norcross brothers, James Atkinson (b. 24 March 1831) and Orlando Whitney (b. 26 October 1839), were born in Maine to Jesse Springer Norcross, proprietor of the Norcross Mills, and his wife, Margaret Ann Whitney. The brothers moved to Worcester, Massachusetts in 1868. Their pedigree descends from Philip Norcross and his wife, Sarah [Jackson], the brothers' paternal great - great grandparents, originally of Watertown, MA. 

Skilled construction carpenters, the brothers formed their own construction company in 1864, and three years later contracted to build the new Worcester high school. The architect of the school was a young, but soon to be famous, Henry Hobson Richardson, and from then on Norcross Brothers became Richardson's favorite contractor, ultimately building more than thirty of his designs, including three considered by many his best work: Trinity Church in Boston, Massachusetts; the Marshall Fields & Company building in Chicago, Illinois; and the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 

Following the death of Richardson, the brothers became the contractor for many of McKim, Mead & White's projects.  When MM&W opened a new office in New York City, in 1894, the Norcross Brothers had their own space within it. As had been the case with Richardson, much of the value of the Norcross Brothers to MM&W, and other architects derived from Orlando Norcross's engineering skill.  Though largely self-taught, he had developed the skills needed to solve the vast engineering problems brought to him by his clients. For example, the size of the dome at the Rhode Island Capitol was expanded very late in the design process, perhaps even after construction had begun, so that it would be larger than the one just completed by Cass Gilbert for the Minnesota Capitol.

Because of their need for stone, a primary building material of the time, was outpacing the supply the brothers eventually acquired their own stone quarries, first in Connecticut (Branford) (now on the National Register of Historic Places) and in Massachusetts, and later in Westchester County, New York and in Georgia.  They also established a factory in Worcester where they manufactured architectural building parts
