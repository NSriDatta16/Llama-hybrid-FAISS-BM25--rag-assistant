Hamden High School is a four-year high school for grades 9 through 12. It is located at 2040 Dixwell Avenue in Hamden, Connecticut. It is part of the Hamden Public School System and is the only public high school within the town of Hamden.

The school was built in 1935 and is still in operation today, although it has gone through numerous renovations. Most recent was the removal of previous additions along with part of the original building, and the addition of 3 additional wings, all of which are attached to the original front wing to form a square.  One of its most notable features is a golden cupola atop a clock tower, at the front of the building.  Below the clock tower sits a small circular window, with two draping plaster banners on the sides seeming to form the letter 'M,' and giving the building the nickname "the MOM building."

While most students come from the Hamden Middle School, many others come from private and magnet schools in the surrounding area.

Campus
Hamden High School's historic main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1994. The school's lobby is decorated with murals showing scenes from Hamden's history. The murals, which form a frieze around the upper perimeter of the lobby walls, were painted by Hamden artist Salvatore DeMaio, a Hamden artist who was awarded the Prix de Rome in 1930, and were completed in 1936.
