Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (diphosphate) ()  is an enzyme with systematic name diphosphate:oxaloacetate carboxy-lyase (transphosphorylating; phosphoenolpyruvate-forming). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

 diphosphate + oxaloacetate  phosphate + phosphoenolpyruvate + CO2

This enzyme also catalyses the reaction: 
phosphoenolpyruvate + GTP + CO2  pyruvate + GDP.

It is transcriptionally upregulated in the liver by glucagon.
