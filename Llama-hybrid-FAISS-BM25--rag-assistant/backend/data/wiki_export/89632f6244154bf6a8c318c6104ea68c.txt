IntelliCorp (IC) sold its assets including LiveCompare, LiveModel and LiveInterface to Tricentis in May 2019.

History
Founded in 1980, IC marketed an early expert system environment (Knowledge Engineering Environment â€“ KEE) for development and deployment of knowledge systems on the Lisp machines that had several advanced features, such as truth maintenance.  KEE used the backward-chaining method of Mycin which had been developed at Stanford. While moving KEE functionality to the PC, IC created one of the early object-oriented technologies for commercial programming development environments (LiveModel).

The company was also one of the UML Partners, a consortium which helped develop the standards for UML, the Unified Modeling Language.

In May 2019, IC completed the sale of its assets including LiveCompare, LiveModel and LiveInterface to Tricentis.
