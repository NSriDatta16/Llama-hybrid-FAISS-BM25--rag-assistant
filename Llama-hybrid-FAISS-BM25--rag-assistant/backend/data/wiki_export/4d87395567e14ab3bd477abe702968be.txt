History

Around 770 one of the first churches of Twente was built in Ootmarsum. In November 917, Radboud, bishop of Utrecht, died in Ootmarsum. Around 1000, Ootmarsum was one of the largest parishes in Twente.

Ootmarsum received city rights in 1325. The town was then converted into a fortress with ditches and earthworks. In the 16th century Ootmarsum was occupied by the Spanish during the Eighty Years War but in 1597 was captured by Maurice, Prince of Orange. A cannonball from the siege can be seen today still embedded in the church.

Ootmarsum was a separate municipality until 2001, when it became a part of Dinkelland, together with Denekamp and Weerselo.
