Baždarević began to play for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team in 1992 after Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence. However, the team was not recognised by FIFA until 1995 in part due to the Bosnian War. He made his official debut for them in a September 1996 FIFA World Cup qualification match away against Greece and has earned a total of 2 caps, scoring no goals. His second and final international was a month later against Croatia.

In December 2007, Baždarević became the manager of French side Grenoble where he arrived on recommendation of his mentor, Ivica Osim, who knew Grenoble's Japanese owners from working with them in J.League with JEF United Chiba. He rejected offers from top league clubs Le Mans and Nice to take over Grenoble. At the end of the 2007–08 Ligue 2 season, Grenoble, led by Baždarević, gained promotion to the Ligue 1, for the first time in their history. Under Baždarević, the club reached the French Cup semi-finals during the 2008–09 season.

On 13 December 2014, Baždarević was named head coach of the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team, beating Milovan Rajevac for the position. Among other candidates were Vahid Halilhodžić, Igor Štimac, and Felix Magath. He replaced Safet Sušić, who was sacked by N/FSBiH due to a run of poor results in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying having only taken two points in four matches. Bosnia and Herzegovina improved considerably under Baždarević and reached the play-off stage for Euro 2016, where they were unfortunately eliminated by the Republic of Ireland with a 3–1 aggregate score. In the aftermath, Miroslav "Ćiro" Blažević, former national team head coach and successful manager, blamed Baždarević for Bosnia's elimination against the Republic of Ireland.

On 9 November 2015, the Bosnian FA extended the contract with Baždarević till after the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier campaign. He won his first managerial trophy with Bosnia and Herzegovina after beating Japan 2–1 in the 2016 Kirin Cup final.

In popular culture
Baždarević's international career is remembered for his spitting on Turkish referee Yusuf Namoğlu during a qualifying match for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, against Norway, which was played in Sarajevo. Baždarević was banned from the 1990 FIFA World Cup for the incident. Yugoslavia reached the quarter-finals at the tournament.
Baždarević again missed a major tournament, this time the entire Yugoslav team was excluded from taking part in UEFA Euro 1992, having already qualified, because of UN sanctions due to the Yugoslav Wars. Denmark instead took their place and, ironically, won the 1992 championship. On 14 November 1990, Baždarević scored a goal against Denmark in Copenhagen during the qualification for the tournament.
During the early 1990s, a Yugoslav sketch comedy TV show, Top lista nadrealista, made Baždarević a popular figure, due to the spitting incident on the Turkish referee.
