Maharaja Ganga Singh developed a bagichi (garden) in Lalgarh, which houses temples dedicated to Shivaji, Balaji, and Santoshi Mata. Kanheyalal Jain constructed a six-bed hospital in the village. Adjacent to the village is a forest spanning 1000 bigha. An annual cattle fair is organized in the village, serving as the primary source of Nagauri variety bulls.
 
The village is home to approximately 1,500 families, with 300 families belonging to various castes such as Lakhotia, Lohia, Bang, Malani, Jhawar, Bajaj, Toshniwal, Swami, Bagada, Tawaniya, Ojha, Sarswat, and others.
