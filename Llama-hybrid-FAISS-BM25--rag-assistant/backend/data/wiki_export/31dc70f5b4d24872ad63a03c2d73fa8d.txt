"On My Own" is a solo from the 1980 musical Les Misérables for the part of Éponine. Beginning in the key of D major, modulating to Bb major, then ending in F major, this is the most important song for the role of Éponine. In the song, she expresses her unrequited love for her best friend, Marius, and how she dreams of being at his side but knows his love is for Cosette and not for her.

The solo did not exist in the original French show that opened in 1980. When the English version was written, the music for "On My Own" was adapted from the original French solo "L'Air de la Misère" which was sung by Fantine about her misery and suffering. In turn, Éponine's original French solo, "L'un Vers L'autre", was dropped in the English version. In the later 1991 Parisian version, the title was "Mon Histoire" (My story). However, "On My Own" has become one of the most famous songs in the musical, and Éponine one of its most popular characters.

The first actress to play Éponine (English version) on stage was Frances Ruffelle; her version of "On My Own" is preserved on both the Original London and Broadway cast albums.

It has appeared in many famous events outside of Les Misérables.
