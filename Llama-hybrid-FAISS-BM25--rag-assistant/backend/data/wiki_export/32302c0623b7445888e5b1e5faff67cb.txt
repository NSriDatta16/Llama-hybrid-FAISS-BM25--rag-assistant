The 1957 Moroccan Grand Prix (officially named the VI Grand Prix de Maroc) was a non-championship Formula One motor race held in 1957, with no points going towards the World Championship. It was held over 55 laps of the 7.651Â km Ain-Diab Circuit on 27 October 1957.

This race was won by French driver Jean Behra in a Maserati 250F winning by 30.1 seconds, from British driver Stuart Lewis-Evans in a Vanwall VW5 in second place, and another French driver Maurice Trintignant finishing third in a BRM P25.

The race coincided with an outbreak of Asian flu amongst the Grand Prix community which explains the absence of Stirling Moss and the lacklustre performance of Fangio.
