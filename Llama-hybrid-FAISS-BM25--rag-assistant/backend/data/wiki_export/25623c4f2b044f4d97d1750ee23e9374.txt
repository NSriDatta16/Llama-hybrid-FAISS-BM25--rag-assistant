Football career
He started his career at Mansfield Town signing as a trainee in July 1990 and had a successful four-year period at Mansfield.

While at Huddersfield, Gray tackled Bradford City striker Gordon Watson in February 1997, the sliding tackle broke Watson's leg in two places and left his career in tatters. Out injured for 16 months, Watson was never the same player. Watson successfully sued Gray for negligence and was awarded £50,000 in interim damages. as well as a latter £900,000, the bulk of which was to compensate for the loss of anticipated earnings.

Then he joined Tranmere Rovers in 2002 where he had a nightmare spell playing just 18 games in 16 months. He scored once during his spell at Tranmere; his goal being the winner against former club Huddersfield Town.

In November 2003, he joined Carlisle United where he had a successful spell, playing a major part in the Conference and League Two successes and captaining the club. He was released in May 2007.

Gray was signed for Workington in July 2008 but didn't play any competitive games after he picked up a knee injury. Gray left at the end of the season after which he retired from football.
