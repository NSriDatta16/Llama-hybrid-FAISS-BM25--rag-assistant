Thomas Scioli is an American comic book artist and writer best known for working in a style similar to Jack Kirby.

Biography
Scioli was born in Philadelphia and moved to Pittsburgh after studying at the University of Pittsburgh in the 1990s.

Scioli's epic sci-fi/fantasy series The Myth of 8-Opus won a 1999 Xeric Grant and attracted mild industry attention, earning him a small part illustrating the Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Comic Magazine miniseries (2001) and ultimately higher-profile projects at Image Comics: the miniseries Freedom Force (2005) and the super-sci-fi-opera epic Gødland (with writer Joe Casey).  Scioli has stated that Gødland is "the best thing out there right now" and that he can imagine staying with the book for the rest of his career.

Scioli has attracted some criticism for the similarity between his art and Jack Kirby's, but he is comfortable with his style:

In 2013, Scioli announced he was leaving comics, but in 2018, he produced Go Bots for IDW.

Scioli was raised in Philadelphia and resides in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Scioli hosts a pop-culture centric YouTube channel  called The Total Recall Show along with his friend/musician, Matt Zeoli.
