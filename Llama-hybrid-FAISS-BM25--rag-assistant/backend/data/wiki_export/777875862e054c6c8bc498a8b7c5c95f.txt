Burritos, Inspiration Point, Fork Balloon Sports, Cards in the Spokes, Automatic Biographies, Kites, Kung Fu, Trophies, Banana Peels We've Slipped On and Egg Shells We've Tippy Toed Over is the only full-length studio album by the American emo band Cap'n Jazz, released in 1995 on Man With Gun Records.  It is also referred to as the Shmap'n Shmazz LP.   For a long period of time, the record in its original form was completely out of print—only recently has it been reissued on Polyvinyl Records on cassette tape and digitally. There was also a reissue of the vinyl LP licensed by Tiny Superhero records in the UK.

The twelve tracks found on this album are also found on Analphabetapolothology – a double CD containing all of Cap'n Jazz's recorded material – released in 1998 by Jade Tree Records.

Reception
NME listed the album as one of "20 Emo Albums That Have Resolutely Stood The Test of Time". In Rolling Stones list of the 40 greatest emo albums of all time, the album came in 7th, with Suzy Exposito writing that the album was "a significant blueprint for dozens of emo and post-hardcore acts to follow." "Little League" appeared on a best-of emo songs list by Vulture.
