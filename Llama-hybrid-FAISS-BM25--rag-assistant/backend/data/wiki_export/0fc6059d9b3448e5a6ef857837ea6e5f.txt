Stop In the Name of Love is the ninth studio album by American singer La Toya Jackson. The album, which was recorded and mixed in Sweden, is a collection of dance-style well-known Motown covers, including The Supremes' "Stop! In the Name of Love" and "Baby Love", the Four Tops' "I Can't Help Myself", and The Jackson 5's "I'll Be There". The entire album was recorded in one hour.

The album's original cover featured an uncensored topless photo of Jackson from her Playboy shoot, although the album was re-issued with the photo cropped. The album was also later re-issued under the title Dance Collection. The album was digitally released in 2009 as The Motown Songbook. Only one single was released from the album: "I Can't Help Myself". It was made in Austria and only released in Germany.
