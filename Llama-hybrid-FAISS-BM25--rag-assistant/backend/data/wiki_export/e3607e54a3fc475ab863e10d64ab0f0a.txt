Snohomish High School (SHS) is a secondary school located in the Snohomish School District, in Snohomish, Washington, United States. SHS, built for 1200 students, contains 1,689 9th–12th graders (as of 2016–17).  The school serves primarily those students living north of the Snohomish River (nearby Glacier Peak High School, serving those students living south of the river).

History
Before SHS actually opened it was a courthouse with a small jail section underneath. SHS first opened in 1894 at the completion of the original A building.  The school underwent many remodels through the 1980s, including changes to the B building. These changes removed the last vestiges of 'old' Snohomish High School, making the building completely modern. Among the changes made to the B building were the removal of its decades-old fixed wooden bleachers and over-painting of many student-painted murals from the 1960s and earlier. There were also additions of music, science, and vocational buildings during this time. In an attempt to curb overcrowding, the C building was constructed and opened in 1999, adding ten more classrooms. As the school became more crowded, it received a grant to remodel the campus, tearing down the B building was a major change. Parts of B building have been incorporated into the schools newer buildings.

SHS is a member of the WESCO 3A division of Washington state, and has won several state championships in both boys’ and girls’ sports. Snohomish's biggest high school rivalry is against Glacier Peak High School.
