Professional career

Philadelphia Eagles
Berger was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the 1994 NFL Draft. He was also drafted in the first round of the 1994 CFL Draft by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.

Minnesota Vikings
Perhaps Berger's best seasons came as a member of the Minnesota Vikings in the late 1990s. He was most noted for his booming kickoffs, which often sailed into the end zone for touchbacks; afterwards, he would take a bite of a Snickers bar that he would keep in his spare shoe on the sideline.

Pittsburgh Steelers

Berger was signed by the Pittsburgh Steelers after an injury to punter Daniel Sepulveda to compete with signing Paul Ernster. Berger won the job as Ernster was released on August 30 during final cuts. After experiencing hamstring problems, Berger was released by the Steelers on November 5 and the team re-signed Ernster. Following three poor performances by Ernster, Berger was re-signed by the Steelers on November 24. Berger developed into a great tackling punter, as evidenced by his five tackles in the 2008 season. He had two key touchdown-saving tackles.

Berger won his first Super Bowl with the Steelers at Super Bowl XLIII in which he had three punts for a 46.3 yard average and one inside the 20 yard-line.

Denver Broncos
Berger signed with the Denver Broncos on October 26, 2009, after they waived Brett Kern.  He was released after the 2009 season.

Personal life
Berger owns a set of nightclubs and restaurants in his hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia. He appeared on Millionaire Matchmaker on March 12, 2013 and is now married to Bambi.
