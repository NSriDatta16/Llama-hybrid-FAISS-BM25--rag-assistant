Avenue Montaigne () is a street in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, France.

Origin of the name
Avenue Montaigne was originally called the Allée des Veuves (widows' alley) because women in mourning gathered there, but the street has changed much since those days of the early 18th century. The present name comes from Michel de Montaigne, a writer of the French Renaissance. In the 19th century, the street earned some renown for its sparkling and colourful Bal Mabille (Mabille Gardens) on Saturday nights.

Fashion

Avenue Montaigne boasts numerous stores specialising in high fashion, such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chanel, Fendi, Valentino, Ralph Lauren, Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Chloe, Giorgio Armani, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana, as well as jewellers like Bulgari and other upscale establishments such as the prestigious Plaza Athénée hotel.

By the 1980s, the avenue Montaigne was considered to be la grande dame of French streets for high fashion and accessories, and is now considered more important than rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré. Several established clothing designers set up here, particularly the LVMH (Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton) group. LVMH brought investment and international attention to the street, and its stable of top designers and firms, such as Céline, Louis Vuitton, Inès de la Fressange and formerly Christian Lacroix, own a substantial portfolio of the street's real estate.

In 2009, the Comité Montaigne presided over by Jean-Claude Cathalan launched a website with an interactive map.
