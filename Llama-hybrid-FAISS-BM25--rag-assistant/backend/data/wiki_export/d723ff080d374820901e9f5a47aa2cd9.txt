William Bailey 

William Bailey was a Georgian that came to Jefferson County in the 1820s. His acquisition of Leon County land began in 1850 with the tracts displayed. By 1860, Bailey still owned plantation property in Jefferson Co. on the Aucilla River.

The Union Bank building in Tallahassee was purchased in 1847 by William Bailey and Isaac Mitchell after it closed in 1843 due to the Panic of 1837, Second Seminole War, and unsound banking practices. William Bailey also served on the Tallahassee Railroad Board of Directors 1861–1865. William Bailey was also a general during the Civil War. He died in 1867.
