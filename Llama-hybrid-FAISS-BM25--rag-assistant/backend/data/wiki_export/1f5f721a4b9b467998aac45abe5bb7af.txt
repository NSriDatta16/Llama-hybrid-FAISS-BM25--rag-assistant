WRKC (88.5 FM) is a 1500 watt student-operated college radio station in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in northeastern Pennsylvania.  The station's signal is best heard within inner Luzerne County (Wilkes-Barre, Kingston, Swoyersville), but can also be listened-to in outer Luzerne County (Pittston, Nanticoke, Dallas). WRKC broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Format
Like many college radio stations, WRKC is run completely by students at King's College, except for the general manager. The station's radio format has a fair mixture of contemporary rock, indie rock, punk rock and other assorted genres. Students must play at least 40% of their music from rotation, but sometimes this rule is voided if the genre of a show is unique (i.e., a reggae show would not require rotation to be played since there is very little reggae in rotation). In 2010, a completely student written and performed radio noir show began broadcasting on the station, making it one of the only non-music programs available on the station. WRKC was formerly a mixed news, talk and music station but in the last fifteen years went to a complete radio format, save for the aforementioned radio noir show and the station's anchor program, the Radio Home Visitor, a news program that has read the day's local newspapers to the blind since 1974. While a mixed radio format, the station aired some well-known segments such as a student interview with the Ku Klux Klan.
The station is webcast. The station airs 24-hours a day on a 1500 watt signal, playing a jukebox of CDs when student DJs do not do shows. Earlier in its history, King's students hosted shows on the air 24 hours a day.

WRKC's News at 5 
WRKC's News at 5 was a student-run and produced award-winning newscast that aired Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 5 p.m. while the college is in session. WRKC also broadcasts emergency alerts through an Emergency Alert System (EAS) and provides special coverage of breaking news events. The News at 5 was typically 20 minutes long and contains campus news, local news from the Wilkes-Barre area, a music segment, a politics or business segment, a sports segment, and important college announcements. The News at 5 was anchored live by student anchors.
