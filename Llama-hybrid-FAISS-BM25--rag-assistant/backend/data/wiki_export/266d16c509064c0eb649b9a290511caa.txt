William Rennick Boone High School is a public high school in Orlando, Florida. Built in 1952, the school is one of twenty-two high schools in the Orange County Public Schools system.

Two new high schools, Orlando North and Orlando South, were built after World war II to take the place of Orlando High School (which was converted into what is now Howard Middle School). The last principal of Orlando High School, William R. Boone (1892-1952), died of a heart condition before the two new schools were opened in 1952, so the school board dedicated one of the high schools in his memory, then christened Orlando North as Edgewater High School after its surrounding community.

Campus
In the fall of 2005, Boone High School was rededicated, after an eight-year campus renovation process was completed. The renovation included a new media center.

Academics
For the school year 2007–2008, Boone received an "A" under the school rating system. For the 2008–2009 school year, BHS again received an A, making it the only "A" school in Orlando, and one of only two in Orange County. Boone offers several college-preparatory and technical education programs.  College bound students can participate in the Distinguished Scholars program and the Gifted program. Students seeking technical preparation can participate in programs such as drafting, early childhood education, and Tech Prep. Students can dual enroll with local community colleges and technical schools for courses specific to careers.

Academies

Magnet Programs
The school offers three magnet programs (see magnet schools), which attract students from all over Orange County. These programs (the Law Magnet, the Academy of Finance, and the Criminal Justice Academy) offer four years' worth of elective courses with an aim of preparing students for similar majors in college. All of these tracks have won awards from the county and state.

Other
Other (non-magnet) academies at Boone include the Creative Arts Academy, the Health-care Academy, and the Academy of Information Technology.

Advanced placement
Boone also offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Students of any year (freshman through senior) may take an AP course.

Thespian Troupe 1139 competes in local and state theater competitions. They won a total of seven "Best in Shows" as well as the "Critics Choice" acting award in this latest season at the Districts Level. In early 2009, the drama department formed an improvisation troupe, Deep Thoughts, which plays several shows a year to this day.

The Legend yearbook has received the Gold Crown from Columbia Scholastic Press Association for its 2006  and 2007 books. In 2010 Hi-lights (the school newspaper) received a Silver Crown. Both publications have been Pacemaker Finalists from National Scholastic Press Association.

Some of these bodies, like the Senior Class, Junior Class, Sophomore Class, Freshman Class, and their umbrella organization, the Student Government Association (SGA), seek to teach (by a combination of play and enculturation). Other campus groups give students a platform from which to engage in social or political activism.
