The Munster Schools Senior Cup or  Munster Senior Cup is the under-age rugby union competition for schools affiliated to the Munster Branch of the IRFU. The trophy is named after Garrett Fitzgerald former CBC coach, Munster coach and Munster CEO.

The inaugural Munster Schools Senior Cup took place in 1909 and, since then, Cork city's two all-boys schools have been to the fore as the only rugby playing schools in the city. Presentation Brothers College have won 31 titles, likewise Christian Brothers College have won 31 titles. Rockwell College (26) were once the team to beat in the competition, holding the record for most wins until the 1980s. However, Rockwell have only won the cup five times since. 

Limerick CBS (4) won Limerick's first trophies in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by Crescent College Comprehensive (12) which contributed three in the 1940s and 1950s, whilst St. Munchin's (5) won their first in 1968. Mungret College, merged into CCC in 1974, also took the trophy once in 1941. In addition Ardscoil Rís, and St. Enda's have all competed in finals. The most recent winners are PBC, who overcame a strong CBC team 24-0.  

The competition's final generally takes place every year around St. Patrick's day, and alternates between being played in Thomond Park or Musgrave Park, unless there are two teams from one city playing; in that case, the game shall take place in that city.

Standing
