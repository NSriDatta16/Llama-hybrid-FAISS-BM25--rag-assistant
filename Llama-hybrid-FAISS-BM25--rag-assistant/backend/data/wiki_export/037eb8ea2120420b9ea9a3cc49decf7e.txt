Robert Davidson (born 25 March 1986 in Rutherglen) is a Scottish footballer.

Davidson started his career at Rangers, and after progressing through the Ibrox side's youth ranks alongside Ross McCormack, he made his debut against Dunfermline on 16 May 2004 as part of an experimental team fielded by manager Alex McLeish at the end of the season. He made one other appearance, against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in a 1–1 draw in season 2004–05.

He was loaned to Boston United in England at the start of the 2006–07 season, returning to Rangers in January.
