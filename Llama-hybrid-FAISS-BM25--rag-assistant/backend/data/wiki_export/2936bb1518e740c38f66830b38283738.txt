Bichhoo () is a 2000 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film starring Bobby Deol and Rani Mukerji. Bichhoo is a remake of the 1994 English-language French action thriller film Léon: The Professional.

Synopsis
Jeeva (Bobby Deol) is from a struggling family. He falls in love with Kiran (Malaika Arora Khan). Due to their differences in social class, Kiran's father does not approve of their relationship. To punish Jeeva, Kiran's father frames his mother (Farida Jalal) and two sisters for prostitution and bribes the police into arresting them, which leads to the three of them committing suicide. Kiran also kills herself, ashamed of what her father has done. Jeeva seeks revenge by killing Kiran's father.

He later becomes one of India's most dangerous assassins. He lives in a small apartment next to the Bali family. The father (Ishrat ali) works for a corrupt police officer named Devraj Khatri (Ashish Vidyarthi), who works in the drug trade. Kiran Bali (Rani Mukherji) is the youngest daughter of the family and strongly dislikes them. She tries to befriend Jeeva many times, but he is too engrossed in his killing to have any time for her. One day, Kiran is in Jeeva's apartment delivering milk to him. Whilst she is there, Devraj Khatri comes to Bali's apartment and brutally kills them all — Kiran is the only one to survive as she was in Jeeva's apartment. Jeeva soon finds himself taking Kiran under his wing, and so he trains her in handling weapons to get revenge against the men who had brutally murdered her family.

Relationship to Léon: The Professional
Bichhoo is similar to the 1994 English-language French action thriller film Léon: The Professional, written and directed by Luc Besson. Léon: The Professional stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hitman; Gary Oldman as corrupt and unhinged DEA agent Norman Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is reluctantly taken in by Léon after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hitman his assignments. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the hitman's trade. A notable difference is that Mathilda is 12 years old and Kiran about 10 years older.
