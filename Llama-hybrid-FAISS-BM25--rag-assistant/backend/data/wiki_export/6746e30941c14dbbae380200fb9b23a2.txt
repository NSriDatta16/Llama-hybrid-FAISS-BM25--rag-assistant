Little Bear is a series of children's books written by Else Holmelund Minarik and primarily involving the interaction of Little Bear, an anthropomorphic cub, and Mother Bear, his mother.

This series of books went on to spawn a TV series, Little Bear, which culminated with a direct-to-video film entitled The Little Bear Movie. The series was animated by Canadian studio Nelvana and starred Kristin Fairlie as the voice of Little Bear.

The five original Little Bear books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak. In 2010, two years before her death, Minarik published a sixth book, Little Bear and the Marco Polo, which was illustrated by Dorothy Doubleday.
