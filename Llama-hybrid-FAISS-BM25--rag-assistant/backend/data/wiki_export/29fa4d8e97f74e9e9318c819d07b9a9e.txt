The Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus (; ) is the upper house of the parliament of Belarus.

The Council consists of 64 members, and the representation is based geographically, with most of the elected members come from civil society organizations, labour collectives and public associations in their jurisdiction. Each oblast (six) and the city of Minsk (the national capital) are represented by eight members, and an additional eight members are appointed to the council via presidential quota.

It was established after the Constitution of Belarus was amended in 1996 following a referendum, replacing the Supreme Council of Belarus.
