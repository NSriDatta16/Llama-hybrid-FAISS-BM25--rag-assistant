History
I. P. Pavlova station was opened on 9 May 1974, with the first section of Prague Metro, between Sokolovská and Kačerov.
 During construction of the station, the remains of a decorative sculpture of a Baroque bastion were found. This sculpture can now be seen next to the ticket office inside the station.

The station has an exit at one end of the platform, which had three escalators until reconstruction in the 1990s, when a fourth was introduced. In 2015, a lift was installed, enabling disabled access to the station from Legerova street. Construction of the new exit cost 64.7 million Czech koruna.
