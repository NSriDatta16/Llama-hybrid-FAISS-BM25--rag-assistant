Performing arts and music

Theater
Hempfield High School is renowned for its extensive theater program and its annual Dance Theatre production. Created by Pat Kautter (choreographed and directed by Cody Smith, until 2021, switching to Devon Groff), this is a completely original show which features over 100 students. Dance Theatre celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008. Hempfield's spring musical productions, under the direction of Alejandro Ramos and Cody Smith, are also known for their excellence. A spring musical is also performed annually.

The 1,300-seat Performing Arts Center was designed by The Ray Group Inc., a Lancaster-based architecture firm that specializes in schools and universities. The PAC opened in the fall of 1995 and was one of the most expensive high school stages in Pennsylvania at the time. Local dance companies and performance groups often rent it out.

Music
The Hempfield Black Knight Marching Band consists of over 100 members. The Symphonic Band is for grades 10-12. The Concert Band is a 50+ performance group which accepts all levels of musicians from all grades, and is designed for 9th graders to adapt them to the more challenging material and style that is played in this band. The 2012-2013 band was selected to perform at the PMEA All-State conference. The Jazz Band hosts a variety of shows during the year, and the Jazz Lab Band performs with the Jazz Band during the spring jazz concert. All of the bands at Hempfield are supervised by the department chair of music, Matt Ceresini.

Hempfield is also the home to several choral groups: Hempfield Singers, Bel Cantos, Concert Choir, and Chamber Singers. All are under the direction of Alejandro Ramos. Hempfield Singers is a high level choir which is open by audition. Bel Cantos is an all female-choir, also selected through audition. This group is not currently running, however.  Concert Choir is a larger group that is open to any student. The Hempfield Chamber Singers is an elite group which includes a small number of singers. The 2012-2013 group also performed at the state conference. The Chamber Singers perform the national anthem at many of Hempfield's home basketball games.

The Hempfield orchestras include Symphony Strings, an orchestra tailored to advanced musicians; and Concert Strings, a performing orchestra designed for underclassmen.

All orchestras, bands and choirs perform at either the holiday concert, the winter concert or a spring concert. Some groups have shows outside of the Hempfield music department, which change every year.
