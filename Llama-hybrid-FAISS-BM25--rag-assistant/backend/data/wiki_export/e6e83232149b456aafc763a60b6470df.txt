The high school serves students from the municipalities of Berkeley Township, Island Heights, Ocean Gate, Seaside Heights and Seaside Park.

History
Students from the six constituent municipalities had previously attended the Toms River Regional Schools, before the new district completed its school building that was constructed on a site covering  at a cost of $1,430,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The school opened in September 1956 as Central Regional Junior-Senior High School with students in grades 7-12 from the six constituent municipalities of Berkeley Township, Lacey Township, Island Heights, Ocean Gate, Seaside Park and Seaside Heights, along with students from Brick Township, who attended as part of a sending/receiving relationship. The formal dedication was deferred to late February 1957 due to construction delays.

In October 1973, the Lakehurst School District announced that its students would be shifted from Central Regional High School to the new Manchester Township High School, which opened in September 1976.

Students from Lacey Township had attended Central Regional as part of a sending/receiving relationship, which ended when Lacey Township High School opened in September 1981.

Controversy
A 14-year-old female student committed suicide in February 2023 after videos of her being physically attacked in a hallway of the school surfaced online. The student's father believes that public humiliation and continued online bullying after this event spurred his daughter to end her own life. Later that month, Superintendent Triantafillos Parlapanides resigned after it was revealed that he had disclosed private information about the student to a UK newspaper, blaming the student's family and marijuana for her suicide, while downplaying the role and prevalence of bullying. The father of the deceased has described Parlapanides as a "piece of shit."
