Availability

Continental programming
In 2004, ARY Digital divided its broadcasts in such a way, that each Continent had different programming at different times, to better facilitate the audience.
The Channels were split as follows:
ARY Digital Asia
ARY Digital UAE
ARY Digital UK
ARY Digital USA

ARY Digital Asia
This version of the Channel is free-to-air, as channels in the Indian subcontinent are usually free-to-air . Unlike other versions of the Channel, ARY Digital Asia, features a wider variety of Local Programmes mostly dramas and international shows. Many of which may include foreign programmes including Hollywood, Bollywood and Lollywood movies, Indian, American & British TV shows, for example Criminal Minds, 24, Criminal Minds: Beyond Boundaries, NCIS and Prison Break

ARY Digital UK
ARY Digital UK is also free to air. The programming includes ARY Digital's  Dramas and TV shows while also having some programs for ARY Digital UK viewers only. The channel was called ARY Family from December 2017- November 2020 due to copyright issues.

ARY Digital UAE
ARY Digital UAE is also free to air, but the programming is limited to Pakistani programmes only, this includes ARY Digital's exclusive Dramas and TV shows, this is because UAE's local Channels own the rights for British, American and English shows and Hollywood films. 
Indian, American & British programmes are also not broadcast on the UAE version, because Indian networks are available in UAE.

ARY Media Advisory Board
At the turn of events leading to the emergency in December 2007, Salman Iqbal, CEO of the network announced along with the ARY Digital network committee the establishment of a media advisory board, the purpose of which would be to assess the media coverage (be it news or other programmes) on the network. Saying that ARY Digital has been reporting without bias for a while but the recent events ushering the emergency rule and temporary closure of one of the biggest news network Geo TV, ARY Digital required a better unbiased coverage. He concluded that an array of government leaders could weigh the coverage presented by the network on the basis of its rationality and coverage so that the media portrayed by the network was in verse with the way Pakistan is supposed to be imaged. The board would have seats for 20 members, each focusing on different aspects of media would provide their views on how media should be portrayed.

Criticism
For a brief period in 2003, ARY Digital received criticism upon its airing of a prisoner's derogatory comments against the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC-3) and a video showing balded young girls behind bars begging for mercy. The contempt of court proceedings against the officials of the network were withdrawn after the judge accepted unconditional apologies.

Attempted take over of BOL Network and BOL News happened in August 2015 by ARY Digital Network CEO Salman Iqbal, who said that the decision was taken in view to provide career protection to media industry and its workers. The founder of ARY Group said that his media group would launch the transmission of the channel within three weeks. However this deal fell through and in September 2015 it was announced that ARY was not taking over BOL.
