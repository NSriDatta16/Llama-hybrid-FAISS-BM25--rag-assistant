Paul Gégauff (10 August 1922 – 24 December 1983) was a French screenwriter, actor, and director. He collaborated with director Claude Chabrol on 14 films. His screenplays include Plein Soleil, for which he and director René Clement received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America, Les Biches, This Man Must Die, and the autobiographical Une partie de plaisir.

His first marriage to actress Danièle Gégauff ended in divorce. They had a daughter, actress and singer Clémence Gégauff. Paul Gégauff died after being stabbed by his second wife, Coco Ducados, on Christmas Eve 1983.

Chabrol once said of Gégauff: "When I want cruelty, I go off and look for Gégauff. Paul is very good at gingering things up...He can make a character look absolutely ridiculous and hateful in two seconds flat."
