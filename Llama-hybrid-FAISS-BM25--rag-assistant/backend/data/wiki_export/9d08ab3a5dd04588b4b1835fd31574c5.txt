The traditional districts of Denmark differ from the country's administrative country subdivisions nowadays, as their existence and extent are usually not defined by law. The Danes will often refer to their traditional districts if asked where they come from, rather than the administrative unit which has been changed several times (last in 2007).

Some of these districts are nationally known, others more locally. Some of them may vary in their delimitations, while others are based on ancient hundreds and syssels with fixed borders. Dialect, folklore and local identity will or would often vary from one traditional district to another.

The lands of Denmark were the three major parts of the country until the 17th century.
