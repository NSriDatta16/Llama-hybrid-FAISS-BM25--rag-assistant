Indium(III) telluride (In2Te3) is a inorganic compound. A black solid, it is sometimes described as an intermetallic compound, because it has properties that are metal-like and salt like. It is a semiconductor that has attracted occasional interest for its thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications.  No applications have been implemented commercially however.

Preparation and reactions
A conventional route entails heating the elements in a seal-tube:

Indium(III) telluride reacts with strong acids to produce hydrogen telluride.
