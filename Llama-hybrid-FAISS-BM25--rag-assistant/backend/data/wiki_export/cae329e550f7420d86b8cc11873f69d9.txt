History
The school began in 1954 in the Reformed Presbyterian Church in Geelong before moving to the former Geelong Grammar School building in 1961. In 1999, the college purchased part of the Geelong Grammar Junior campus in Highton and moved to that location. RTC retains some infrastructure (including the main library holdings, administration, faculty offices and a student residence) at its former campus in Geelong.

RTC Melbourne Campus
RTC classes are held at the Melbourne campus in addition to online and live-streamed classes. A library is located on the Melbourne campus.

Notable alumni
The founding members of the band Sons of Korah attended RTC and formed the band while studying there.
