Cajano was then cast alongside his Casino co-star Robert De Niro in the hit comedy Analyze This. Pasquale Cajano was also a well known Italian radio personality for many years on the Italian Communications Network radio (www.icnradio.com).

On October 24, 2000, Cajano died of prostate cancer at the age of 79.
