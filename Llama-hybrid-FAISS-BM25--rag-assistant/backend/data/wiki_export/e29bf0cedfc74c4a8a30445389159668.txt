History 
In 1919, Dr. Franz Thomastik, a violin maker, and Otto Infeld, a civil engineer, decided to found a company. They started manufacturing steel strings.

Thomastik-Infeld's workshops were completely destroyed in World War Two.

In 1970, the Dominant strings were launched. In those years, the conventional gut string was challenged by perlon strings; Thomastik-Infeld offered this type of string, making the brand very popular for virtuosi across the world.

The company was run by Peter Infeld from 1994 until his death on April 15, 2009. He was 67 years old. The company is now run by Zdenka Infeld.

In 2019, Thomastik-Infeld celebrated its 100 year anniversary by launching https://www.stringtelligence.com/.

In 2021, the Dominant Pro strings were launched.

In 2023, the DYNAMO strings were launched. As part of the campaign, Thomastik-Infeld partnered with Tonic to launch a practice challenge for participants to win sets of the new strings.
