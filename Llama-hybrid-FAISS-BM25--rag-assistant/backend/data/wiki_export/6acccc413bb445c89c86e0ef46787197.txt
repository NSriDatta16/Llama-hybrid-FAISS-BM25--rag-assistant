The team
The Infants featured star hitter Pete Browning. Browning had defected to the Players' League from the American Association's Louisville Colonels, who had finished the 1889 season with a 27–111 win–loss record. Browning hit for a .373 batting average in 1890, leading the Players' League. He also led the league in doubles. At one point during the season, he was running the bases and broke up a no-hitter by pitcher Ad Gumbert in the ninth inning of a game. With two outs, Browning was on first base after being hit by a pitch. The batter hit a ground ball and Browning let the ball hit his foot, rendering himself out but crediting the batter with a hit under the rules of that era.
