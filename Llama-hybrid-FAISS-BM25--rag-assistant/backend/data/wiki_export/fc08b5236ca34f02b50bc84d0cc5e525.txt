Books
 Throw Your Tooth on the Roof: Tooth Traditions Around the World Illustrated by G. Brian Karas; Houghton Mifflin, 1998; Ages 4–8;  -- "It happens to everyone, everywhere, all over the world. 'Look! Look! My tooth fell out! My tooth fell out!' But what happens next? What in the world do you do with your tooth?" The answer depends on the traditions of your parents and grandparents and great-grandparents. Do you throw your tooth at the sun? Leave it for a mouse? Hide it by a bush? Put in under your pillow? or Feed it to a dog? As Redbook Magazine wrote, this book "... turns a seemingly ordinary custom into a window on the world."
This book has also been published in Japanese, Greek, Korean, and simplified Chinese.

 How Many Elephants? A Lift the Flap Counting Book illustrated by Barney Saltzberg; Candelwick Press, 2004; Ages 2–5; . -- How many elephants are in your closet? That's ridiculous! Elephants don't go into people's closets ... or do they? This, as it says on the back cover, is a "... seriously silly lift-the-flap counting book."
