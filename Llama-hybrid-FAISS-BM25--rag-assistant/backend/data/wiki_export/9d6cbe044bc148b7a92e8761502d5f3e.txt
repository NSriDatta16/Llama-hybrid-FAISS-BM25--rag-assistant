This is a list of films that were filmed in the U.S. state of Arizona. Arizona's diverse geography make it an ideal place for making films.  The deserts in the southern part of the state make it a prime location for westerns. Old Tucson Studios is a studio just west of Tucson where several film and television westerns were filmed, including 3:10 to Yuma (1957), Cimarron (1960), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), and Rio Bravo (1959).
