The Journal of Chemical Physics is a scientific journal published by the American Institute of Physics that carries research papers on chemical physics.  Two volumes, each of 24 issues, are published annually. It was established in 1933 when Journal of Physical Chemistry editors refused to publish theoretical works.

The editors have been:
2019–present: Tim Lian
2008–2018: Marsha I. Lester
2007–2008: Branka M. Ladanyi
1998–2007: Donald H. Levy
1983–1997: John C. Light
1960–1982: J. Willard Stout
1958–1959: Clyde A. Hutchison Jr.
1956–1957 (Acting): Joseph Edward Mayer
1953–1955: Clyde A. Hutchison Jr.
1942–1952: Joseph E. Mayer
1933–1941: Harold Urey

Highlights
According to the Web of Science database, as to 15 March 2018, a total of 132,435 articles have been published in the Journal of Chemical Physics.  The number of articles published per year was about 180 in the 1930s and decreased to about 120 during second world war. After the war the number of articles increased steadily, reaching about 1800 articles/year in 1970. The publishing rate remained fairly stable at this level until about 1990, when it climbed up again reaching a maximum of 2871 articles published in 2014. It has since decreased somewhat to 2300 articles/year in the period 2015–2017.

As to 15 March 2018 and according to Web of Science, the ten most cited articles published in the Journal of Chemical Physics are:

By the standards of chemical physics these are huge numbers of citations and all of these papers should be considered pivotal.
