Library

The University Library began operating fully in 1983. The first university librarian was hired in 1982, and the library's initial book collection consisted of 36,509 volumes, including 30,818 books and 5,691 government documents, as well as 369 journal titles. At the time the library opened, there were 24 employees, including 20 junior and 4 senior employees. In the early years of its existence, the library experienced a series of moves as it searched for appropriate office space. The library's first move was from a temporary office to a temporary administrative building, then it moved to a three-bedroom home, before finally relocating to the Emaudo campus in December 1982, which was its permanent location. The library was then relocated again in 1987 to the Ujemen Campus, which had a more welcoming academic atmosphere. In 1999, a three-story library facility was officially opened by the head of state, occupying 14,000 square meters. The library system currently consists of a main library and several outreach libraries and it is a hybrid library system which provides print and non-print information resources.
