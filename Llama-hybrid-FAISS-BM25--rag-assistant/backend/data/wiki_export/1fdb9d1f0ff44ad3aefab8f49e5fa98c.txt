Biography
John J. McCloy was born on January 3, 1876 in Brewster, NY to James McCloy and Sophia Beatty. John McCloy joined the Merchant Marine when he was 15 and enlisted in the United States Navy on March 7, 1898.  He served on the cruiser USS Columbia in the West Indies during the Spanish–American War.

McCloy was then posted to the cruiser USS Newark (C-1) which served in the Philippines in 1900 and then participated in the China Relief Expedition during the Boxer Rebellion.  He received his first Medal of Honor "for distinguished conduct in the presence of the enemy in battles of the 13th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd of June 1900, while with the relief expedition of the Allied Forces in China."

McCloy married Sarah Frances on August 17, 1905. They had one child together, John II, in 1909.

He was warranted as a boatswain on July 30, 1903 and was promoted to chief boatswain on July 30, 1909. His second Medal of Honor was awarded to him "for distinguished conduct in battle and extraordinary heroism; engagement of Vera Cruz, April 22, 1914." Following the United States' entry into World War I, he was commissioned an ensign on July 1, 1917.  He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on July 1, 1918.

Immediately after World War I, McCloy served as the first commander of the minesweeper  from January 1919 to November 1920. The most significant service of the Curlew during McCloy's command was clearing the mines of the North Sea mine barrage. For this work McCloy was decorated with the Navy Cross. He was permanently promoted to lieutenant on August 3, 1920.

McCloy served as the National Commander of the Legion of Valor from 1922 to 1923. In November 1923 he was assigned to command the minesweeper USS Lark (AM-23), based in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and he was later transferred to the destroyer tender USS Dobbin (AD-3). He retired from active duty as a lieutenant on October 15, 1928, and was promoted in retirement to lieutenant commander on February 23, 1942.

McCloy was a companion of the Naval Order of the United States and was active in both the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. He was a founding member of American Legion Post No. 1 in Leonia, New Jersey, the first American Legion post in the state. He was also a member of the Military Order of the Dragon.

McCloy died of an apparent heart attack on May 25, 1945, in his home in Leonia, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

On 21 April 1914, at the United States occupation of Veracruz, under orders from Captain William R. Rush, three steam launches led by McCloy sailed from Pier 4 along the waterfront; passing the Fiscal Warf, they veered inshore, bearing towards the Naval Academy, fired a volley to the Academy from their small one-inch guns at their bows, and hastily returned, under heavy fire. Having thus revealed their positions, the Academy's guns were put out of commission by the shooting accuracy of the 3-inch guns from the USS Prairie.<ref>The Landing at Veracruz:1914, Jack Sweetman, 1968, pp.78</ref>

A more detailed account:
For distinguished conduct in battle and extraordinary heroism, engagement of Vera Cruz, April 22 (sic: April 21 and 22), 1914:
On April 21, Chief Boatswain McCloy was in charge of three picket boats unloading men and supplies at a pier when his detachment came under fire from the nearby Mexican Naval Academy. To expose enemy positions, he took his boat [sic: three boats] away from the pier and directed fire at the building. His action drew retaliatory fire that allowed cruisers to locate and shell sniper positions, thus protecting the men on shore. McCloy was shot in the thigh but remained at his post for 48 hours (sic) until the brigade surgeon sent him to a hospital ship. His medal citation credited him with "distinguished conduct in battle and extraordinary heroism."
