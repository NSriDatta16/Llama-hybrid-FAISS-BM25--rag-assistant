Danny Chia Chee Wing (born 29 November 1972) is a Malaysian professional golfer.

Chia was the leading Malaysian amateur in the mid-1990s and turned professional in 1996. He plays on the Asian Tour, where he won the 2002 Taiwan Open. He was the first Malaysian to win on the Tour. He has also won several lower profile professional tournaments in Malaysia and elsewhere.

In 2002, Chia became the second Malaysian to play in The Open Championship (and the first from a mainstream Malaysian background; his predecessor Iain Steel has a Scottish father, and attended school in Scotland and college in the United States, and therefore has a much more traditional golfing pedigree). Chia represented Malaysia in the WGC-World Cup in 2001 and 2002.
