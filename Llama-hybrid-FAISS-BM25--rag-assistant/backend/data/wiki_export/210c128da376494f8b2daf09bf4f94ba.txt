Early life and education
Born at Bingley, Yorkshire, son of schoolmaster Albert Joseph David Walbank (1879-1967) and Clarice (1880-1965), née Fletcher, Walbank attended Bradford Grammar School and went on to study Classics at Peterhouse, Cambridge. His father was the son of a cobbler, but had left the family business on winning a scholarship and became a teacher.
