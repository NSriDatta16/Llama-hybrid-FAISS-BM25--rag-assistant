Controversies 

On 19 April 2018, fellow singer Meesha Shafi accused Ali Zafar of sexual harassment on Twitter. Ali Zafar categorically denied the allegation and said that he would take the matter to court. On 23 June 2018, Ali Zafar filed a 1 billion rupees defamation case against Shafi for slander under the Defamation Ordinance 2002, claiming that Shafi had caused "tremendous injury" to his "reputation, goodwill, livelihood" through "false, slanderous and defamatory" allegations, according to Geo News. The suit read: "As the defamatory statements are patently false, it can only be concluded that this malicious campaign has been launched against the plaintiff as part of a motivated conspiracy to tarnish the plaintiff's good image through making false accusations."

On 25 June 2018, Court issued "a permanent stay against Meesha Shafi until the final decision of the case", preventing her making further claims against Zafar. Meesha had filed a complaint to the provincial Ombudsperson under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act 2010, which was dismissed on 3 May 2018. Meesha filed an appeal against the order of the Ombudswoman to the Governor of Punjab who also dismissed her appeal, on the grounds that Meesha Shafi was not an employee at the time. On 10 April 2019, the court fined Meesha Shafi Rs. 10,000 over "non-appearance" of her lawyer.

On 29 April 2019, Shafi described how she had first tried to resolve her complaint privately with Zafar's representatives, but Zafar insisted she visit him. On 30 May 2019, nine eyewitnesses, including two women, denied Shafi's allegations of harassment. Kanza Muneer said in her statement that during the rehearsal, at which 11 people were present and videos were made, Zafar and Shafi maintained five to six feet distance from each other. On 11 October 2019, Lahore High Court dismissed Meesha Shafi's appeal.

In his testimony in court Ali Zafar said that he supports the #MeToo movement, which is aimed to end sexual harassment and abuse, but it had been "misused against him". Zafar claimed that it was actually Shafi's lawyer, a renowned women's rights activist who was the master mind behind the conspiracy. "Meesha Shafi's claim in her court testimony that the other women who came forward are unrelated is a complete lie. Our findings exposed that they were deeply interlinked much before the allegations. The common link seems to be Nighat Dad. They were all either working with or for her," Ali Zafar said in his testimony while presenting evidence.

On 6 July 2019, lawyer Hassan Niazi in his tweets alleged Shafi's lawyer, Nighat Dad's NGO deleted its audit report and had foreign funding.

Ali Zafar also filed a criminal case of cybercrime in the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and tweeted:

Ali Zafar claimed that a social media campaign was launched against him through fake accounts and allegations, proof of which he submitted in his complaint to the FIA Cyber Crime Department. Many such accounts and Facebook pages in support of Shafi were instantly deleted when Zafar highlighted them on social media.

On December 16, 2020, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Cyber Crime Wing found Meesha Shafi and 8 others guilty of running a defamatory drive on social media against Ali Zafar damaging his reputation.
In January 2021 the Supreme Court admitted Meesha Shafi’s plea against the dismissal of her appeal
