Manor Road railway station is a station in Merseyside, England that serves the towns of Hoylake and Meols. It is located on the West Kirby branch of the Wirral Line, part of the Merseyrail network.

History
The station was proposed in 1936 and opened on 15 May 1940 by the London Midland and Scottish Railway, after their electrification of the former Wirral Railway route from Birkenhead to West Kirby. This allowed for through trains to run between Liverpool and West Kirby.

Facilities
The station is fully staffed during opening hours and has CCTV cameras on the platform. Each platform has a sheltered seating area for passengers waiting for trains. There is a payphone, booking office and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. The station does not have a car park, but does have a secure cycle storage for 10 cycles. There is step-free access available only for the Liverpool-bound platform, for wheelchairs and prams.

Services
Trains run every 15 minutes (Monday to Saturday during the day) between West Kirby and Liverpool.  At other times, trains operate every 30 minutes. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs.
