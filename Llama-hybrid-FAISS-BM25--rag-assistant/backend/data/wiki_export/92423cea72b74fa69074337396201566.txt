Precious Little is an album by British blues musician Jeremy Spencer, who was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1967 to 1971. Released on 18 July 2006, this is his fourth official solo album (his first since 1979) and was released on the Bluestown Records label in Norway, though Bluestown Records later licensed it to Blind Pig Records. The album was recorded over five days in 2005 in a Norwegian studio during the Notodden Blues Festival.

Local musicians were used to back Spencer on all tracks, because he believed that "they have retained the 'purity' of the old blues in their playing". Most of the tracks were self-penned, with the addition of covers of songs by Elmore James and Slim Rhodes.

The album was produced by Kjetil Draugedalen and Gaute Fredriksen, and the executive producer was Jostein Forsberg. It was mixed at the Supermono Studio, Oslo, and was mastered by Audun Strype at Strype Audio, Oslo.
