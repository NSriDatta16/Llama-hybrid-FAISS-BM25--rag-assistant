Vegår is a lake in the municipality of Vegårshei in Agder county, Norway. The  lake is located about  north of the municipal center of Myra and about  east of the village of Åmli in the neighboring municipality of Åmli.

The three largest parts of the lake are named Vestfjorden, Nordfjorden, and Sørfjorden.  The deepest point of the lake, in the Nordfjorden area, reaches  below the surface of the water.  There are many small islands in the lake, the largest of which is Furøya.  The primary exit for the water in the lake is through the river Storelva which flows south through the village of Myra to Nesgrenda in Tvedestrand municipality before turning northeast and flowing into the sea at the Sandnesfjorden.

Vegår supports one of the country's most long-lived and stable beaver populations, as well as a fish fauna consisting of European perch, brown trout, Arctic char, and European eel.
