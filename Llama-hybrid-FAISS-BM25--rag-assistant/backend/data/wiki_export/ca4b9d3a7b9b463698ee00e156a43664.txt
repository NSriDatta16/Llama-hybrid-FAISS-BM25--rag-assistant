Lansingerland is a municipality in the western Netherlands, in the province of South Holland. It was formed on 1 January 2007, by the merger of the municipalities of Berkel en Rodenrijs, Bleiswijk and Bergschenhoek, collectively known as the "B-Triangle". The former municipality of Tempel, abolished in 1855, is also part of Lansingerland.

The name was chosen from a competition and derived from the name Lansingh, the height-of-land between the Delfland and Schieland Water Boards, which runs between the "3B-Triangle" villages. The choice of name is symbolic: the name of the border that formerly divided the area, now unites it. The "h" in Lansingh was dropped to ease spelling.

Lansingerland consists of the following communities:
Bergschenhoek
Berkel en Rodenrijs
Bleiswijk
Tempel (deserted)
De Rotte
Kruisweg
