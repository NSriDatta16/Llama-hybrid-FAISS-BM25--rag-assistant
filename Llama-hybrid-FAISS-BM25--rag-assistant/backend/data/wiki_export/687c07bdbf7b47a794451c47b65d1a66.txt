Doboș made his debut for the national team in 1993, and got 23 caps, the last in 1998. He and was in the squad for the 1998 World Cup and Euro 1996. After Euro 1996 he signed with AEK Athens FC in Greece. He scored one international goal, against Liechtenstein in 1997.

Managerial career 
Between 2002 and 2005, Dobos was the president of FCU Politehnica Timişoara, then known as Politehnica AEK – in honour of the Greek club where he spent the last years of his career.

Personal life 
On 31 August 2008, Dobos had a serious car accident, which left him in a coma. He recovered after about a day and was again able to communicate with his family. But he remained with loss of memory.
"I am feeling OK now, I am doing my treatment and resting. I haven't fully recovered yet though, I still have memory problems. If I know Lăcătuş? I know him just from what I saw on tape, but I do not recognize him. Only his name. I was also surprised when I learned that I was president of Poli Timișoara and Universitatea Cluj. I don't even remember that I've played football", said Anton Doboș in EVZ.
