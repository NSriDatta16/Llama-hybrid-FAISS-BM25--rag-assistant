Orebić  () is a port town and municipality in the Dubrovnik-Neretva county in Croatia. It is located on the Pelješac peninsula on the Dalmatian coast. Orebić is directly across a strait from the town of Korčula, located on the island of the same name. Ferries service the two towns frequently. Orebić is  from Dubrovnik.

It was named after the family who restored the castle inside the fortified settlement in 1586.In 1707, Emperor Joseph granted hereditary nobility to the Orebić family for their 70+ years of service in naval warfare and trade. The original Writ of Nobility is housed in the town's Maritime museum, with Croatian and Latin translations at the Franciscan Monastery. The document describes the sea captains' colorful exploits in defending the Austro-Hungarian empire, Italy, and Spain against France and the Ottoman Empire.  The family's role in the Dalmatian salt trade brought wealth and distinction to Dalmatia. During the 19th century, Orebić had 17 of the most important nautical captains in Austria-Hungary Empire.

Tourism

Tourism is one of the town's main sources of income, especially during the summer months. In the 1960s a large number of non-locals (mostly from larger cities in the then former Yugoslavia) built homes for their summer holidays. In subsequent years, tourists from other European countries have begun visiting, staying either in hotels or in the camp sites located around the town that also cater to camper vans. The town's main beach is at Trstenica. Many locals also rent out rooms or apartments during the high season.

The Franciscan monastery of Our Lady of Angels is a local attraction, along with the Mount of Saint Elijah (Croatian brdo Sv. Ilija) located behind the town which offers a view of the island of Korčula and the Adriatic Sea. There are many sign-posted hiking paths from Orebić and nearby villages that lead to the summit .

Historic sea captains' homes line the waterfront, illustrating the town's heritage. Due to the wealth and importance of the sea captains in Dalmatia, the houses were built on a grand scale and set behind large gardens. Most of the homes in the historic district are still owned by descendants of the sea captains families, even those who returned after many years in diaspora. During the 20th century, these families donated ethnographic artifacts, for display at the Maritime museum and museum at the Franciscan monastery house.
