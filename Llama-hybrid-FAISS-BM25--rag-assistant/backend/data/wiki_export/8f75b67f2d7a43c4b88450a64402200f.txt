History
The name Bundall is from the Aboriginal word for a species of prickly vine. The area was originally settled by British landowner Edmund Henry Price in 1862. He established the Bundall sugarcane plantation. The sugarcane was crushed at the Benowa sugar mill. Subsequently, the land was used for dairy farming, until it was developed for urban use.

Bundall Provisional School opened on 21 September 1885. It was renamed Benowa Provisional School in November 1900.  On 1 January 1909 it became Benowa State School.

In 1965 a group of Greek residents of the Gold Coast formed the Greek Orthodox Community of St Anna (Gold Coast and Districts) with the ambition of establishing a Greek Orthodox Church. In 1978, the first St Anna Greek Orthodox Church was built on land donated by Greek entrepreneur Peter Vaggelas to fulfill a pledge that his wife Betty had made to St Anna during the difficult birth of their daughter. The present St Anna's Church at 31A Crombie Avenue was built on land donated by Jim Raptis, President of the Greek Community.
