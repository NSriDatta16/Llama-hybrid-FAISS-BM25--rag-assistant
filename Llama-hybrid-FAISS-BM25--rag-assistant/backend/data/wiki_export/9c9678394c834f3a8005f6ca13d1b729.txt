Robert P. Dunn (August 28, 1890 â€“ March 24, 1937) was a comic actor who was one of the original Keystone Kops in Hoffmeyer's Legacy.

Early years 
Dunn was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Richard P. and Melissa Dunn, and attended St. Johns Military Academy. He was a world-champion high-diver with Dr. Carver's diving horses.

Career
Dunn started his film career at Keystone Studios with Mack Sennett and worked as a comedian and stuntman for a variety of other film studios as well. He lost many of his teeth and suffered other injuries performing stunts as well, including the loss of one of his eyes when he fell into a barrel of water and his eye was irreparably damaged by a floating matchstick. The glass eye he wore after that accident gave him a somewhat "cross-eyed" appearance, although that effect "served only to empower his comedic career." Later, during the 1920s and 1930s, he performed as a supporting player for many of the film industry's leading comedians, such as Harold Lloyd, W. C. Fields, Charley Chase, the Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy.

Death
Dunn died of a heart attack on March 24, 1937, in Hollywood, California, at the age of 46. His grave site is at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.
