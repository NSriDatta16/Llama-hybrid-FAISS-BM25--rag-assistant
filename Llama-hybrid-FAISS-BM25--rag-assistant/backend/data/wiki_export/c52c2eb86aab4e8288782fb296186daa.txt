Seiffert Oval served as the base of the Canberra Raiders for the first eight seasons of its existence (1982–1989).
The Raiders' first game at Seiffert was in Round 2 of the 1982 NSWRFL season against the Western Suburbs Magpies. In front of 6,769 fans, Wests ran out 33–4 winners, with the home side failing to score a try against their opponents' seven. Canberra's first win at the ground, which was also their first ever competition win, would come in Round 8 of the 1982 season when 9,982 fans saw the "Green Machine" run out 12–11 winners over the Newtown Jets.

The ground hosted an 'international' rugby league match during the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour when an Australian Prime Minister's XIII, including Raiders Gary Belcher, Peter Jackson, Glenn Lazarus and Mal Meninga defeated the tourists 24–16 on a wet day in front of 6,037 fans. It also hosted an international rugby union match when the British and Irish Lions defeated the ACTRU 41–25 in 1989.

The Canberra Raiders final premiership game at Seiffert Oval was on 20 August 1989.
