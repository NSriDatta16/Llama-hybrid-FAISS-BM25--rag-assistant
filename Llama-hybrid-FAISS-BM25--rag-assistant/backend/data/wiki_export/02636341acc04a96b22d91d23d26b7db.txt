The Romsdal Museum () is a museum in the Romsdal district of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.  The museum is based in Molde Municipality, but it has sites all over the region.

History 

The museum was founded by Peter Tønder Solemdal (1876-1963) in 1912, and is one of the largest and most extensive folk museums in Norway. In addition, the museum has a library and several archives for prints, text, and photographs. In 1928, the museum was opened to the public.

In the middle of the field is the old "Isdammen", previously used for ice production. The area also contains a lake, which is very popular with local birds, and a stage that is used during Moldejazz, the Molde International Jazz Festival. Several houses are included in a guided tour: Tresfjord Cottage, Holt Cottage, Hammervoll house, and Erik Pålgarden Garden.

Krona is the Romsdal Museum's new museum building. In addition to the art collection and archives of historical photographs, the building houses a permanent exhibition that tells about living conditions in the region through different times.
