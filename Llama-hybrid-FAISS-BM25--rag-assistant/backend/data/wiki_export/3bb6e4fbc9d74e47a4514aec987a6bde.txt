Bicycles & Tricycles is the sixth studio album by English electronic music group the Orb, released on 3 May 2004 by Cooking Vinyl. It brought together the group's style of the early 1990s with current electronic music, with its most prevalent influences being drum and bass and trip hop.

Bicycles & Tricycles received mixed reactions from critics. The Daily Telegraph praises it as being "inclusive, exploratory, and an enjoyable journey", but many other publications dismissed it as "stoner dub" and deemed it largely irrelevant to contemporary electronic music culture. NME scored the album a lowly 3/10, calling it "more of the same from an act who have been ploughing the same furrow for so long they'll be reaching the Earth's core soon".

To promote the album, the Orb began a UK tour with Mad Professor, who had remixed their work in the past. Though the Orb still pulled in large crowds, The Guardian described one London performance as "joyless" and stated that few of the new tracks "really go anywhere".
