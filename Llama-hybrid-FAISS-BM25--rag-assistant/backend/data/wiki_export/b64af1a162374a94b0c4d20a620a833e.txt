A Roman settlement was founded in the area of Pocking as early as the 1st century AD. The Bajuwaren tribe settled around Pocking in the 6th century AD. In 820 AD Pocking was first mentioned in a historic document.
Since 1824 Pocking forms its own political community and in 1971 it was granted the privileges of a town.

During the Nazi regime a side camp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp was set up in Pocking.
After World War II the second largest DP camp ("displaced persons") in Germany was located in Pocking. In 1946 the camp housed 7,645 people, mostly of Jewish heritage. It was disbanded in 1949.

The Rottal area to which Pocking belongs is famous for its horse breeding. That is also why the coat of arms of Pocking includes the head of a horse. The other symbols relate to the history of the town and the different villages that formed the political community of Pocking.
