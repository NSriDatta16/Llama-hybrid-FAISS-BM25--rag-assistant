13 is the second album by American heavy metal band Solace. Considered heavier, angrier and musically more aggressive than its predecessor Further, 13 continued to raise Solace above their stoner rock stereotype with its heavy metal and doom metal influences, this time with help from Scott "Wino" Weinrich (The Obsessed, Saint Vitus, Spirit Caravan). With comparisons made between 13 and albums from heavy bands Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, Solace was dubbed "one of the freshest sounds the metal scene has ever cultivated".

13 was released in 2003 on both CD and vinyl; the CD version contained 13 tracks, while the vinyl version featured two additional songs. The cover art was supplied by artist, fan and friend of Solace, Paul Vismara. It took Solace three years to complete the album.

Title
13'''s title was derived from the bad luck the band felt they endured during the production of this album. Problems included:
 The need for four different drummers to complete the album.
 Internal strife due to supposed splits with vocalist Jason.
 The destruction of the album's original master tapes prior to their completion.

The lyrics to the original songs on this album have never been officially released. It is commonly believed that their intensely personal nature prevents vocalist Jason from allowing their publication.

The song "Once Around the Sun (Deep Through Time)" has an introduction that features dialogue from the 1962 film The Creation of the Humanoids.
