Peter Joseph Babando (May 10, 1925 â€“ February 19, 2020) was an American-born Canadian ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League with all four of the United States-based Original Six teams (Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers).

The son of Italian immigrants, Babando was born in Braeburn-Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania. His family briefly moved back to Italy before settling in South Porcupine, Ontario, when he was a youngster.

Babando died on February 19, 2020, at the age of 94.

Career 
During six NHL seasons, Babando scored 86 goals, 73 assists (for 159 points) in 351 regular season games. On April 23, 1950, in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, he scored the Cup-clinching goal as a member of the Red Wings, to defeat the New York Rangers at 8:31 of the second overtime. As of 2022, it remains the only Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals to go multiple overtimes. At the time, he was one of the few American-born players in the NHL. The goal was the third and final Stanley Cup playoff goal in Babando's career.  About three months later, Babando was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks as part of a nine-player deal. Babando was also a member of the Clinton Comets of the Eastern Hockey League.
