Vinland Saga is the second full-length album by the symphonic metal band Leaves' Eyes, released in 2005. It is a concept album that tells the story of the voyage of the Norse explorer Leif Erikson and his discovery of Vinland (a.k.a. Newfoundland). The main vocals are by the Norwegian singer Liv Kristine, but some harsh vocals performed by her husband and producer Alexander Krull can be heard on the songs "Solemn Sea", "The Thorn", and "New Found Land".

A limited edition version of the album was released on 7 November 2006, which included two bonus tracks, a making-of video, an interview with Liv Kristine, as well as the music video produced for the single "Elegy" .
