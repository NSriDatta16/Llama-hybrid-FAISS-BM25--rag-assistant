Name
In modern French, the word deuil means mourning. That is  not, however, the derivation of this commune's name. The word is in fact Celtic, a combination of divo (God) and ialo (a clearing in a wood.) Historical citations include the toponyms Diogilum (862,) Doguillum, Diogilo (9th century,) and Villam Dueil (1070.)

Originally called simply Deuil in modern times, the name of the commune became officially Deuil-la-Barre on 7 December 1952. Barre here has the sense of a barrier or enclosure.

The demonym is Deuillois.
