Career

Early career

Born in Rafaela, Santa Fe Province, Porto started his racing career at age 11, competing in the mini-motorcycle local circuit.
His first international competition was the 125cc 1994 Argentine Grand Prix, and only two years later he won the 250cc European Championship.

The bulk of his racing career was in the 250cc World Championship, starting in 1996 with Aprilia. In 1999 he moved to Yamaha and finished in 9th place in his first two years at the team and in 5th place in the 2002 championship, winning the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro

He moved to the Repsol Aprilia team in 2004 and was championship runner-up, winning five Grands Prix and taking ten podium positions in total. In the 2005 season he claimed the Dutch TT at Assen and also finished second in the Australian Grand Prix, before the Repsol team moved to Honda bikes for 2006.

Rather than the expected switch to MotoGP after the 2006 season, he surprised everyone with the news of his retirement from motorcycle competition, claiming he had a hard time adjusting to the 250cc Honda bike, and that he was no longer enjoying his work. He returned to racing in late 2013.
