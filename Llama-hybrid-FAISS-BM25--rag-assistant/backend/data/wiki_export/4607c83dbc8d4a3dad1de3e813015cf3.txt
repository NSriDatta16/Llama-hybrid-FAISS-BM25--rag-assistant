The New England Adolescent Research Institute (NEARI) is a therapeutic educational organization operating in Easthampton, Massachusetts.  It was founded in 1984 by Steven Bengis and Penny Cuninggim to treat extremely challenged youth with learning disabilities, mental illness, and/or neurological disorders.  NEARI operates Chapter 766 special education day schools for high school, middle school, and older elementary school students.  NEARI no longer operates a training institute or a publishing company.

The publishing company had published works ranging from manuals for specialists in the field of sexual assault to survivor stories. All works are selected for publication based on their ability to educate the public.

Educational philosophy 
The NEARI day schools practice a "relationship-based" model of learning.  This model is a set of policies and principles that guide staff to form lasting relationships with their students.  Most of the details of this model are proprietary and can not be disclosed here.  One publicly acknowledged piece of this model is a low student-to-staff ratio.  NEARI operates on a ratio of about 3:1 or 2:1, depending on the program in question.  The drawback to this approach is the substantial financial load it places on the organization.

Brain-based treatment and education 
Since the year 2000, NEARI has been incorporating "brain-based" technology into its educational and therapeutic services.  Coordinated by Penny Cuninggim, this initiative combines specialized exercise with an awareness of learning styles and new practices for diagnosing and treating visual and auditory processing issues.

Facilities

Current facilities 
The NEARI day schools currently operate out of one building in Easthampton MA, the site of the former Tri County School.
