Sueños Líquidos (Spanish for Liquid Dreams) is the fifth studio album (ninth overall) recorded by Mexican rock band Maná, It was released by WEA Latina on October 14, 1997 (see 1997 in music). After its release for the first time in over 36 countries across the globe, the band began to receive wide international attention, especially in Spain and the U.S., where the album sold over one million copies. This album was born of the desire to create an environment where water, a vital element, has an important presence. Because of this, the record was recorded in the coastal city of Puerto Vallarta, an important location in the creative atlas of Maná. Sueños Líquidos garnered Maná its first Grammy Award, for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance. The album was given a Premio Lo Nuestro award for "Pop Album of the Year" which was shared with Shakira for "¿Dónde están los ladrones?.
It was released on DVD-Audio format in 2001. As of 2000, it sold 5 millions of copies.
