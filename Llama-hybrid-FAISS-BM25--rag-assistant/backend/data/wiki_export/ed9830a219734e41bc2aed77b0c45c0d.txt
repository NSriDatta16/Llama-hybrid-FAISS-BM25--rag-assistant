Maasai spirituality is the traditional beliefs of the Maasai people of Kenya and Tanzania.

Traditional beliefs 
In Maasai culture, nature and its elements are important facets of their religion. Enkai (also called Engai) is the androgynous Supreme Creator, possessing both masculine and feminine principles. The Maasai  refer to Ngai's primordial dwelling as "Ol Doinyo Lengai" which literally means "The Mountain of God" , which they believe is in Northern Tanzania.

Ngai or Enkai's name is synonymous to "rain."

In Maasai religion, the Laibon (plural: Laiboni) intercedes between the world of the living and the Creator.  They are the Maasai's high priests and diviners.  In addition to organizing and presiding over religious ceremonies—including sacrifice and libation, they also heal the living, physically and spiritually.
