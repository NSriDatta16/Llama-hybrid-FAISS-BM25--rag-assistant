Alexandertorte, also known as Alexander Torte or Aleksander Torte (, Aleksandra torte), is a dessert that was conceived to commemorate a visit of Tsar Alexander III in Riga, today's capital of Latvia.

Consisting of pastry strips filled with raspberry preserves or raspberry jam, it is traditionally eaten as a lunch or dinner dessert, but it can also be served at tea time. It should be made a day or so before it is planned to serve, because the icing must be hard before the torte is cut.

A similar dessert exists in Denmark, and is known as hindb√¶rsnitte. In the German language area, a torte of the same name exists that has almonds and wineberries as the main ingredients.

A Finnish version of the dessert called  commemorates Tsar Alexander I of Russia and has been produced since 1818.
