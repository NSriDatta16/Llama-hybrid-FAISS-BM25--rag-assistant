Mellow Dubmarine is a double album featuring reggae covers of various Beatles songs. A handful of Wings, Paul McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison solo tracks are also featured. The tracks compiled were apparently recorded between the late 1960s and 2000. Several songs are covered by more than one artist – for example, there are three versions of "Let It Be". The album is hard to find in stores.
