"Flawless" is the second single from Phife Dawg's debut album Ventilation: Da LP.

Background
The song is mainly a diss track about Phife's disputes with Jive Records, former bandmate Q-Tip (due to his newly adopted style in rap and appearance), and at the music industry in general. The music video shows Phife performing in front of a crowd and riding around. Also he is filming the video while the director makes absurd decisions.
