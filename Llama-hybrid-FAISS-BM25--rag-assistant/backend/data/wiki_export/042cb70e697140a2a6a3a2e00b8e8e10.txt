Corduroy is an animated children's television series based on Don Freeman's 1968 children's book Corduroy and its 1978 follow-up A Pocket for Corduroy. It originally aired for one season on TVOKids in Canada and PBS Kids' Bookworm Bunch in the U.S. in 2000. After the final episode, repeats were aired until October 28, 2001, when it was cancelled along with Elliot Moose. The show consists of 26 10-minute stories, which were broadcast in pairs as 13 21-minute episodes.

Overview
The story is set in New York, USA, and follows the teddy bear Corduroy (whose personality is similar to a preschool child) and his best friend Lisa, a young schoolgirl of Jamaican heritage. Lisa lived with her mother in an unnamed big city. Corduroy's toy friends are: Buckaroo the rocking horse and Rosetta the wind-up mouse (whose personalities—like Corduroy—are also similar to a preschool child).
