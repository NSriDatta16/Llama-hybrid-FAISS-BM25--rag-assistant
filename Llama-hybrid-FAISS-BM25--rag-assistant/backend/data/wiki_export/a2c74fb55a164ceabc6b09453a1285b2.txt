Music clip
The film clip for "Arithmetic" features Fraser in a dimly lit studio surrounded by fairy lights and with fairy lights all over her piano. As the song only features piano and a string quartet, the quartet is also visible in another part of the studio with their music stands also lit by fairy lights. For this abundance of fairy lights, "Arithmetic" was awarded the satirical award for "Most used fairy lights in a video clip" in the 2004 Studio 2 Awards.
