Monsignor Basil Shereghy (1918 – 1988) was a leading Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church priest and professor, as well as a cultural activist for Rusyns in the United States.

He was born in Dorobratovo, Austria-Hungary (historic Czechoslovakia (1918–1939), Hungary (1939–45), now Ukraine). Ordained in 1942 in the Eparchy of Mukachevo, he taught in the Greek Catholic seminary in Uzhorod during World War II.

In 1946 he emigrated to the US, serving for the rest of his life in the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh. He worked as a professor of language and liturgy at the Byzantine Catholic Seminary of SS. Cyril and Methodius in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also was a longtime editor (1970–1986) of the diocesan newspaper Byzantine Catholic World, which he co-founded.
