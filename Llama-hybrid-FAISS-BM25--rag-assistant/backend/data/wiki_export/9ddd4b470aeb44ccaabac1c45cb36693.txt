Life
Morton Norton Cohen was born on 27 February 1921 in Calgary, Alberta. His family moved to Montreal, Quebec, and then to Revere, Massachusetts. He taught English at West Virginia University, Syracuse University, Rutgers University and the City College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. In addition to his  work on Charles Dodgson, he  produced studies of Henry Rider Haggard, Rudyard Kipling and other Victorian subjects, as well as children's literature, travel articles and fiction. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1996. The Modern Language Association set up the biennial Morton N. Cohen Award for a Distinguished Edition of Letters in 1989. The first award was given in 1991. Under the terms of the award, the "winning collection will be one that provides readers with a clear, accurate, and readable text; necessary background information; and succinct and eloquent introductory material and annotations. The edited collection should be in itself a work of literature."

Cohen died on 12 June 2017 in Manhattan, New York.
