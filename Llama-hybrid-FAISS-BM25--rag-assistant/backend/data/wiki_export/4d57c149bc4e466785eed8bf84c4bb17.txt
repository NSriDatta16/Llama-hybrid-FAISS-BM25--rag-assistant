ZTreeWin, an orthodox file manager for Microsoft Windows, is a (heavily improved) clone of XTree. Like XTree, it logs (preloads) filenames and attributes into memory so that search and sort operations are extremely fast. By making use of the large memories of modern computers it allows the logging of millions of files.

ZTreeWin makes use of Win32 consoles. It is primarily key-driven, but it also supports the use of the mouse.

The ZAAP architecture is available which supports the integration of add-in applications.
