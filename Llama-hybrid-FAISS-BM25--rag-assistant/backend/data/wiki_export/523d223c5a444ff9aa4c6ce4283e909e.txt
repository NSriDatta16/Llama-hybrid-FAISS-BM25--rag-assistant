Gameplay

The game, which features two-dimensional movement through a cartoonish three-dimensional environment, is loosely based on the 1844 Alexandre Dumas, p√®re classic The Three Musketeers. It is the first video game to use this novel as its source material. In the game, the player controls Porthos in an attempt to save his kidnapped companions.

Reception

The game was nominated for a 2006 Swedish Game Award in the category Family Game of the Year. In contrast, the UK Official Nintendo Magazine gave the WiiWare version 20%, saying,"There are hundreds of games that are worth your money more than this hopelessly generic, lazily conceived side-scroller". Thus, it currently stands as the lowest score that the magazine has given to a WiiWare game.
