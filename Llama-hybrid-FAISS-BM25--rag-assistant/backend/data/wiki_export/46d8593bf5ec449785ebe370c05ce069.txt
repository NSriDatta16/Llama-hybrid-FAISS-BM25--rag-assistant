The Pritzker School of Medicine is the M.D.-granting unit of the Biological Sciences Division of the University of Chicago. It is located on the university's main campus in the historic Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago and matriculated its first class in 1927. The medical school offers a full-time Doctor of Medicine degree program, joint degree programs, graduate medical education, and continuing medical education.

History 
Interest in opening a medical school at the University of Chicago began in 1898 when the university became affiliated with Rush Medical College while Chicago endeavored to establish funds for the construction of a medical school. The affiliation with Rush Medical College continued until 1942. In 1916, the university's Board of Trustees set aside $5.3 million for its development, but World War I delayed its construction until 1921. With construction complete in 1927, the school matriculated its first class of medical students. Following a $16 million gift from the Pritzker family of Chicago (founders of the Hyatt hotel group) to the University of Chicago, the School of Medicine was renamed in their honor in 1968.

Pritzker was the first medical school to hold the now international tradition of the white coat ceremony in 1989, which celebrates the students' transition and commitment to a lifelong career as a physician.

For the entering Class of 2016–2017, 5,640 people applied and 719 interviewed for 88 spots in the class. Accepted applicants had a median GPA of 3.88 and median MCAT score of 520.
