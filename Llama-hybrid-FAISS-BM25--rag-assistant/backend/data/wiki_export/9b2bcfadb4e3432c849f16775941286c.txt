Men's basketball
In recent years, the Wildcats Men's Basketball team has been extremely successful, acquiring a 55–3 record over the past two seasons (.948) and won the Triad Athletic Conference Championship two years in a row.  Home games regularly sell out the Finch Center, resulting in standing-room only crowds.  Most games are videotaped by the professional videographers of hoopmixtape.com and oneentertainmenthoops.com, both of which are companies who videotape strong High School Basketball programs in the South.  The Wildcats have been recognized by the national media, most notably ESPN's SportsCenter, twice in the past two seasons, both for acrobatic dunks during games.  The first, which occurred in January 2009, was a double alley-oop, where Georg Wolff lobbed the ball to Deuce Bello, who then again lobbed it to Ike Nwamu who dunked the ball.  In 2010, Deuce Bello performed a between-the-legs dunk during a game, a feat that is very rarely achieved, and was interviewed by SportsCenter's Jay Harris. Another play shown on sportscenter was a play involving Andre Iguodala and westchester graduate Quincy Miller.

Facilities
There are now six buildings on the rural campus, the largest, and newest, being the Finch Center, which includes Foreign Language, a computer lab, science, and health rooms. It also includes a basketball court.

There are two gymnasiums, three basketball courts, lighted soccer and baseball fields including indoor batting cages, and a practice soccer field.
