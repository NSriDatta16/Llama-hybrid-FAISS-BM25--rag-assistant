Thomas Butler (April 14, 1785 â€“ August 7, 1847) was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1818 to 1821 representing the state of Louisiana. He served one and a half terms as a Democratic-Republican.

Butler was born near Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He was selected in a special election to finish the term of Thomas B. Robertson in 1818 and was re-elected the same year to the Sixteenth Congress. He was later a member of the Whig party and of the American Party.  He died in St. Louis, Missouri.

Butler ran for Governor of Louisiana in the 1824 election but placed last with a mere 3% of the vote. In 1828 Butler again ran unsuccessfully for governor, placing second behind fellow National Republican Pierre Derbigny.
