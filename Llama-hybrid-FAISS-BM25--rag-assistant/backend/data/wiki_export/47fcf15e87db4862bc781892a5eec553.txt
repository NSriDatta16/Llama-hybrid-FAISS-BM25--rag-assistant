Michael David O'Brien (born 1948) is a Canadian author, artist, and essayist and lecturer on faith and culture. Born in Ottawa, he is self-taught, without an academic background. He writes and speaks on Catholic themes and topics, and creates the cover art for his novels in a neo-Byzantine style. He lives with his family in Combermere, Ontario, Canada.

O'Brien's books have been published in a number of foreign languages, including Croatian, Czech, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish.

Early life
O'Brien was born in Ottawa and lived in Kugluktuk (then known as Coppermine) from ages 12 to 16. He attended a residential school in Inuvik, where he says he was abused by a dormitory supervisor. He graduated from grade 12 at St Patrick's College High School only with difficulty. As a youth, he was agnostic, leaning towards atheism, until his conversion to Catholicism when he was 21.  He began to draw and paint shortly after, and had a successful gallery exhibition.  Five years later, at the urging of his wife, he began to turn his artwork towards religious subjects.  In 1994, at the age of 46, he began to write.

The novel includes depictions of a prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith who resembles Joseph Ratzinger and a Pope who resembles Pope John Paul II.

Non-fiction
O'Brien's articles and lectures focus on his belief that Western civilization is in severe decline as well as heading towards a "New Totalitarianism". A significant amount of his writing appeared first in Nazareth Journal, of which he was founding editor.

O'Brien's book A Landscape with Dragons: The Battle for Your Child's Mind – described as controversial by its publisher – presents his concern that contemporary children's literature and culture has strayed from Christian ethics to a more pagan ideology where good and evil is not strongly defined. The book features O'Brien's examination of fantasy works ranging from C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings to Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern. One of the book's central claims is that any story in which dragons are presented sympathetically rather than as forces of evil is implicitly anti-Christian because of the traditional use of the dragon as a symbol for Satan.
 
O'Brien has been critical of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, comparing it unfavourably with the work of Tolkien.
