The Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board or HSNC Board () is an Indian non-profit organisation founded in 1922 (or 1919) in the British India province of Sind and moved to Bombay, India after the 1947 Partition.
It is one of the oldest educational trusts of India and currently administers 27 institutes under its umbrella including the HSNC University, Mumbai.

History

The Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board, well known as HSNC board, is a charitable trust established by the Sindhi Community in 1922. It currently manages and administers 27 institutes under its umbrella and is presided by Mr Kishu Mansukhani.

The first college established by this Board in post-independence India was the Rishi Dayaram Gidumal National College or R. D. National College (commonly known as National College) founded in 1949 and located on Linking Road, Bandra.

However, the R.D. National College, Bandra traces its roots back to the D.G. National College that was established in 1917 at Hyderabad, Sind of Bombay Presidency, by the Sindhi-speaking Hindu community, under the inspiration of Dr. Annie Besant, President of Theosophical Society and Rishi Dayaram Gidumal, a Sindhi Hindu religious leader.
It was first named as "Sind National Arts College Hyderabad" and inaugurated on 1 October 1917 at Besant Hall, Hyderabad by Dr. Ernest Wood who also became its first Principal.  It was registered by the HSNC Board in February 1919 and was affiliated with Bombay University in 1921 to offer B.A. and later, B.Sc. degrees. 
In 1928, it was renamed  to Dayaram Gidumal National College, Hyderabad (Sind) (or in short, 'D.G. National College') and remained so until 1947 when Partition happened. 
Some of its famous Alumni included the veteran BJP leader L. K. Advani.
In 1930, Mr. K.M. Kundnani joined D.G. National College as Lecturer and became the Principal in 1947.
After Partition, Mr. Kundnani moved to India and re-established the college in Bandra, Mumbai in 1949, with critical assistance from Advocate H.G. Advani.  In fact, the entire HSNC Board was also moved from Hyderabad to Bombay along with its equipment, books and movable possessions and was re-established in Bombay.

The college that remained in Pakistan was suspended during 1947-1948 and got renamed as Government College Hyderabad (a.k.a. Kali Mori College) as it was taken over by the Government of Sind, Pakistan. 
In 2017, the Government of Sindh, Pakistan announced that it shall be upgraded to a University, as it completed one century of existence.

As of 2020, HSNC University has come into existence. It is a cluster university consisting of three prestigious colleges of the board; namely, KC College, HR College & Bombay Teacher's training Institute (BTTI). The University was launched on 11 June by Mr. Bhagat Singh Koshyari, the then-Governor of Maharashtra, in presence of Mr. Uddhav Thackeray, the Then-Chief Minister of Maharashtra
