Susam Sokağı is the Turkish co-production of American children's television program Sesame Street. It aired on weekday mornings at 9 am on TRT, the state television in Turkey, in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Production 
The show was coproduced by Children's Television Workshop and Turkish Radio and Television.

Filming began in 1989. Two seasons, for a total of 250 episodes, were filmed. Funding from CTW was $825,000 for the first season and $625,000 for the second season.

Content 
The show used an original street design, modeled after a traditional neighborhood, on which to film original content, and also translated and adapted older Sesame Street material.

Content was aimed at preparing children for school, and also included messages related to health and safety. One segment, for example, featured two contenders in a boxing ring who engage in a toothbrushing contest.
