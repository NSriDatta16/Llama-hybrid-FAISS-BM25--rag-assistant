Work and research interests

Giles Scott-Smith's research interests involve an exploration of the 'Transnational Transatlantic' - tracking the governmental and non-governmental linkages that have bound North America and Europe since World War II. This has branched out in many directions over the years, including political communication and linkages between ideas, ideology and power, the 'cultural Cold War' US foreign policy, the Atlantic Community, public diplomacy, the role of private individuals and institutions and their connections with the state in domestic and transatlantic foreign affairs. More precisely, Giles Scott-Smith's work has delved into: 
 The political, economic, and cultural dimensions of transatlantic relations during and after the Cold War;
 The role of NGOs and 'informal diplomacy' in international affairs; 
 The CIA, The Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), the 'cultural Cold War' between the East and the West, and the History of Intelligence.
 The theory and practice of public diplomacy, particularly exchange programs; 
 Anti-Communist networks and the importance of transnational organizations and elites in global governance.
