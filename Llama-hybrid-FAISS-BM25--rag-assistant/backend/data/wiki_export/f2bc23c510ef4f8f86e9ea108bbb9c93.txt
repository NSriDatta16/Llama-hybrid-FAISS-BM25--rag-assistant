Writing

Style 
Bakshi prepared only one draft for his writings. His language was a mix-up of Gujarati and Urdu words. His novels and stories had impact of existentialism, his characters are suffering and frustrated yet surviving. Ekra (1963) is one such example.  In his novels, the story was a chief element. He rejected social and literary taboos in his novels but his works were concerned for readers. He freely borrowed words and phrases from Hindi, Urdu and English in his works. He wrote historical fiction like Atitvan and Ayanvritta. His short stories have themes like complexities of urban life, emotional outbursts, and the atmosphere of war. He wrote extensively on history and culture. According to Rediff, his writing was 'sharp and brutal' when he criticised people he disliked. His biography Bakshinama was partially published in serialised form in Gujarati daily Samkalin. Some parts were not published due to its violent imagery like urinating on the dead body of his enemy.
