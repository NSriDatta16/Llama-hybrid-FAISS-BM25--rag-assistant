Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business () is a 1937 revision of Dale Carnegie's 1926 book Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men.  Dorothy Carnegie produced 2 separate revised editions:  How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People by Public Speaking (1956), aimed at the general public, and The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking (1962), as a replacement textbook for the Dale Carnegie Course.  A more recent revised edition is Public Speaking for Success (2005), revised by Arthur Pell, which restores content that was left out of the Dorothy Carnegie-revised works.

Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men, Public Speaking and Influencing Men In Business, and The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking served as standard textbooks in the Dale Carnegie Course.

The main focus of this book is to present a thorough understanding of the principles of public speaking, as well as guidance into conquering the fears attributed to public speaking.
