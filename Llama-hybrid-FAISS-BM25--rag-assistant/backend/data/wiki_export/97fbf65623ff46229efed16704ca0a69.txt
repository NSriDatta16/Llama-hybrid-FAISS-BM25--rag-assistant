Erdemli is a municipality and district of Mersin Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,279 km2, and its population is 151,928 (2022). It is  west of the city of Mersin.

Geography
Erdemli is located between the districts of Mezitli (to the east) and Silifke (to the west). In the north, Erdemli is bordered by Karaman Province and in the south by the Mediterranean Sea.

The district extends from the Mediterranean coastal plain, the largest agricultural area in Mersin Province, to high in the Taurus Mountains where there is forest, and then a large area (half the land area of the district) is high mountain above the treeline.

Erdemli is a quiet rural district where the people are conservative, and is traditionally a stronghold of Turkish nationalist politicians; however some departments of Mersin University are opening branches here which will surely have an effect on the cultural and social life of Erdemli in the future. There is no industry except some hand-weaving of rugs so the local economy depends on agriculture. The coastal plain is covered with citrus fruits, bananas, and various fruits and vegetables grown year-round in open fields or in greenhouses. High meadows in the mountains are planted with grain pulses and fruits such as apples, peaches, and cherries. At these altitudes there are also vineyards, olive groves, and fig trees.

This is an attractive forested coastal district, and Erdemli is now attracting investment in infrastructure to develop a tourist industry.

The coast is home to the endangered Mediterranean monk seal. The Middle East Technical University in Ankara has an Institute of Marine Sciences graduate school here, which has a biology group that monitors the seals.
