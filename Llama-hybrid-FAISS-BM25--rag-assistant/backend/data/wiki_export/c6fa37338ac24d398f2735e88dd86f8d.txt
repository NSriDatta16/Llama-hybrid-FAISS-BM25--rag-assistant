History
It was built to replace the old Manuel Rivera Stadium, located in the O Inferniño neighborhood, which gave way to a large public square and a shopping center. It was built by the company Agromán and financed with 1,700 million pesetas (just over 10 200 000 euros) by the Junta de Galicia.

It was designed by a team of five architects: Juan Pérez López de Gamarra, Francisco Iglesias Miño, Juan Rey-Cabarcos, Vicente Fernández-Couto and Alfredo Alcalá Navarro. 

The first match was played on April 18, 1993 in a league match between Racing and Atlético de Madrid B (3-2). However, it was officially inaugurated on August 29, 1993 with a match between Celta de Vigo and Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña.

Since the premiere of A Malata, Racing de Ferrol has played in the Second Division in the following campaigns:

The Ferrol stadium is also the scene of the Concepción Arenal trophy matches (born in 1953), highlighting the 1994 editions (with Aston Villa and Atlético de Madrid as contenders, with a British victory ) and 1995 (with Zaragoza and Ajax, with the Dutch team's final victory). In that year, a friendly match was also played between Racing de Ferrol and Borussia Dortmund.

A malata twin
The A Malata Stadium was taken as a model (along with the San Lázaro Multipurpose Stadium but without athletics tracks) when building the Reino de León Municipal Stadium. Both the dimensions of the playing rectangle (105 x 68) and the stands of A Malata are identical to those of the Kingdom of León. The Ferrol venue has 11,922 seats, all of them covered (compared to the 13,451 in the Leon stadium)
