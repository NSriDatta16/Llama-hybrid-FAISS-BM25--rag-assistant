"Twenty Two" is a song by the Swedish punk rock band Millencolin from the album For Monkeys. It was released as a single on 6 April 1997 by Shock Records, including two B-sides from the album's recording sessions, "Israelites" and "Vixen". These two tracks were re-released in 1999 on the compilation album The Melancholy Collection. "Twenty Two" was released only in Australia, in place of "Lozin' Must" which was released as the album's single in Europe and the United States, because "Lozin' Must" contained profanity.
