Gorham's Bluff is an unincorporated community, approximately three miles north of Pisgah at the top of Sand Mountain. It overlooks the Tennessee River valley.

Currently, Gorham's Bluff is not a recognized town, but part of the Pisgah area. Gorham's Bluff has a six-suite lodge and nine cottages. The lodge is the only property in Alabama to be accepted into the Cond√© Nast Traveler guide.

Since 1997, in collaboration with the Gorham Bluff's Institute, it has served as a venue for the Alabama Ballet in their pre-season.
