Internal strife 
On 7 July 1989, in accordance with the guru-shishya tradition, the then guru, Sudhindra Thirtha, initiated a follower into sanyasa so that in due course they would succeed him as the 21st guru. For reasons not fully known, serious differences between Sudhindra Tirtha and his appointed successor, Raghavendra Tirtha, became apparent around 2000–2001 amidst concerns about insubordination and integrity. On 19 July 2000, the mathadipathi removed Raghavendra Tirtha from his position of successor by making use of an earlier communication from November 1999 which had requested relief from the tutelage. This removal necessitated the initiation of a new shishya to succeed Sudindra Thirtha and this was done on 20 June 2002 when Samyamindra Thirtha were initiated.

Thereafter the tussle among the pontiffs turned into a dispute over the control of the Kashi Math and the ownership of its many valuables and ornaments used during various religious observances. Those included about 234 pieces of jewelry and silver articles, as well as 27 idols including the main idol of Vyasa Raghupathi. Raghavendra Tirtha had possession of these items but was ordered by Court in Tirupathi to give them to Sudhindra Tirtha. The Court upheld the status of the senior pontiff and the mathadhipathi, accepted the junior's abdication and directed him to return all belongings of the math and refrain from interfering in its affairs.

A petition seeking a stay on the order was dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court. The Supreme Court of India also confirmed the same on 2 December 2009 and upheld the High Court order recognizing Sudhendra Tirtha as mathadipadi.

After months of defying various court orders, Raghavendra Tirtha absconded with the valuables and ornaments and was arrested at Kadapa in October 2011.

Thereafter in November 2011, the 'parikaras' were handed over to Sudhindra Tirtha. Samyamindra Thirtha became main disciple (patta shishya) and successor (uttaradhikari) of Kashi Math.

Sudhindra Thirtha attained Vrindavan on 17 January 2016 at Vyasashram, Haridwar. As per the tradition, Samyamindra Thirtha became the new head of Kashi Math and they officially took charge on 28 January 2016 at Vyasashram, Haridwar. They are currently holding the 'parikaras' and offering the daily pujas.
