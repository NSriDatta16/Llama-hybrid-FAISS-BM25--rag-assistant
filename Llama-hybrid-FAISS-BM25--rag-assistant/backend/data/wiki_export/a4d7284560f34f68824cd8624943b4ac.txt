Buckton is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Bempton, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is near the North Sea coast, and about  north of Bridlington. It lies on the B1229 road. In 1931 the parish had a population of 174.

The village is adjacent to Bempton, and shares the same local services. To the west of the village is Buckton Hall, a grade II* listed building with large cellars. The hall had a tunnel which connected with the bottom of the cliffs which allowed for smuggling activities and as late as 1931, a hoist for hauling contraband, was still in the kitchen.

Buckton is a good place to find migrant birds, along Hoddy Cows Lane which runs from Buckton Cliffs to the north of the village. The cliffs at Buckton form part of the  coastal region between Speeton and Bempton that is noted for its chalk face and its seabird habitats. This is administered by the RSPB as part of Bempton Cliffs. Up until 1954, tenant farmers from Buckton and Bempton used to climb down the cliffs and collect bird's eggs, a practice known locally as "Climming".
