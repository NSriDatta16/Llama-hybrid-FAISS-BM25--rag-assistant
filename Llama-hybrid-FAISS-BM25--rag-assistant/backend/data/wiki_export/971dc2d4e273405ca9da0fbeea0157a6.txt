Twice in a Lifetime is a 1985 drama film directed by Bud Yorkin and starring Gene Hackman as a married steelworker in a mid-life crisis who becomes attracted to another woman, played by Ann-Margret. Ellen Burstyn, Amy Madigan, Ally Sheedy, and Brian Dennehy co-star. The film is a remake of the 1973 BBC drama, Kisses at Fifty, by the same writer.

Paul McCartney composed and performed the theme song to the film, heard over the end credits. It remained commercially unavailable as a recording until 1993 when it was included as a bonus track on a reissue of McCartney's album Pipes of Peace.

Plot
Harry Mackenzie works in a factory by day and comes home to a comfortable marriage at night, but it lacks excitement and passion. For his 50th birthday, his wife Kate blithely tells him to just go to his favorite corner tavern and have a good time.

An attractive barmaid, Audrey Minelli, captures his interest. Harry falls for her, and before long, shocks Kate by requesting a divorce. This decision horrifies their daughters, particularly Sunny, who is having a difficult marriage of her own, and Helen, who is about to be wed.

Kate goes through a difficult period of adjustment. She eventually lands a job in a beauty salon, changes her appearance, and tries to adopt a new outlook on life. By the time Harry attends his daughter Helen's wedding, most members of the family have found ways to move on.
