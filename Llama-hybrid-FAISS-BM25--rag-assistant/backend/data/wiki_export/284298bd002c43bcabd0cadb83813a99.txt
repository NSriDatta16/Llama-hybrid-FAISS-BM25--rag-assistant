Néstor Gabriel Lorenzo (born 26 February 1966) is an Argentine football manager and former player who played as a defender. He is the current head coach of the Colombia national team.

Lorenzo played for Argentinos Juniors, A.S. Bari, Swindon Town, Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro, Ferrocarril Oeste and Boca Juniors. Lorenzo also represented Argentina in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, including the final which the Argentines lost to Germany.

Playing career
After Italia '90 and after an attempt by Brian Clough to sign Lorenzo for Nottingham Forest fell through, Argentine legend Ossie Ardiles signed the defender for Swindon Town on loan and eventually the deal became a permanent switch.

Lorenzo played 27 times for Swindon, scoring two goals: one in his debut at the County Ground against Portsmouth in a 3–0 win, and one away at Watford in a 2–2 draw.

After seeing out his contract, Lorenzo returned to Argentina. He later turned his hand to coaching, and was part of José Pekerman's staff for the Argentina national team.

Managerial career

Colombia's football federation announced on June 2, 2022, it had picked Nestor Lorenzo to coach its men's national team for the next four years. The 56-year-old Argentinian replaced Reinaldo Rueda, who was fired from the job in April of the same year after Colombia failed to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar.  

As of June 2023, Lorenzo has led the national team to an undefeated record of 6 wins and 2 draws. On June 20, 2023, Colombia beat the Germany national team for the first time in its history in a dominant 2-0 victory under Lorenzo.
