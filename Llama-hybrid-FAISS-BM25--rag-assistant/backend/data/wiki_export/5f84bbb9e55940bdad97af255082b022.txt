Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode
The Mystery Science Theater 3000 presentation of the movie, episode #502, was first aired on 18 December 1993, on Comedy Central. The MST3K presentation edited the original movie to fit the TV show's time constraints, which causes Hercules'''s characters to go from "the midst of one plot development before the commercial ... [to] somewhere else entirely" afterwards.

Although two other MST3K episodes featuring Hercules movies (Hercules Against the Moon Men, at No. 49, and Hercules Unchained, at No. 61) were ranked in the Top 100 list of episodes as voted upon by MST3K Season 11 Kickstarter backers, Hercules did not make the cut. In his rankings of all 191 MST3K episodes, however, writer Jim Vorel ranked the episode #78, the highest of the four  Hercules movies that aired on Comedy Central. "Itâ€™s a mish-mash of Greek myth," Vorel writes, that is "the most purely entertaining film in the series. ... The total abject devotion of all the other men toward Hercules is naturally hilarious."

The MST3K version of Hercules was included as part of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXXII DVD collection, released by Shout! Factory on 24 March 2015. The other episodes in the four-disc set include Space Travelers (episode #401), Radar Secret Service (episode #520), and San Francisco International'' (episode #614).
