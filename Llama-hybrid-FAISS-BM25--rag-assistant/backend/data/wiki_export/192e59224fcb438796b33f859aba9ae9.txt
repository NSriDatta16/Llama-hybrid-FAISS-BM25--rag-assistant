Roman and Migration periods
The Roman Empire conquered the modern-day municipal area and its Celtic inhabitants in 85 BC. The Romans then built a road through the area to a ford on the Glems. This road, at first just for the Roman military, would shape Schwieberdingen's destiny as one of the few connections between the Rhine and the Danube. Emperor Hadrian in particular made great use of the road. Roman farming estates were established in the area of present-day Schwieberdingen.

In the 3rd century AD, the Alemanni conquered the Imperial province of Germania Superior and possibly established the first settlement in the municipal area. The territory of Schwieberdingen, then called "Suidbert-ingen", was fully established by 500, when the Franks subdued the Alemanni. The border between Francia and the Alemanni became, with the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples, the border of the dioceses of Speyer and of Constance. The Schwieberdingen of this time period must have been a military settlement to protect the important river crossing on the Glems. Other Alemannic settlements existed in the area, most notably , which was established between 750 and 802 but abandoned in the 14th century.
