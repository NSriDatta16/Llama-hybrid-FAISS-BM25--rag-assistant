Born on August 12, 1948, in Bromborough, Cheshire, Great Britain, Wynne-Jones emigrated to Canada in 1952, and was raised in British Columbia and Ontario. He currently lives in Perth, Ontario.

Wynne-Jones was educated at the University of Waterloo and Yale University, after having graduated from Ridgemont High School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. An additional formative experience was his participation in the St Matthew's Anglican Church choir of men and boys, of which he was for a time the Head Chorister.   He is a faculty member at Vermont College of Fine Arts, teaching in the Writing for Children and Young Adults MFA program.

Writing 
Tim Wynne-Jones' first book was Odd's End which is said to have been written over the space of five weeks while his wife was away. It was published By McClelland & Stewart in 1980 and won the $50,000 Seal First Novel Award. Since then, Wynne-Jones has written more than 20 books, including picture books, novels for children and young adults, as well as three novels for adults. His work has been widely reviewed and he has won several awards, including two Boston Globe–Horn Book Awards from The Horn Book Magazine for children's fiction published in the U.S. (1995, 2011); three Governor General's Literary Awards in Canada (1993, 1995, 2009); three Canadian Library Association Prizes; the Arthur Ellis Award from the Crime Writers of Canada (2001); and the Edgar Award for Young Adult Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America (2002).
