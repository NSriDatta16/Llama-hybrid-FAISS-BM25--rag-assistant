History
The land in Delaware Seashore State Park saw frequent natural changes in the location of the inlet between the inland bays and the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, it was difficult to travel across this stretch of land. In 1939, two jetties were built to stabilize the Indian River Inlet at its present location. Indian River State Park was created by the State Park Commission in 1965, with the name becoming Delaware Seashore State Park in 1967. In 1966, the strip of land between the Little Assawoman Bay to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east between South Bethany and Fenwick Island became a separate southern portion of the park. In 1981, the southern section of Delaware Seashore State Park became Fenwick Island State Park.

The Indian River Life-Saving Station was built in 1876 by the United States Life-Saving Service in order to respond to shipwrecks along the Delaware coast. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is open to the public.
