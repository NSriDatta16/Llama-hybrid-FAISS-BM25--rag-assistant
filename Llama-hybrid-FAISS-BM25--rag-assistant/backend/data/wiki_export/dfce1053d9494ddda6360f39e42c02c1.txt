"The One with Rachel's Date" was directed by Gary Halvorson and co-written by Brian Buckner and Sebastian Jones.

Plot

Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) visits Joey (Matt LeBlanc) on the set of Days of Our Lives, where she meets Kash, another actor on the soap opera. She asks Joey to set them up on a date. Joey is at first pessimistic because of Rachel's pregnancy. Rachel convinces him and then struggles to persuade Ross, who is fearful about what impact the date would have on the baby. After she leaves, Ross admits to Joey his disappointment in not having his children living with him as he always pictured having his next child grow up with him and his future wife, possibly Rachel, together as a happy family, but Joey comforts him and suggests he could still have this future with a different wife. The date ends early when Rachel accidentally tells Kash that she is pregnant, and she bumps into Ross on the street and confesses to him that she may be done with dating entirely. Ross assures her that she will love her baby more than any other man. Having initially declined an offer to join Ross at Central Perk for a coffee, Rachel changes her mind, but then sees him getting acquainted with Mona (Bonnie Somerville), whom he met at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception, and leaves, unseen.

Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) visits Monica (Courteney Cox) at her kitchen at Alessandro's, where she meets Tim, Monica's sous-chef. Phoebe and Tim really like each other, and Monica sets them up on a date. Monica wants to fire Tim because he is a really slow and clumsy worker, but Phoebe dissuades her from doing so. One day later, Monica still wants to fire him, and Phoebe wants to dump him because he is too anxious. Initially agreeing not to dump and fire him on the same day, they then argue about who should dump or fire him that day. When Phoebe meets with Tim at Central Perk to dump him, he gets paged by Monica for a meeting at work. This then results in Phoebe storming into Monica's workplace, interrupting the meeting. Left with no other options, Phoebe dumps Tim and Monica fires him simultaneously. However, when Tim says that Monica is the best chef he knows, she gives him another chance.

Whilst picking up Chandler (Matthew Perry) from his office for dinner plans, Ross meets Bob (Chris Parnell), a co-worker of Chandler who has always called him Toby for the last five years. While putting this into perspective, Chandler accidentally reveals that his middle name is Muriel, and Ross and Rachel make fun of him. When Chandler's boss wants Chandler's opinion about adding Bob to his team, Chandler is negative about it. When Bob finds out it was Chandler who blocked his promotion, he vents his anger to Chandler, who he still thinks is called Toby. Chandler then attempts to reveal his true identity to Bob, but cannot go through with it when he realises that Bob will be even angrier at him for it. Bob finally finds Chandler's office and starts trashing it. When Bob asks Chandler for help, he happily joins in destroying his own office.
