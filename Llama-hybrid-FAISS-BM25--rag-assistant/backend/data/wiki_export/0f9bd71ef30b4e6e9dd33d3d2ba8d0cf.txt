The Courts Service is a statutory body that provides administration and support services to the Courts of the Republic of Ireland. It was established in 1999 by the Courts Service Act 1998. Its head office is at Phoenix House, Smithfield, Dublin.

Functions

 managing the courts,
 providing support services for the judges,
 providing information on the courts system to the public,
 providing, managing and maintaining court buildings, and
