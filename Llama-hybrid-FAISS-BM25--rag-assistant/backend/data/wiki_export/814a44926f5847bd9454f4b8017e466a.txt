LSU Tigers
Luster achieved major success after moving to LSU in 1985. In his first season at Baton Rouge, the Lady Tigers claimed the Southeastern Conference title while recording a 33–10 record. The very next season LSU won another SEC title, as well as an NCAA berth with a 35–9 mark.

Luster's best years at LSU were 1990 and 1991, when his teams were a combined 69–9, won two more SEC titles, and made two NCAA Final Four appearances. During the 1990 season, LSU put together a 32-match home-court winning streak, which ranks as the 10th longest such streak in NCAA history.

Overall, Luster was 308–161 in 13 seasons at LSU, including an 88–56 record in SEC contests. His teams won five SEC titles, earned six NCAA Tournament berths and his 1991 team's .946 winning percentage (a 35–2 record) is the best single-season mark in SEC history. Luster was named the SEC Coach of the Year three times, and coached six All-Americans. His last season as LSU women's head coach was 1997.

Bradley Braves
Luster fashioned an overall record of 134–164 during his ten seasons (1998–2007) at Bradley. Due to poor performance in the 2007 season, Bradley decided to not renew his contract at the end of the year.

After moving to Columbus, Ohio, Luster coached five seasons at Whitehall-Yearling High School, winning the 1979 AAA state championship and being honored by the Columbus Dispatch as the Coach of the Year.

Luster has served on both the executive committee and Board of Directors for the United States Volleyball Association.
