Tour Adria (also known as tour Technip) is an office skyscraper located in La Défense, the high-rise business district situated west of Paris, France. It has a triangular floorplan.

Built in 2002 by Michel Andrault and Nicolas Ayoub, architects from Conceptua, it is a twin of the nearby Tour Égée, which was built three years before in 1999. The only difference between both towers consists in their cladding: the one from Égée is white when the one from Adria is darker with windows looking like vertical glass stripes. Tour Adria is 155 m (509 ft) tall.

Since its construction it has been occupied by the French engineering company Technip as its group headquarters.
