Känn ingen sorg för mig Göteborg is the debut studio album from Swedish musician Håkan Hellström. It was released on 16 October 2000. The album has sold over 40,000 copies, which equals a platinum certification in Sweden.

Music and lyrics
Musically, the album has been described as a Swedish version of Born to Run-era Bruce Springsteen, with upbeat songs, ringy guitars, trumpet leads and vocal harmonies. Lyrically, Hellström drew inspiration from his musical and lyrical heroes such as Morrissey and Bob Dylan, and the topics are often bittersweet or melancholic reflections of unrequited love, decadent youth culture (including drug use) or the feeling of being an outsider. For example, the song "Atombomb" contains references to Morrissey's "Everyday Is Like Sunday" and The Smiths' "William, It Was Really Nothing", while "Uppsnärjd i det blå" refers to Dylan's "Tangled Up in Blue" and "I Think We're Alone Now" by Tommy James & the Shondells.

Accolades
The album won the 2000 Rockbjörnen in the category "Swedish record of the year", and was nominated for six Grammis the following year, winning one. Swedish music magazine Sonic named it the second best Swedish album ever in June 2013.
