Design 
The car was presented at the 2006 Belgrade Motor Show. The car was nearly identical to the facelifted Punto, with the only noticeable difference being the Zastava badges instead of Fiat ones. The only improvements to the Zastava 10 in relation to the Fiat Punto was that the engine reached Euro 4 standards, and there was a more modernized colour palette, similar to the Fiat Grande Punto.

The Zastava 10 only came with a 1.2 litre 8 valve petrol engine producing 60 horsepower and a 5-speed manual, both found on the Punto. The engine was able to propel the car to a top speed of 155Â km/h. There were a choice of 5 trim levels on the car: Standard, Standard+, Comfort, Dynamic and Impressionante.

Sales 
Zastava only sold the 10 in the Serbian domestic market. Sales of the Zastava 10 amounted to over 10 percent of the market share in Serbia.
