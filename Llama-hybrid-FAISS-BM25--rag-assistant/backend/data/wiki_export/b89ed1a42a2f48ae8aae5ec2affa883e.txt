Lindbergh High School  is a (senior) high school in the southeastern section of Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, in the Renton School District. It is named after Charles A. Lindbergh, the famous aviator who was first to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927. The school was founded in 1972. Freshmen, sophomores and juniors attended the first year, making the class of 1974 the first to graduate. Lindbergh's school motto is ad astra, which is Latin for "to the stars". The crest features the Spirit of St. Louis (the plane that Charles Lindbergh flew), and the school's motto flanked by stars with the dates 1927 and 1972, respectively.

Facilities

Architecture

Lindbergh features unusual architecture compared to traditional boxy high school buildings. Originally intended to be a community college, the school is constructed with concrete floors and brick walls with wooden beams supporting sloped roofs. The building stretches up and across a small hill. It was originally built around two "houses", where home rooms and lockers were located, with a third planned house for expansion that was never built. The floors and sections of the school still function as a kind of departmental divide, with the right side of the third floor containing the math classes, the first floor containing the language arts classes, etc. Another distinct feature is a skybridge linking the main building with the gymnasium and the student parking lot.

In 1998, Renton voters approved a construction bond to rebuild, remodel, and renovate school buildings throughout the district. Following this bond, other unique architectural features of Lindbergh were replaced or redesigned. The school was originally built featuring many open areas in addition to conventional walled classrooms, but most of these spaces were closed by the 1990s. The original lockers were small wooden cube-shaped coat racks placed out in the open, but this use was abandoned as coats could not be securely hung and the wooden hangers were found to be easily broken, and were replaced by conventional steel lockers.

The former steel and auto shop was converted to a robotics lab as of the mid-1990s. As of June 2006, building of a new commons area is complete, and as of the 2007–2008 school year, all bathrooms within the school have been remodeled. The school also recently underwent a 2-year remodel to replace asbestos-containing areas of the building. During the spring of 2009, a football and track field have been constructed behind the school. In 2010, the weight room has been renovated along with replacing the roofs and window exterior. At the start of the 2011–2012 school year, the staff parking lot, walkways have been remodeled and added throughout the school. When the summer vacation 2012 started, the hill in the center of the lower parking lot has been torn out to make improvements on both student and lower parking lots have begun, this all summer long construction consists of making more parking spaces and the improvement of traffic when dropping and picking up students, and an undercover area for students to stand in when it rains or on warm sunny days to keep them dry and away from the sun's rays up in the upper parking lot. While that was in process, inside the building had some undergone renovations as well. Classrooms with emergency exit doors have all been replaced with brand new doors.

In the 2018–2019 school year, all classroom doors were replaced with ones that are able to be locked from the inside rather than the previous models that were only lockable from the outside. The new door is made of steel and has a wood grain finish on the surface along with smaller windows.

Demographics

When the school was opened in 1972, each class had only a handful of Asian, Hispanic and African American students, though one notable Asian American family sent seven children to MIT and Stanford. Today, Lindbergh, along with Renton High School, Foster High School, Tyee Educational Complex, and many other south King County schools, is noted in its region for its diversity. In 2013, Lindbergh had an Asian student population of 24.7%, as well as nearly 20.3% African American, 20% Hispanic, and 1.9% American Indian/Alaskan Native/Pacific Islander. 49% of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, 13% receive special education services, 12.5% are transitional bilingual (and many more are native speakers of both English and another language).
