The Nicosia Music Society was established in 1971 as "Zenon" choir of Larnaca by composer and Professor of Music Michael Hadjiloizou, a certified choir director and the first Cypriot to compose operas/melodramas, who has since been the Society's president and artistic director.

Organization
NMS is an officially registered organization under the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Cyprus and it is run by a five-member board of directors. It includes:
 Four-voice mixed chorus, dramatic, and melodramatic group.

According to its constitution, NMS's basic pursuit is the projection of Greek-Cypriot music creation through all artistic expression.

The Society has made numerous trips abroad, touring major cities in Austria, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, England, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

Under the direction of Mr. Hadjiloizou, NMS has published three original records: i. Του Λαού και της Πατρίδας ("Tou Laou kai tis Patridas", Of the People and Fatherland), ii. Ελλήνων Μαρτυρία ("Ellinon Martyria", Greek Confession), iii. Ορθοδόξων Μαρτυρία ("Orthodoxon Martyria", Orthodox Confession).
