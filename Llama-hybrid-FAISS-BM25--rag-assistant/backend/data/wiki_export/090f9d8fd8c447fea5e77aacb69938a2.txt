The Will Rogers Archway, originally named the Glass House Restaurant and still nicknamed "The Glass House", is a  service station that spans the Will Rogers Turnpike section of InterstateÂ 44 (I-44) near Vinita, Oklahoma. Previously operating as a McDonald's restaurant, it was notable as the first bridge restaurant in the world and as an example of a U.S. roadside restaurant. When it was solely a McDonald's, it was the world's largest McDonald's before the current largest McDonald's in the world located in Orlando, Florida was built. 

The archway also features a Kum & Go (previously a Phillips 66) gas station.

The building and service plaza closed on June 4, 2013, for a $14.6 million renovation. At its grand reopening on December 22, 2014, it was renamed from "Glass House Restaurant" to "Will Rogers Archway", although the renaming was actually officiated in August 2014. McDonald's still operates in the archway post-renovation, but it is now joined by a separate Subway franchise in the building.

At the front of the west anchor stands a statue of Will Rogers. The building contains a small Will Rogers museum.
