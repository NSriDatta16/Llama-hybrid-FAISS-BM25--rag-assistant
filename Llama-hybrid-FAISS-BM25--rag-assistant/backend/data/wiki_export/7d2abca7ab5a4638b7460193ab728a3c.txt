While the state law allowing municipal and regional governments to form regional cohorts was passed in 1997, the council began its electricity supplier program in 2006 with school districts and municipal governments as clients. In 2010, the council move to become the franchised electricity supplier for residential service in the member-towns.

Hadley town meeting voted to withdrawal from the council on October 5, 2017, while Belchertown Town Meeting voted to leave on May 14, 2018.
