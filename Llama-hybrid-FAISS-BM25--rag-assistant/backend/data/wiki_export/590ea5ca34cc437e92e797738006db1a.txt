Providence Catholic High School (often referred to as Providence, Provi, or abbreviated PCHS) is a Roman Catholic secondary school located in New Lenox, Illinois.  Located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Joliet, Providence Catholic is a private school run by the Order of Saint Augustine and is a member of the Augustinian Secondary Education Association..

The school is located at the crossroads of Lincoln Highway (also part of U.S. Highway 30) and Interstate 80.

History
Providence Catholic High School began as St. Mary Academy for Girls, a commercial school in Joliet, Illinois run by the Sisters of Loretto.  The school opened in 1880, though the original building was not opened until 1883.  Eventually, academic classes were added.

In 1918, the Archdiocese of Chicago invited the Sisters of Providence to take over the school. On October 22 of that year, the school's name was changed to Providence High School.  In 1931, the academic classes were stopped as the Great Depression took its toll on the school.  In 1932, the school reverted to a two-year commercial school.  A four-year secretarial program opened in 1938.  Though the academic courses were reinstated after the Depression, the school building was condemned as a fire hazard in 1959 and demolished.  From 1959 through 1962, the school met at St. Mary Nativity Elementary School.  When the old building was demolished, it is said that students sifted through the wreckage looking for bricks that were not crushed. They wrapped the bricks and sold them as souvenirs to help build the new Providence.

In 1962, the modern Providence High School was opened.  The most obvious change was location:  the school had left Joliet and was now located a few miles to the east in New Lenox.  The other major change was the shift to a coed school.  Though Providence was a relatively new school, the community of New Lenox was not heavily populated then.  Enrollment decreased, and the school began suffering financially.  Father Roger Kaffer (later Bishop Kaffer) was named the new principal and arrived in 1970.  He began a campaign to improve the academic standing of the school and the transportation options for students traveling great distances. It was his practice to visit every family that had a child enrolled in the school.  The 1971 enrollment was 490; by 1975, it had reached 785.  Growth during the late 1970s and early 1980s made additions to the school building necessary.

The Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel, the Midwest U.S. province of the Order of Saint Augustine, was invited by the diocese to take control of the school after the 1984–85 school year.  A college preparatory curriculum was added, as was a refocus on the spiritual mission of the school.  The religious studies course work was upgraded, and a retreat program was begun.  The name of the school was changed to "Providence Catholic High School" in 1985 to reflect these changes.  In 1998, the school decided to limit enrollment in order to retain a more personal atmosphere with students. The school has added 55,000 square feet to the original building with the addition of a science and fine arts wing in 2002 and a Student Commons Addition in 2018.  Today the school sits on 75 acres with three campuses.  In 2018 the school celebrated its 100th Anniversary as Providence Catholic High School.
