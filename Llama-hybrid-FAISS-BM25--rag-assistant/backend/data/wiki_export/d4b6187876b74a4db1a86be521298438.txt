State of Shock is the fifth solo studio album by American heavy metal musician Ted Nugent. It was released in May 1979 by Epic Records.

State of Shock closed a decade in which Nugent took his hard-rocking wildman persona to the top of the charts. Although the album reached the U.S. Top 20 and quickly went gold, it is Nugent's first solo album not to attain a platinum certification.

The best known track remains the album opener "Paralyzed", which was performed live on a 1980 episode of the TV show Fridays, and turned up again a year later on Great Gonzos! The Best of Ted Nugent. Other highlights include "Saddle Sore" and "Alone", a rare power ballad for him, sung by Charlie Huhn. A live show from this era is captured on the 1997 archive release Live at Hammersmith '79.
