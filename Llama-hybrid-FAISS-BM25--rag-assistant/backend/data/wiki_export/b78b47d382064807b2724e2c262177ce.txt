The Samoa Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) was a public broadcaster in the South Pacific island country of Samoa. Its operations were based in Mulinu'u, Apia. SBC was created by an act of Parliament in 2003, replacing the old Western Samoa Broadcasting Department. This government entity include both the former Televise Samoa & Radio 2AP. The SBC broke up in 2008. TV1 Samoa is now the main television station of Samoa. SBC's radio stations still broadcast but are now privately owned.

SBC Radio 1 and SBC FM 
SBC Radio 1 (formerly Radio 2AP), 540AM, broadcasts news, current affairs, talk, information, entertainment, music and audio content in the Samoan language. It can be heard clearly in Niue, Tokelau and emails from Samoans in Alaska say they too get snatches of it. It is the radio station of choice in many American Samoa households as well as Samoa.

The SBC Radio 1 complex in Mulinu'u houses SBC Radio 1's operations, just next door to SBC TV. There is also SBC-FM, 88.1FM, which is an English-language station delivering news, entertainment and music in the English Language. This station is housed inside the SBC TV compound, Mulinu'u.

SBC Television 1
SBC television, formerly Televise Samoa, reaches 95% of independent Samoa, getting blocked only by mountains at Uafato, Fagaloa.
SBC TV 1 is Samoa's national television station, currently broadcasting from 6am to midnight. SBC TV 1 usually broadcasts local news and entertainment, plus news from New Zealand's TVNZ One News and the usual broadcasts from BBC & ABC Australia during the morning and afternoons weekdays. In addition to funding from the Samoan Government, SBC's television programs are also funded by commercials.
