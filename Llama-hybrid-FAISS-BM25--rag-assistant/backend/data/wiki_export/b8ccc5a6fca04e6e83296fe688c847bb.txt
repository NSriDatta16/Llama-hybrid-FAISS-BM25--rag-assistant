History 
SBI Route 107 originally ran from Pike Station (located at what is now U.S. Route 54 and the Mississippi River) to Griggsville. In 1935, all of the routes south of Pittsfield was changed to U.S. 54, leaving the portion between Pittsfield and Griggsville as Illinois 107. In 1964 the northern extension to Mount Sterling was added. In 1992, U.S. 54 replaced Illinois 107 north to the new U.S. Route 36 freeway, which then became Interstate 72. As a result, Illinois 107 and U.S. 54 now terminate at the same interchange.
