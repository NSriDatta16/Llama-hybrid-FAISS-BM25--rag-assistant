History and facilities

Clayton Heights is one of the smallest high schools in Surrey due to the proximity of Lord Tweedsmuir Secondary School which is approximately five kilometers away. The school was built to accommodate the growing population in Cloverdale.  The school's enrollment has increased significantly and as of 2018 it was 400 students over a capacity until the opening Salish Secondary School which eased off the overcrowding at the school
