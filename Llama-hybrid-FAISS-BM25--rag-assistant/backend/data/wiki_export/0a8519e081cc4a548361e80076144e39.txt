Huntley High School is a public high school in Huntley, Illinois, United States. The catchment area includes Consolidated School District 158, which includes all of Huntley as well as parts of Lake in the Hills, Algonquin, and other surrounding communities and rural areas.

The Building

The current building, located at 13719 Harmony Road in Huntley, was constructed in 1997, and at the time was the school district's first new building in about 30 years.  It was originally designed as a middle-high school, with a shared cafeteria and library in the center of the building. The original high school building, located on Mill Street in Huntley, was built in the 1960s and only featured about a dozen classrooms and outdated facilities.  In the 1990s, the district's enrollment increased with suburban growth, and the school facilities needed to be expanded. After the new building was built in 1997, the old building served grades 4â€“5, before finally being converted into a recreational center when it was sold to the Huntley Park District in the early 2000s.

Additions
In 1999, the building's first major addition was a 12 classroom wing on the west end designed for temporary usage for grades 5 through 8.  In 2005, when the new elementary and middle schools were built, this wing served the high school's mathematics, foreign language, and social studies classes.

In 2002, substantial additions were made to both the west and east sides of the building.  On the west end, was a second wing which created a new main office for the high school, special education classrooms, high school science labs and classrooms, and eighth grade classrooms.  A four-classroom wing housing health classrooms and a computer lab connected the two western wings and completely surrounded the west gym (middle school gym).

The east addition provided the high school with a much larger gym, art and music classrooms, a 700-seat auditorium, student facilities and administrative offices.

In 2005, upon completion of the district's two new middle schools, the use of the building was allocated to high school classrooms and services only. Space has already been dedicated for an additional high school at the Square Barn Road Campus in Algonquin, Illinois.

Athletic complex
The school's athletic complex includes a football field and track, Field house with track and basketball courts, wrestling mat room, administrative and  maintenance buildings, three softball fields, two baseball fields, ten tennis courts, a practice football field, and two soccer fields in front.

Performing Arts Center
The Performing Arts Center was built as part of an addition to the school in 2002 and features approximately 700 seats. The tone of the theater is dominated by red and black, the school's colors. In addition to the stage and seating areas, the theater also features an orchestra pit, backstage rooms, and balconies. The center hosts high school plays, middle school plays, musical performances, performances from outside groups, assemblies, presentations, and award ceremonies.

Mascot
Until 2002, Huntley High School's mascot had been the Huntley Redskins. In the late 1990s, the school district faced threats of legal action by Native American groups claiming the mascot was a racial slur and in 2002 its use was abolished. A new mascot was adopted in 2002 as a closer option to the original mascot. The Huntley High School mascot is now a Red Raider, naming them, the "Huntley Red Raiders".
