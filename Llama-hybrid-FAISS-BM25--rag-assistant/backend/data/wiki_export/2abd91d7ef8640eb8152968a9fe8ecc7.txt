Controversies 
In 2022, Ruggedman lost the Headies Humanitarian Award to Davido, another Nigerian Artist, and was notably stating that the Headies was “just a popularity contest and Davido was undeserving.”

In 2002, Ruggedman released the controversial song "Ehen" featuring Nomoreloss. The song which was a direct to diss to then established acts in the Nigeria music industry had him mentioning names of Eedris Abdulkareem, Black Reverendz, Maintain and Rasqui for their apparent lack of lyrical contents or originality in their songs.
