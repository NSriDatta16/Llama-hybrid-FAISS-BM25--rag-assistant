Pipe Dream is the student newspaper of Binghamton University (State University of New York at Binghamton) in Vestal, N.Y. Content is published online throughout the week at bupipedream.com, as well as in print every Tuesday.

Printed as a tabloid until spring 2012, Pipe Dream now prints as a broadsheet paper with full-color front and back pages. 

Pipe Dream is one of the few student newspapers in the country that is and always has been entirely student-run, without the supervision or assistance of an advisor. Though there is no journalism school at Binghamton University, Pipe Dream was named in 2010 as one of the nation's top college newspapers by the Princeton Review.

History: The Free Word on Campus
Pipe Dream was first published in the form of The Colonial News on November 22, 1946, the same year as the founding of Triple Cities Colleges, the forebear of Binghamton University. The Colonial News first editors wrote:

The paper's name was changed to Pipe Dream in 1970 in protest of the Vietnam War.

Pipe Dream printed a bi-weekly paper until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, officially becoming a weekly newspaper in spring 2023.

Circulation
The newspaper is distributed at Binghamton University's main campus in Vestal, New York, and at several spots in Downtown Binghamton, including the newly built University Downtown Center. All copies are distributed openly and are free to the public.

Format
Pipe Dream regularly prints the following sections:
News: Updates on the latest in campus, local and national news from student journalists. Notably includes Police Watch which details incidents of alleged illegal incidents on campus as filed by campus police.
Arts & Culture: Arts and entertainment section which features stories about events on- and off-campus and about popular culture at large.
Opinion: Oriented towards campus affairs, national and global politics, as well as broader issues of campus life and humor.

Criticism
In 2005, Pipe Bomb, Pipe Dream's annual April Fool's edition, ran a joke story about a fictitious campus van service that parodied "Safe Ride," a free late-night shuttle on campus. Activists stole most of the issues soon after the papers hit newsstands and demanded that the Binghamton University administration either force Pipe Dream's editors to undergo sensitivity training or revoke the group's Student Association-chartered status. (Without S.A.-chartered status, Pipe Dream would have no longer been an officially sanctioned student group, possibly leading to it being evicted from its campus office space and having to pay its own media insurance premiums.) In the end, no action was taken.
