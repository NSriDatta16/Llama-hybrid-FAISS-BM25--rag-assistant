"Jungle Man" is a song by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers from their 1985 album, Freaky Styley. It was released as the album's first single, however failed to chart. A music video released around the same time of the album's release on August 16, 1985. The band couldn't get a proper music video released, so manager Lindy Goetz used different clips of live performances of the song from May 1985 to January 1986 edited together with the album version of the song playing on top. 

In his autobiography "Scar Tissue", Anthony Kiedis reveals the song is an ode to his friend Flea: "this half man, half beast born in the belly of the volcano in Australia and using his thumb as a conductor of thunder on the bass".

Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic considered "Jungle Man" to be one of the highlights from the album.

Reception
John Leland at Spin said, "Take away the Chilis' glaring flaws and they're just another band. Much of this record sounds like a bunch of white guys playing funk. They do it with some Ã©lan, and Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns help, but they sacrifice some of their identity for the sake of competence.
