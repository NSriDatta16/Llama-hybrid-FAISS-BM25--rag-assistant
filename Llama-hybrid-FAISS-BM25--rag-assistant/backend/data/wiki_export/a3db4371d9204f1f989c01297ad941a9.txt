Dennis Michael Gibson (born February 8, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) from 1987 to 1995 for the Detroit Lions and the San Diego Chargers. He played college football for the Iowa State Cyclones. He was selected by the Lions in the eighth round of the 1987 NFL Draft. Perhaps his most memorable moment came in the 1994 AFC Championship Game, when he sent the Chargers to the Super Bowl by lunging to block a 4th-down pass attempt from Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Neil O'Donnell in the end zone to win the game.
