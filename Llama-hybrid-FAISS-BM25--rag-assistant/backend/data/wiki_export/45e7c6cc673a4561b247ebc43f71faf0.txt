The Wolf Devil
The villain of the serial is one of film's first werewolves (in the traditional sense of a man masquerading and acting like a wolf rather than the now more common film wolfman).  This villain, The Wolf Devil, wears a wolf skin headdress that completely covers his face.  The supernatural atmosphere is enhanced by his apparent ability to control a pack of wolves.
