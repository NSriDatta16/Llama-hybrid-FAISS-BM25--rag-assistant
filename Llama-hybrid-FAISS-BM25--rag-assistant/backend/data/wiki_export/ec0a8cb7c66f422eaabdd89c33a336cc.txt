The tuberculum sellae (or the tubercle of the sella turcica) is a slight median elevation upon the superior aspect of the body of sphenoid bone (that forms the floor of the middle cranial fossa) at the anterior boundary of the sella turcica (hypophyseal (pituitary) fossa) and posterior boundary of the chiasmatic groove. A middle clinoid process flanks the tuberculum sellae on either side.
