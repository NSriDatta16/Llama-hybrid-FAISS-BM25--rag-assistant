was a Japanese composer, and the brother of composer Maki Ishii. His father, Baku Ishii, was a prominent Japanese ballet dancer. His Symphonia Ainu won a prize at the 1958 Art Festival, inspiring him to do further work inspired by nationalist primitivism. His musical style appeals directly to the emotions, and shows the influence of Carl Orff. In addition to orchestral and vocal music, he has written extensively for the stage, including 6 operas, 3 ballets and 9 film scores, including the 1962 science-fiction film Gorath. Ishii accepted a position as professor at Sh≈çwa College of Music in 1986.
