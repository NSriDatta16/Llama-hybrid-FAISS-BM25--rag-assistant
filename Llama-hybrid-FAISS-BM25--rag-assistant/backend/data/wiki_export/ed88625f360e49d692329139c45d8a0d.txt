Penne (, ; Pònne in the local dialect) is an Italian town in the province of Pescara, in the Abruzzo region, in mid-southern Italy. According to the last census in 2014 the population was 12,451. It is a member of the I Borghi più belli d'Italia ("The most beautiful villages of Italy") association.

Penne is today among the most important towns in the Vestini area, sitting in the hills between the Apennine Mountains and the Adriatic Sea and opening the way for the National Park of Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga through the Regional Natural Reserve "Lake of Penne".

The widespread use of bricks in every historical building and paving gave Penne the appellation of "Città del mattone", i.e. the "Town of Bricks". In 2006, Penne was awarded the Silver Medal of Civic Merit for events suffered during World War II.

The economy of Penne is driven mainly by tourism, agriculture, the regional hospital and Brioni, the Italian fashion house whose suits are still hand sewn by Pennese women.

In November 2017, Penne was chosen as the starting point for Stage 10 of the 2018 Giro d'Italia. Cyclists left from Penne and climbed to Rigopiano and then beyond to Umbria.

History
The town is ancient, having been occupied from at least the mid-neolithic period. It was a seat of government of the Vestini people no later than 300 BC. In around 89 BC, the Vestini along with other Italic tribes were defeated by the Romans in the Social War, and became citizens of Rome. The town was known as Pinna Vestinorum during the time of the Roman Republic.

In the Middle Ages, Penne was under the control of the Lombards as part of the Duchy of Spoleto. Starting around 1130 Penne became part of the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1538 the town was given by emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to his daughter Margaret of Parma as a gift for her wedding to Ottavio Farnese. Under Margaret, Penne became important as a center of power in the Abruzzo region, and many fine palaces and civic structures were erected during this time.

Geography
Penne is a town on the Adriatic side of the Abruzzo region, sitting on several hills between the valleys of the Tavo and Fino rivers. Penne covers an area measuring about 91.20 km2 . It is 31 km from Pescara, 35 km from Chieti; and 67 km from Teramo.

Climate
Penne benefits from the moderating effects of the nearby Adriatic sea (only 20 km away from the town; as the crow flies) but at the same time its weather is influenced by the Gran Sasso mountain chain. According to the climatic data collected during the period 1961-1990, the average temperature of the coldest month, i.e. January, is +5,6 °C where the minimals are about 2-3 °C while the maximals about 9-11 °C; in the hottest month, August, the average temperature is +24,7 °C where the minimals are about 19 °C, while the maximals 30 °C. The climate is therefore characterized by hot summers and rather mild winters, where the annual thermal excursion is anyway lower than 21 °C like in the coast. However, in winter snow and frosts might happen when cold currents from the Balkans or the northern Europe irrupt on the Adriatic coast. During these episodes, minimal temperatures can fall down to -5 °C. Precipitation levels are on average about 845 mm per year according to the climatic data collected during the period 1951 - 2009  and are generally higher than the ones observed in other hillside cities in the sea-side of Abruzzo (around 600–700 mm per year). The climate in Penne can be therefore considered as Mediterranean due to the beneficial influence of the Adriatic sea on the temperatures. However, from a pluviometric stand-point, the town's weather sits in the borderline in between a subtropical humid and mediterranean weather. In summertime, precipitation is uncommon and mainly occurs in the form of thunderstorms.

Main sights

The main characteristic of the old town is its streets and houses are built in bricks, so in the past Penne was known as "the small Siena".

Penne's churches include the 12th-century church of Santa Maria in Colleromano, and the Duomo, which now houses the Diocese Museum including a crypt dating from the 8th century.
