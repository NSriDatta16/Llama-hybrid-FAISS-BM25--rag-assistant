History

Located in the northern portion of the San Diego city limits, Mira Mesa is located in an area once situated by Native American tribes. Due to much of the land being considered wasteland, it was not put to much use for years until in the early 1960s. Developers saw its potential to relieve the housing shortage San Diego was facing.

In 1974, a school bond issue was passed to help build the schools that the now full-fledged town of Mira Mesa sorely needed.  On September 13, 1976, Mira Mesa Jr./Sr. High School was opened and now serves grades 9-12, fed by the local Challenger and Wangenheim Middle Schools.

Since 1998, Mira Mesa High School has seen an increase in diversity among its students. As of the 2014–15 school year, the student body was composed at around 28% Filipino, 22% Hispanic, and 14% White.

In the spring of 2016 the school was re-accredited for another six years by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).

Starting in 2019 major construction projects started on campus, including a new building replacing the bungalow units, and a new music building in the front of the school.
