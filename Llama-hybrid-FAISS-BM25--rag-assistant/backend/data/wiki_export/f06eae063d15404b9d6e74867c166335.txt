Gustavo França Borges (born December 2, 1972) is a Brazilian former competitive swimmer. He swam for Brazil in the Summer Olympic Games in: 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004. Borges has won the second-most Olympic medals of any Brazilian, with fourone in 1992, two in 1996 and one in 2000behind sailors Robert Scheidt and Torben Grael. He also has the third-most Pan American Games gold medals of any Brazilian, with eightbehind swimmer Thiago Pereira and table tennis player Hugo Hoyama. Borges was Brazil's flagbearer for the Closing Ceremony at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Borges' first medal was silver, which he won in the 100-meter freestyle at the 1992 Olympics, which he received after a delay because his lane's timer was not working, and the judges had to review video recordings of the race to verify his place. Borges even overcame his idol, Matt Biondi, to win the silver medal.

Borges lives in São Paulo, where he runs his own swimming school. He used to live in the United States in Jacksonville, Florida and in Ann Arbor, Michigan while he was still a student. He attended university at the University of Michigan in the mid-1990s, where he swam for the university's team, coached by Jon Urbanchek and graduated with a degree in Economics. His teammates at Michigan included Eric Namesnik and Marcel Wouda in the mid-1990s.

Beginning 
Borges was born in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil, but lived in Ituverava throughout his childhood. In 1981, at the age of nine, he represented his school, coming third place in a race of 50-meter freestyle, his first podium finish. Before this, he had participated in swimming lessons at Associação Atlética Ituveravense. In 1984, in São João da Boa Vista, Gustavo won his first medal in official competitions in a 100-meter breaststroke race. Borges was a runner-up of the São Paulo state, and runner-up of the Teto Olímpico at breaststroke, category 11/12 years.

In 1987, Borges was 15 years old and swimming for the Associação Atlética Francana. He won the bronze medal in the 100-meter freestyle and silver in the 50-meter freestyle at the São Paulo Swimming Championship, Youth category A / B. In this year, Borges left Ituverava, moved to São Carlos and defended the São Carlos Clube. In 1988, at the São Paulo's Summer Youth Championship, he was a champion in the 50-meter freestyle and silver in the 100-meter freestyle. Borges' times were already good enough to participate in the Brazilian Championship, Júlio Delamare Trophy.

In 1991, Borges joined The Bolles School in Jacksonville and instantly became one of the top prep swimmers in the United States. He was the primary swimmer on Bolles' 1991 400 Freestyle Relay team that set a national high-school record with a 2:59.98. That relay, which broke the old national record by 1.70 seconds, would go on to be met with controversy in the coming years regarding its claim as the national mark. This was due to the fact that the Florida high-school season takes place in the fall, but the meet in which the record was set occurred at a prep school invitational in Philadelphia in February 1991. The relay would stand as the fastest-ever swam by a high-school team until 2012.
