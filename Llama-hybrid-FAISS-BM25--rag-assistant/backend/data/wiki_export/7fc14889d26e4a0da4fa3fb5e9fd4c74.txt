Overview

It is said that it was named after the word 'magus' (μάγος) which describes something magical and extremely beautiful. It is a wealthy, chic district and a prestigious place to live. Many similarities to Kifissia and Drafi can be found. Sainopouleio is located in Magoula, which is a famous open theatre where important festivals (ancient plays) are taking place. Sainopouleio was described by Manos Hadjidakis as the most beautiful theatre of Greece after the one in Epidaurus (Epidavros).
