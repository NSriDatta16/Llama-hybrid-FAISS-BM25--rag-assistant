Stereo is a studio album by the American band Vallejo, released in 2002.

"So Damn Beautiful" was covered by New Zealand singer Michael Murphy on his debut album, although the members of Vallejo were not initially credited as songwriters.

Critical reception
The Austin Chronicle wrote that Vallejo "has finally tipped the bottle all the way back and ingested the worm at the bottom ... their influences are now simply their sound, figuratively, not literally as with all young bands."
