Critical reception

The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that "a walloping beat defines every track, [Debora] Iyall's vocals are smoky and spirited and there are some wonky sax breaks throughout." The Wall Street Journal deemed Instincts "an album of polished, haunting music that lingers with you, like the aftertaste of cognac or the memory of a lover." The Globe and Mail praised Benjamin Bossi's "searing, jazz-tinged saxophone," writing that "the band sounds like nothing else that has gone before." Trouser Press concluded: "Mixing strength with beauty, Romeo Void makes very special dance music for the mind."
