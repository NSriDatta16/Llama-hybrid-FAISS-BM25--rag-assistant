More Music From the Motion Picture

On February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca released Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture. This CD contained additional 18 cuts from the film (including unused tracks and remixes of earlier scores, such as "Now We Are Free"). Many tracks also use dialogue from the movie, such as Maximus Decimus Meridius' quote "Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife... and I will have my vengeance."

Special Anniversary Edition

For the film's 5-year anniversary, a double CD edition was released combining the two previous editions.

Musical impact

Hans Zimmer's style influenced many composers, who used elements like female wailing vocals and the "battle waltz" for ancient war movies that followed.

Harry Gregson-Williams, a member of Zimmer's own Media Ventures Productions, relayed scoring duties for Ridley Scott's later film, Kingdom of Heaven.

In April 2006, a law firm representing the Holst Foundation filed a lawsuit claiming that Zimmer had infringed the copyright of Gustav Holst's The Planets. "The Battle" from the score was claimed to infringe the copyright on "Mars, the bringer of war". The Track "Barbarian Horde" reprises most of these themes.

Film music critics noted that the score also borrows from works by Richard Wagner, particularly themes from Siegfried and Götterdämmerung, included in the latter half of "The Might of Rome" and "Am I Not Merciful?"

In 2003 Luciano Pavarotti released the song "Il gladiatore" from his album Ti Adoro. The song was based on a theme from the score, featured on the soundtrack as track 4, "Earth". Pavarotti told Billboard magazine that he was meant to sing this song in the film, "But I said no then. Too bad. It's a magnificent song and a tough movie. Still, there is so much drama in just the song."

The "Il gladiatore" version of this song was performed by Andrea Bocelli during the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final in Rome, where FC Barcelona defeated Manchester United F.C. and also during the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final in Milan, where Real Madrid C.F. was proclaimed Champion of Europe when defeating the Club Atlético de Madrid.
