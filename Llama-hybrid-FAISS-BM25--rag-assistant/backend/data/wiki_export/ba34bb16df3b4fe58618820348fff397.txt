The following tables compare general and technical information for a number of file systems.

General information

Metadata

Features

File capabilities

Block capabilities
Note that in addition to the below table, block capabilities can be implemented below the file system layer in Linux (LVM, , cryptsetup) or Windows (Volume Shadow Copy Service, SECURITY), etc.

Resize capabilities
"online" and "offline" are synonymous with "mounted" and "not mounted".

Allocation and layout policies

OS support

Limits 

While storage devices usually have their size expressed in powers of 10 (for instance a 1 TB Solid State Drive will contain at least 1,000,000,000,000 (1012, 10004) bytes), filesystem limits are invariably powers of 2, so usually expressed with IEC prefixes. For instance, a 1 TiB limit means 240, 10244 bytes. Approximations (rounding down) using power of 10 are also given below to clarify.
