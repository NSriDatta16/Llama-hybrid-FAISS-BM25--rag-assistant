History 
From 2005 to 2019, the facility was named the Eastern Kentucky Expo Center, however in June 2019 naming rights were sold to Appalachian Wireless, as part of a 5-year, $85,000/year contract.

On October 22, 2022, the Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball played the annual Blue-White intra-squad scrimmage, normally held at Rupp Arena at Appalachian Wireless Arena to raise money for relief due to the 2022 Eastern Kentucky floods.  The event raised over $160,000.
