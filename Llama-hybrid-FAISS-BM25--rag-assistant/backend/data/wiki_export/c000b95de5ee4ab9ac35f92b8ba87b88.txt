Souf (سوف) is a town in Jerash Governorate, Jordan, set over a series of mountains at an altitude of 1,000 meters. Souf is situated 35 miles north of Amman, the capital of Jordan. The total population of Souf exceeds 14,000 people, while it covers a wide area of agricultural land, considered the widest in Jerash.

For many centuries, Souf was the centre of al-Meradh region; which has been called المعراض in Arabic, because it defeated Bedouins used to attack on north Jordan during the 19th century. Later, this region was the base for the governorate of Jerash which was created according to the kingdom's new administrative divisions. A number of villages are considered an extension of the old town of Souf including: Kufr Khall, Balila, Thughretasfour, Jaba, Zagreet, Majar, and Megbleh. Recently, Souf has been attached to greater city of Jerash due to its proximity to the new city.
