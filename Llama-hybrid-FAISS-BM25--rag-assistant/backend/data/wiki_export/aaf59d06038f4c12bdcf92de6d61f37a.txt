Mommy Don't Love Daddy Anymore is the fourth album by American Christian rock band Resurrection Band, released in 1981.

Recording history
Resurrection Band's move toward a more pop-influenced hard rock sound is solidified on this release, which in many ways is a continuation of the lyrical themes and musical sounds first expressed on Colours.  A small hint of the band's future incorporation of new wave keyboard stylings can also be heard on the closing track, "Lovin' You."

Once again, social issues ("Elevator Muzik" humorously trashes American materialism, "The Chair" addresses the plight of paraplegics, and the title track deals with the destructive effects of divorce on children), spiritual struggles ("The Crossing," "Alienated" and "Can't Do It on My Own") and evangelistic challenges to the listener ("First Degree Apathy" and "Stark/Spare") dominate the songs on the record.  Along with Colours and Awaiting Your Reply, Mommy Don't Love Daddy Anymore is considered by many music critics to be among Resurrection Band's finest work, and was immediately recognized as such by the leading alternative Christian music magazine at the time, Harvest Rock Syndicate, which awarded the album five stars.

This album was re-released in 2005 by Retroactive Records.
