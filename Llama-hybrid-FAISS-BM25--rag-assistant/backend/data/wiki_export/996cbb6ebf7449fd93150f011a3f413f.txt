San Nicolaas () is  southeast of Oranjestad, and is Aruba's second largest city.  it has a population of 15,283, most of whom originate from the British Caribbean and rest of the Caribbean.

History
According to oral tradition, San Nicolaas was named after a Mr. Nicolaas van der Biest (1808–1873), who owned a big piece of the land there.  Landowners were then addressed by their subordinates by their first names preceded by 'Shon' meaning 'master'.  So he was called 'Shon Nicolaas', as was the area.  It is thought that the change from Shon Nicolas to San Nicolaas was due to the influence of Spanish. 

Many Afro-Arubans settled in San Nicolaas during the 1920s, attracted by the many jobs associated with the oil refinery.

Oil Refinery 
Known as the island's Sunrise Side, San Nicolaas was once a bustling company town, when Lago Oil and Transport Company opened its oil refinery in 1924 until 1985 when Exxon Corporation closed it and began to dismantle the facility as well as the Colony.  In 1991  Coastal Corporation reopened the oil refinery until 1995.  It was then sold to Valero in 2004, and it was open for a number of years, and closed in 2009. In December 2010, Valero announced plans to reopen the refinery. The refinery later was purchased by Citgo Petroleum Corporation, which transferred the property to the Government of Aruba in 2020. As of July 2021, plans to build a modern facility on the site had not gone forward.
