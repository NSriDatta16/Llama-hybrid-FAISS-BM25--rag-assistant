The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-164) amended the Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969.  It can be found in the United States Code under Title 30, Mineral Lands and Mining, Chapter 22, Mine Safety and Health.

The S. 717 legislation was passed by the 95th United States Congressional session and enacted into law by the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter on November 9, 1977. S. 717 was drafted largely by Mike Goldberg of the Senate Labor Committee staff and James H. Rathlesberger, the special assistant in the Office of the Secretary of the Interior who oversaw the Mine Health and Safety Administration (MESA) until the bill transferred it to the Labor Department.   

The law of the United States enacted on November 9, 1977 took effect one hundred and twenty days later.  It had been supported by the United Mine Workers, Carter Administration and others but opposed by the mining industry.
