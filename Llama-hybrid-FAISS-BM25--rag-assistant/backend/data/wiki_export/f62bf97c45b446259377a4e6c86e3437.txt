The Rotters' Club is a 2001 novel by British author Jonathan Coe. It is set in Birmingham during the 1970s, and inspired by the author's experiences at King Edward's School, Birmingham. The title is taken from the album The Rotters' Club by experimental rock band Hatfield and the North. The book was followed by two sequels.

The book contains one of the longest sentences in English literature, with 13,955 words. The Rotters' Club was inspired by Bohumil Hrabal's Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age: a Czech language novel that consisted of one great sentence.

Adaptation 
In 2003, a four-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation written by Simon Littlefield was broadcast with David Tennant playing the part of Bill Anderton and Frank Skinner as Sam Trotter. In early 2005, a three-part television adaptation written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais was broadcast on BBC Two, starring Geoff Breton as Ben Trotter, Nicholas Shaw as Doug Anderton, Peter Bankole as Steve Richards, and Rasmus Hardiker as Phillip Chase.

The UK indie band Neils Children featured as the band playing at the 'live' concert in the programme. The song used was one of their own, after the band turned down the song supplied by the musical director of the show.

Reception 
In a 2002 review, The New York Times praised The Rotters' Club as "richly constructed and brilliantly ornamented." The Daily Telegraph characterized the book as an "ambitious... moving, richly comic novel," according to the publisher's website. A review in The Guardian was more ambivalent, critiquing Coe's tendency to introduce larger social and political issues into a coming-of-age story, arguing that various characters "undergo rites of passage that make no difference."

Sequels 
Coe has published two sequels to the book. The Closed Circle picked up the characters' lives at the very end of the 1990s. Middle England opens in 2010 and addresses issues such as Brexit, Donald Trump and climate change.

Influence
The British Punk band The Rotters named themselves after the novel. The band was known for featuring a young Faris Badwan on drums.
