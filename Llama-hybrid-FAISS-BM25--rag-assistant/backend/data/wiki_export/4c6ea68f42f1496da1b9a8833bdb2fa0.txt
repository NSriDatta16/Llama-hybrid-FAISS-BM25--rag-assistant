Route 161 is a north/south highway south of the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Canada. Its current northern terminus is at Autoroute 20 in Sainte-Eulalie, just east of the junction of Autoroute 55, while its southern terminus is at the border of Maine in the USA, where it continues as Maine State Route 27. Previously the highway continued to Route 155 in Saint-Célestin, but that section was decommissioned in 2006 when Autoroute 55 was completed.

On July 6, 2013, the route was severed at Lac-Mégantic, Quebec by an oil train derailment.  Ministry of Transport consultants began surveying a site for a new bridge across the Chaudière River in August 2013.
