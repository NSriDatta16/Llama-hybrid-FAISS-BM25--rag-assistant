Alfred William Savary,  (10 October 1831 – 30 March 1920) served as a Nova Scotia member of the 1st Canadian Parliament for the Digby riding.

Savary was born in Plympton, Nova Scotia, the son of Sabine Savary and Olivia Marshall, and was educated at King's College in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He was called to the New Brunswick bar in 1857 and to the Nova Scotia bar in July 1861. Savary practised law in Digby, Nova Scotia. He was also editor of the New Brunswicker. In 1872, he was named Queen's Counsel. Savary was married twice: to Bessie Crookshank Otty in 1877 and to Eliza Theresa Hunt in 1892.

Savary ran unsuccessfully for the Digby seat in the Nova Scotia assembly in 1863.

He was elected under the Anti-Confederation Party banner to the new Canadian Parliament in 1867, but became a Conservative in 1869. He won re-election to the 2nd Canadian Parliament in 1872, but was defeated in the following election in 1874.

Savary was the author of:
 A genealogical and biographical record of the Savery families (Savory and Savary) and of the Severy family (Severit, Savery, Savory and Savary) ... published in 1893
