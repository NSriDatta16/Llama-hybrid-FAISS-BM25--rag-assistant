Administrative Zone 3 is a former administrative subdivision of the Ethiopian Region of Gambela. This zone was bordered by Sudan on the south, west and north, by Administrative Zone 1 on the east and Administrative Zone 2 on the southeast; the Pibor defines the border on the south and west, while the Baro defines it for the northern border. Towns in this zone included Tergol and Telut. Most of the area of this zone was added to Nuer Zone and some parts were added to Anuak Zone.

The economy of Akobo was predominantly agricultural. There are no agricultural cooperatives, no documented roads, and little other infrastructure. Both Jikawo and Akobo woredas are flooded during the rainy season, requiring the people to migrate to the highlands with their cattle until the waters recede; thus raising livestock is the primary source of income in this Zone.4407
