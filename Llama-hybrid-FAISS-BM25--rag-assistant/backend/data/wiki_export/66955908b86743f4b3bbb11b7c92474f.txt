Langwith-Whaley Thorns railway station is in Derbyshire, England. The station is on the Robin Hood Line 22¼ miles (36 km) north of Nottingham towards Worksop.

This station serves the villages of Nether Langwith and Whaley Thorns which are both on the boundary of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. It also serves the village of Langwith in Derbyshire.

The Robin Hood Line was opened to reinstate a Nottingham to Worksop service, which ran from 1875 until it was withdrawn in October 1964. After withdrawal the station at Langwith was razed to the ground. When the Robin Hood service was being planned it was decided that, rather than build a new station on the original site in Langwith Maltings, the community would be better served by building the new station about half a mile further North in the larger communities of Nether Langwith and Whaley Thorns. The "old" Langwith station is described at Langwith station (1875-1964).
