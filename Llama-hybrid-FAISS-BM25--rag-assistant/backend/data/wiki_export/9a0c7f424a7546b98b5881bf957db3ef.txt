Progress Publishers was a Moscow-based Soviet publisher founded in 1931.

Publishing program
Progress Publishers published books in a variety of languages: Russian, English, and many other European and Asian languages. They issued many scientific books, books on arts, political books (especially on Marxismâ€“Leninism), classic books, children's literature, novels and short fiction, books in source languages for people studying foreign languages, guidebooks and photographic albums.

Progress Publishers joined with International Publishers in New York and the Communist Party of Great Britain's publishing house, Lawrence and Wishart, in London to publish the 50-volume Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, a project launched in 1975 and completed only in 2004.

Other books published in English by Progress included Marx and Engels on the United States (1979), a compilation drawn from letters, articles, and various other works, and A Short History of the USSR (1984).

One of the common features of all Progress books was their "request to reader" to send an opinion and suggestions on the book. It reads:
