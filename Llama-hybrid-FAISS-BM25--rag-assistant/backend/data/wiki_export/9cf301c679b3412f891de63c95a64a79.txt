The 15th Artistic Gymnastics World Championships were held on July 3â€“8, 1962 in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, this being the 3rd time that Prague hosted these championships.

These were the last championships China competed in until 1979. Following a 1964 vote to accept Taiwan as a member nation, China withdrew from the International Gymnastics Federation in protest. They would not rejoin until 1978.
