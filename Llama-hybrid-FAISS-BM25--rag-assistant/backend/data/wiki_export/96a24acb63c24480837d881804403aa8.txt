Road Kill is a pair of live albums released by Celtic rock band Seven Nations in 1998.  According to the band, the discs were meant to portray the band's live act realistically, and to preserve "the intensity and energy that make our concerts so much fun both for us and our audiences." The band's lineup at the time was as follows:

Kirk McLeod: vocals, guitars, keyboards, highland bagpipes
Struby: bass guitar, vocals
Ashton Geoghagan: drums, percussion
Neil Anderson: highland and uilleann bagpipes, Scottish smallpipes

The Road Kill albums were the last Seven Nations releases before the departure of primary bagpipe player Neil Anderson, who had been a member of the band since its inception and was largely responsible for the band's Celtic influences (Anderson sang lead vocals on many traditional Celtic songs the band performed, such as "Whiskey in the Jar" and "The Pound a Week Rise," whereas McLeod would typically sing original compositions).  They were also the last two of Seven Nations' independently released albums, all of which are now out of print.  However, a cassette version of Road Kill Volume II is still in stock on the band's web site. Digital copies may be obtained from online sites.
