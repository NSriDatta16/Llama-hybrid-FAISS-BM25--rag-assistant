History 

Poduene was first mentioned in 1453 as Poduyani. The name is derived from the word poduy, an adjective from pod ("soil") with the now-unproductive suffix â€“uy. In that case poduy was a geographical term referring to a high flat country or a plain country at the foot of a hill.

Poduene was the first village to be included within the city of Sofia in 1895 and was mentioned in the Elin Pelin works. In 1920s the neighbourhoods of Suha Reka and Hadzhi Dimitar were established and experienced a quick population growth mainly from north-western Bulgaria. Many streets are still named after villages from the region such as Gintsi, Todorini Kukli, Petrohan and others.

During socialism (1944-1989) Poduene along with two other districts (Oborishte and Slatina) formed the 5th district "Vasil Levski" of the capital. In the 1960s, 1970s and especially 1980s many panel blocks were constructed in the neighbourhoods of Suha Reka, Hadzhi Dimitar, Poduene and Stefan Karadzha. In the end of the 1980s a new neighbourhood Metalurg was built and in 1999 it was renamed to Levski V and G after its incorporation into Poduene from Kremikovtsi.
