Roberto Cabañas González (11 April 1961 – 9 January 2017) was a Paraguayan footballer who played as a forward.

Career
During his career, Cabañas played for Cerro Porteño of Paraguay, Stade Brestois and Olympique Lyonnais of France, the New York Cosmos (winning the 1980 and 1982 NASL championship and top scorer and NASL MVP in 1983), América de Cali of Colombia (helping the team in reaching three consecutive Copa Libertadores finals) and Boca Juniors of Argentina (winning the 1992 Apertura tournament and the 1992 Copa Master de Supercopa).

After representing Paraguay at the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship, Cabañas became a key player of the Paraguay national team during the 1980s. Cabañas was not only pivotal in Paraguay's qualification for the Mexico 1986 World Cup, but he also scored the two goals against Belgium in the pivotal third group match, thus tying the game at 2-2. This allowed Paraguay to qualify second in their group, behind Mexico.

After retiring, Cabañas settled in Cali, Colombia, where he married and had two children.

Cabañas died of a heart attack in Asunción in January 2017, Paraguay. He was 55.
