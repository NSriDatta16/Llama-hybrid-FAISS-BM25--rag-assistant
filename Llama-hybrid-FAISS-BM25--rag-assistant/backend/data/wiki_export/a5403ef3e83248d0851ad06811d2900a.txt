Professor Molchanov is an Akademik Shuleykin-class ice-strengthened vessel, built in Finland for the Soviet Union. Launched on 28 December 1982, she was named after Pavel Molchanov, radiosonde inventor, on his 90th anniversary. Between 26 January 1983 and 7 September 1991, the ship was used for polar and oceanographic research. She made 34 research cruises as a Soviet research vessel, including three global hydrology expeditions held by Murmansk Hydrometeorological Administration:
28 April 1984 - 10 June 1984, through North Sea, Norwegian Sea, north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, Barents Sea

Since 2012, annual expeditions have been conducted on board the ship within the framework of the Northern (Arctic) Federal University Floating University project.
