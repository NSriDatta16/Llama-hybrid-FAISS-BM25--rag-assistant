Anjuna () is a village located on the coast of North Goa, India. It is a Census Town, one of the twelve Brahmin comunidades of Bardez. It is mostly a tourist destination.

Its church, St. Michael's Church, Anjuna, founded in 1595, is dedicated to S. Miguel, and celebrates the feasts of S. Miguel (29 September) and Nossa Senhora Advogada (second week of January).

History 

Like all of Goa, Anjuna was long held by the Portuguese.  In 1950, it had a population of 5,688  and, in 2011, it had 9,636.

Historian Teresa Albuquerque reports that the village's name is derived from the Arabic word 'Hanjuman' (meaning Merchant Guild). Others say it comes from an Arabic word for "change" - as people used to arrive at Anjuna from the sea looking to change money.

It became a destination on the hippie trail during the late 1960s.
