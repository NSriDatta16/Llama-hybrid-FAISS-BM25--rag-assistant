WTJP-TV (channel 60) is a television station licensed to Gadsden, Alabama, United States, serving the Birmingham area as an owned-and-operated station of the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). The station's transmitter is located on Blount Mountain near Springville, Alabama.

The station formerly operated from a studio located on Rosedale Avenue in Gadsden. That facility was one of several closed by TBN in 2019 following the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s abolition of the "Main Studio Rule", which required full-service television stations like WTJP-TV to maintain facilities in or near their communities of license.

History
The station first signed on the air on July 22, 1986, and was built and signed on by All American TV (not to be confused with an unrelated television syndication company of a similar name), a minority-owned firm with close ties to the Trinity Broadcasting Network; all of All American's stations were TBN affiliates. TBN acquired the All American group outright, including WTJP, in 2000.

Technical information

Subchannels

Analog-to-digital conversion
WTJP-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 60, on April 16, 2009, ahead of the official June 12 date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 26. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 60, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

Former translators
WTJP-TV's signal was formerly relayed on low-power translator stations W51BY (channel 51) in Jasper and W46BU (channel 46) in Tuscaloosa; the latter station went silent on April 13, 2010, due to declining support, which was attributed to the digital transition.
