History 
The village was founded in the 17th century, during the Plantation of Ulster, by Sir Toby Poyntz. He was the son of Lieutenant Charles Poyntz, who, for his military services, obtained a  grant of land that had been confiscated from the O'Hanlons by the English. The Irish called the area An Chora Uachtarach, meaning "the upper weir". Before it was named Acton, the townland was known as Curryotragh. There he built a bawn  square, a house of brick and lime for himself, and 24 cottages for some English settlers. The Poyntz family were anciently feudal barons of Curry Mallet in Somerset, England, later of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire, after which Acton, County Armagh, was named. By 1837, the village contained about 50 houses "indifferently built".
