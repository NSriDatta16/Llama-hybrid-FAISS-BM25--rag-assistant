The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) is the umbrella body for the voluntary and community sector in England. It is a registered charity (no 225922). NCVO works to support the voluntary and community sector and to create an environment in which an independent civil society can flourish. NCVO has a membership of more than 14,000 voluntary organisations. These range from large national bodies to community groups, volunteer centres, and development agencies working at a local level.

Location
NCVO's headquarters are in the King's Cross, London area at Society Building, 8 All Saints Street, London N1 9RL.

Aims
NCVO aims to:

 champion volunteering and the voluntary sector
 strengthen voluntary organisations
 grow and enhance volunteering, wherever it takes place
 connect people and organisations
 be a sustainable and socially responsible organisation

Activity
NCVO represents the views of its members, and the wider voluntary sector to government, the European Union and other bodies. It carries out research into, and analysis of, the voluntary and community sector. It campaigns on issues affecting the whole of the voluntary and community sector, such as the role of voluntary and community organisations in public service delivery and the future of local government. It provides information, advice and support to other organisations and individuals working in or with the voluntary and community sector.
Many now well-established voluntary organisations started out as projects within NCVO, including Age Concern, Citizens Advice, the Charities Aid Foundation, the Black Environment Network, the Youth Hostel Association and the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs.

In July 2019, NCVO's charity tax commission, chaired by Nicholas Montagu, issued a report calling for the overhaul of tax reliefs to UK charities.

History
NCVO started in 1919 as the National Council of Social Service (NCSS).  NCSS was established in order to bring various voluntary bodies together and into closer relationships with government departments. Its foundation was made possible through a legacy from Edward Vivian Birchall, who had played a large part in the emergent voluntary sector before he was killed, aged 32, in France during the First World War.

On 1 April 1980, just over 60 years since its foundation, the National Council of Social Service became the National Council for Voluntary Organisations.

On 1 January 2013, NCVO merged with Volunteering England (which itself had recently merged  with Student Volunteering England).

The organisation's first headquarters (from 1928 to 1992) were at 26 Bedford Square, London WC1.
