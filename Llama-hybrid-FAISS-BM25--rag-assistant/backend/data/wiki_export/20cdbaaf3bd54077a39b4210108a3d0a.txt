Return to CSKA Sofia
On 7 June 2012, Yanev signed a contract with former club CSKA Sofia. Yanev's second stay at CSKA turned out to be short-lived, as he was released from the club in the summer of 2012 following the team's elimination from the UEFA Europa League by Slovenian club Mura 05.

International career

On 18 August he made his debut, replacing Marian Hristov as a second-half substitute in a 1–1 friendly draw against Ireland at Lansdowne Road Stadium.
