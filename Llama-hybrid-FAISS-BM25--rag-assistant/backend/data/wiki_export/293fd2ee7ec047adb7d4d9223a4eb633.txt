The Basic Points Unifying the Theravāda and the Mahāyāna  is an important Buddhist ecumenical statement created in 1967 during the First Congress of the World Buddhist Sangha Council (WBSC), where its founder Secretary-General, the late Venerable Pandita Pimbure Sorata Thera, requested the Ven. Walpola Rahula to present a concise formula for the unification of all the different Buddhist traditions. This text was then unanimously approved by the council.

Text of the original document 

{{cquote|
 The Buddha is our only Master (teacher and guide)
 We take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the  (the Three Jewels)
 We do not believe that this world is created and ruled by a God.
 We consider that the purpose of life is to develop compassion for all living beings without discrimination and to work for their good, happiness, and peace; and to develop wisdom (prajñā) leading to the realization of Ultimate Truth We accept the Four Noble Truths, namely , the arising of , the cessation of , and the path leading to the cessation of ; and the law of cause and effect (pratītyasamutpāda) All conditioned things () are impermanent (anitya) and , and that all conditioned and unconditioned things (dharma) are without self (anātma) (see trilaksana). We accept the thirty-seven qualities conducive to enlightenment () as different aspects of the Path taught by the Buddha leading to Enlightenment. There are three ways of attaining bodhi or Enlightenment: namely as a disciple (śrāvaka), as a pratyekabuddha and as a samyaksambuddha (perfectly and fully enlightened Buddha). We accept it as the highest, noblest, and most heroic to follow the career of a Bodhisattva and to become a samyaksambuddha in order to save others. We admit that in different countries there are differences regarding Buddhist beliefs and practices. These external forms and expressions should not be confused with the essential teachings of the Buddha.}}
