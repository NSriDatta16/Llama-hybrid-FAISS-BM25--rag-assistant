The News Line is a daily newspaper published by a British Trotskyist group, the Workers' Revolutionary Party.

History
The paper was launched in 1969 as Workers Press and renamed News Line in 1976.

For a time during the 1980s, the WRP split into two rival factions, and for a short time there were two versions of The News Line being produced every day, one by each faction.

Chris Hughton wrote a football column for the newspaper in the 1970s.
