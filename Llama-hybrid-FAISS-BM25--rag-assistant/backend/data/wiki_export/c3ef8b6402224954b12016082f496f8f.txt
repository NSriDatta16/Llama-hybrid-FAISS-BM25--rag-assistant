Teluk Bayur (Minangkabau: Taluak Bayua) formerly known as Emma Haven or Emmahaven is a port located in Bayur Bay of Padang city, West Sumatra, Indonesia. The port, the largest and busiest on the western coast of Sumatra, is operated by the government owned company PT. (Persero) Pelabuhan Indonesia II (Indonesia Port Corporation II).

The port was originally built in 1888 by the Dutch colonial government. On April 29, 2013 a new container terminal was officially opened by West Sumatra Governor Irwan Prayitno that can handle more than 4,000 containers in a 46,886 square-meter area.

Renovation
The renovation project, which ran from 2011 to 2015 with a cost of Rp1.7 trillion ($185.8 million), changed the conventional face of Teluk Bayur Port into a modern one. The new port will reduce the time ships have to queue from an average of 10 days to a reasonable time with 3 separated berths to handle containers and bulk goods. A multi-purpose terminal and container terminal will also be expanded from 150 meters to 500 meters with 7 cranes, so 16 large-scale ships can dock at the same time, rising from its current capacity of 10 ships.
