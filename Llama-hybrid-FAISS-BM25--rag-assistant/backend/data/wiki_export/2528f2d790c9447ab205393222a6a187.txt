Colorado's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Colorado based primarily in the City and County of Denver in the central part of the state. The district includes all of the City and County of Denver, and the Denver enclaves of Glendale and Holly Hills.

The district has been represented by Democrat Diana DeGette since 1997. An urban and diverse district based in the heart of Metropolitan Denver and with a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of D+29, it is the most Democratic district in both Colorado and the Mountain West. Only two Republicans have been elected to the seat since the Great Depression: Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947; and Mike McKevitt from 1971 to 1973, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats. No Republican has even notched 30% of the vote in the district after 1998.
