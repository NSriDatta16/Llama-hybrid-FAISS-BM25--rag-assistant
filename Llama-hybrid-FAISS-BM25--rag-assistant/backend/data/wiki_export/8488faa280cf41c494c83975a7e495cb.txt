The Convent of Jesus and Mary, Delhi, India, or CJM, is a girls day school in Delhi, India. Established in 1919, it is one of a network of Convents of Jesus and Mary in India and the UK.

History

The school was  founded in 1919 by the order of the Religious of Jesus and Mary, a Roman Catholic congregation, in Lyon, France, in October, 1818, by Claudine Th√©venet (Mary of St. Ignatius). It moved to its current building behind the Sacred Heart Cathedral in 1926.

It has 2,000 students and is the alma mater of several eminent women in or from India. Situated near the Gol Dak Khana (Round Post Office), its grounds border the St. Columba's School (for boys). As a result, these are considered "sister and brother schools" and many students have siblings in the other school.

The school's motto is , which is Latin for "Praised be forever Jesus and Mary".

In India it is categorized as a minority school and starts from nursery going up to class 12.
