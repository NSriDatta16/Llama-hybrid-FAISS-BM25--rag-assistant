Patrice Lauzon (born November 26, 1975) is a Canadian ice dancing coach and former competitor. With his wife Marie-France Dubreuil, he is a two-time (2006–2007) World silver medalist.

Personal life 
Patrice Lauzon was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Cecile and Norman Lauzon. He married Marie-France Dubreuil in August 2008. On December 24, 2010, Dubreuil gave birth to their daughter, Billie-Rose.

Competitive career 
Lauzon initially took figure skating classes to improve his hockey skating. He took up ice dancing at the age of twelve. Early in his career, he competed with Marisa Gravino and Chantal Lefebvre.

In 1995, Lauzon teamed up with Marie-France Dubreuil and they placed 6th at their first Canadian Championships. They took the silver medal in their first appearance at Four Continents in 2000. Their coaches were Sylvie Fullum and François Vallee, who retired after the 2001–02 season. Dubreuil/Lauzon then decided to move permanently to Lyon, France, to train under Muriel Boucher-Zazoui.

Dubreuil/Lauzon captured the gold medal at the Canadian National Championships five times and competed at the Winter Olympics twice. They were forced to withdraw from the 2006 Winter Olympics after Dubreuil suffered an injury. They recovered to win the silver medal at the 2006 World Championships in Calgary, Alberta.

Dubreuil/Lauzon began the 2006–07 season with gold medals at 2006 Skate Canada International and 2006 NHK Trophy, which qualified them for the Grand Prix Final. At the World Championships in Tokyo, they took their second consecutive World silver medal.
