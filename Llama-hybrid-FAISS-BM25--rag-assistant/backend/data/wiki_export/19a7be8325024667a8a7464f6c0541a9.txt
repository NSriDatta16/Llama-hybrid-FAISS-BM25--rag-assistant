Harold Q. Masur (January 29, 1909 in New York City â€“ September 16, 2005 in Boca Raton, Florida) was an American lawyer and author of mystery novels, most of them featuring his lawyer character, Scott Jordan, who behaved like a private eye, similar to Perry Mason

He graduated from the New York University School of Law in 1934 and practiced law between 1935 and 1942. He then went on to join the U.S. Air Force. In the late 1940s he started writing short mystery stories for the pulps, while simultaneously beginning his career as a novelist. In 1973 he was elected President of the Mystery Writers of America.
