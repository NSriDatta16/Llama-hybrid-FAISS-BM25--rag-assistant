The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) is commonly used as a reliability index by electric power utilities.  SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and is calculated as:

where  is the number of customers and  is the annual outage time for location , and  is the total number of customers served. In other words,

SAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.50 hours.

Comparison of SAIDI by country 
The following is a table of SAIDI for different countries, calculated using the methodology in the World Bank's Doing Business 2016-2020 studies:
