Club career

Bristol City
Born in Bristol, Golbourne joined his Bristol City's youth system in 2002, at age 15, after winning a scholarship to the club's academy. He began his career within the youth system as a left-sided midfielder. After four years in the youth system, Golbourne made his first-team debut for Bristol City in a 2–0 victory over Colchester United, coming on for Luke Wilkshire in the 72nd minute.

However, after two seasons with the club, Golbourne left his hometown club for Reading in January 2006 for an undisclosed fee.

Reading
Less than 24 hours after a transfer to Reading, Golbourne made his reserves debut for the Royals in a 6–0 rout of Millwall's reserves. Golbourne was awarded the League One Apprentice of the Year Award in March 2006 for his actions on the pitch, as well as his educational achievements. On 17 April, after several months in reserves, he made his Reading first-team debut—a 3–1 win over Stoke City.

After only two appearances in two seasons, Golbourne was made available for a loan by Reading boss Steve Coppell. On 16 August 2006, he was loaned to League Two club Wycombe Wanderers for one month. He was immediately made available for the first-team squad, making his debut on 19 August in a 3–0 victory over Bury. Just days before his initial return to Reading, Golbourne extended his stay at Adams Park with a two-month loan extension, after making four appearances for the Blues in his original loan deal. On 25 August 2006, despite a 3–1 loss to Lincoln City, Golbourne was named Man of the Match by the game's sponsor for his efforts in defence and midfield. His first ever league goal came on 18 November 2006, in a 1–1 draw with Grimsby Town. However, the goal came in Golbourne's final match on his loan to Wycombe, as he returned to Reading just days later. Within several days of his return to Reading, he was immediately loaned back to Wycombe on a loan deal which lasted until the end of the 2006–07 season, immediately making his way back into the starting line-up in a 1–0 win over Chester City.

On 25 August 2007, Golbourne made his Premier League debut for Reading, in a 3–0 loss to Bolton Wanderers. However, he was subbed off the 63rd minute for Bobby Convey. Three days later, he featured in Reading's 1–0 win over Swansea City, coming on in extra time in the 99th minute.

After his return to Reading, Golbourne was again loaned out in November 2007, when he joined League One club AFC Bournemouth on a month's loan. On 6 November, he made his Bournemouth debut in a 3–1 defeat to Leeds United. His first goal for Bournemouth, and the third of his career, came on 20 November in a 3–2 FA Cup victory over Barrow, when he netted the opening goal in the 43rd minute.

Exeter City
Golbourne signed for Exeter City on 2 July after agreeing a one-year contract with the newly promoted League One club. He ended speculation over his future by signing a new two-year contract with Exeter City in June 2010.

Barnsley
On 30 January 2012 Golbourne joined Championship side Barnsley on a two-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on 4 February, scoring a consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat to Watford. He became a regular first team player for the club, but missed the final months of the 2012–13 season with a knee injury. In total he made 53 appearances for the club during an eighteen-month stay.

Wolverhampton Wanderers

On 30 August 2013 Golbourne moved to Wolverhampton Wanderers of League One on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee (reportedly £700,000). He made his club debut on 31 August 2013 in a 3–1 win at Port Vale, and scored what to be his only goal for the club in a 3–2 win against Swindon in his second league appearance. Golbourne was an almost ever-present part of the Wolves team that ended the season as League One champions with a record points total for that level.

Back in the Championship, Golbourne remained a regular part of Wolves' plans but a foot injury hampered him throughout the 2014–15 season, restricting his appearances and his performance level. With only a year remaining on his contract, talks were opened but no negotiation reached by midpoint of the season when he fell out of the starting line-up and would be sold during the January 2016 window. In total he made 92 appearances for Wolves, scoring once.
