China Federation for Defending the Diaoyu Islands () is a non-governmental organization which maintains that the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands are a part of Chinese territory in the Senkaku Islands dispute. The territorial rights to the islands are disputed between the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China, and Japan, which currently has control over the islands.

In the early morning of March 24, 2004, seven activists from the group landed on the islands, planning to stay for several days.  That afternoon, they were detained by the Japanese coast guard. The incident gave the territorial dispute renewed media attention and worsened Sino-Japanese relations.
