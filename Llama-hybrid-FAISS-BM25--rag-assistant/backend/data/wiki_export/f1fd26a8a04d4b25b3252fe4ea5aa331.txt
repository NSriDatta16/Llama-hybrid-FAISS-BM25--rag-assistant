History 
The earliest stadium on this site was known the "St√§dtisches Stadion" and was opened on 29 May 1928. It was opened as a multi-purpose sports venue, featuring a playing field and an athletics track. 

After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the stadium was completely rebuilt in 1950 over a 4-month period. The stadium was opened on 20 August 1950 and was named "Otto Grotewohl Stadium", in honour of the then East German Prime Minister, Otto Grotewohl. Between 1986 and 1992, the stadium was subject to large-scale renovations, and the stadium was renamed to Erzgebirgsstadion in 1991. The stadium has since been redeveloped in 2010, and again in 2017.
