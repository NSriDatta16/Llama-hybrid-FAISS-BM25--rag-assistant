Killing Time is a dystopian novel by Caleb Carr set in the Mid-21st Century. It was initially serialized in TIME and later published in 2000 by Random House. It includes criticisms of the information age (see quotes below). The book was a departure for Carr, whose previous two novels (and his subsequent one) were crime thrillers set in the Victorian era.
