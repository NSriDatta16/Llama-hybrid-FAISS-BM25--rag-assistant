Cole decides to avenge Lynch and find out who killed him. His investigation leads to Tao, a former member and enemy of Grifter's team the Wildcats. Grifter is contacted by Holden Carver, a member of Tao's organisation, who turns out to be a sleeper agent. Lynch is the only one who knows about Carver's status as an agent and Carver hopes that Grifter can help him now Lynch is in a coma.

Grifter promises to bring in Carver, but returning to his room, he finds Tao. Tao tells Grifter that he had been under Tao's influence and that in fact Grifter himself was the one who shot Lynch. Tao then erases all memory of the past few days from Grifter's mind. Grifter returns to the bar to wait for Lynch, leaving Carver within Tao's organisation with no hope of extraction.
