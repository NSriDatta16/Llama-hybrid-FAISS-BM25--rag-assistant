Oblivion (stylized as ObLiViOn) was a punk rock group from the Chicago area.  The band was composed of Pete Kourim on bass guitar and lead vocals, Scott Ozark on guitar and back-up vocals, and Brian Czarnik on drums.

History 
The group started as a heavy metal cover band in 1988, but their style solidified to have more of a punk focus by the early 1990s.  During the late 90s, Oblivion had a strong following in the Chicago/Midwest punk scene.  Their musical stylings borrowed equal parts from punk, metal, and classic rock.  They released a number of 7"s and full-length albums primarily on Johann's Face Records, although they also released music on Dr. Strange, Underdog, and others.  Songs often commented on social interactions, stories about troubled girls, and relationship issues seen from a cryptic moody perspective.  The group sometimes made social commentary but mostly in an indirect and self-debasing way.  After more than a decade of playing together, the group disbanded.  They played a farewell show in March 2000.

Post-breakup 
 After the group disbanded, Brian moved to Florida and worked on a big cat (tigers/lions) sanctuary.  Scott played with the Nobs, while Pete continued to play in Mexican Cheerleader, a band that started while Oblivion still existed.

Reunion show
Oblivion played a reunion show on December 29, 2006 at the Abbey Pub in Chicago.  They performed with Apocalypse Hoboken.  This was the first show the band played in over five years.
