History

Turvânia began in 1930 with the establishment of a settlement called Poções, from the nearby stream.  The site originally had a cemetery called "por enquanto" (for the time being).  In 1943 land was donated to build a chapel and the first constructions and streets appeared.  In the beginning progress was difficult because of malaria, the lack of medicine and roads.  In 1958 it became a municipality with the name "Turvânia" because of the Turvo River that crosses the region.  Source:  Sepin
