Sterling Airport  is a public use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) southwest of the central business district of Sterling, a town in Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States. It is privately owned by Monadnock Realty Corp.

It is a fairly inexpensive place to rent airplanes, as the starting rate is $99/hour for a two-seater Cessna 150. The airport has many parking spaces, open-air and in hangars. The Sterling Airport closes its runways in early September for the Sterling Fair, during which time, all the aircraft tied down on the field must be flown elsewhere. Even the glider trailers are moved off-field. But after the fair, the airport opens for normal operations once again.

Sterling Airport is also the home of the Greater Boston Soaring Club.
