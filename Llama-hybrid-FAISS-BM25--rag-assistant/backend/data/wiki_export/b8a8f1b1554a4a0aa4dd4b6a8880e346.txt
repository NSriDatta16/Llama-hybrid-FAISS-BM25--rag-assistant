Dante Rafael López Fariña (born 16 August 1983 in Asunción) is a retired Paraguayan professional footballer.

López's good form with lowly club Crotone earned him a call up for Paraguay at the 2007 Copa America. His form attracted some interest of a few larger Italian clubs, including Napoli. However, López moved back to Paraguay to play for Libertad, after the relegation of Crotone from Serie B.

Zacatepec

On 9 June 2016, it was announced that Lopez along with Pumas teammate Ludueña would join Zacatepec in the Ascenso MX.
