Country Music News was a Canadian monthly periodical published in Ottawa by Larry Delaney and Joanne Delaney. It calls itself "The Voice Of Country Music in Canada".

Overview 
Country Music News was first published on 1 April 1980. The magazine, published monthly, was started with the name Capital Country News which was changed to Country Music News in 1982. Its mission was to provide Canadian country music artists, songwriters, and the industry with accurate and meaningful print media exposure in Canada and around the world. It was the only national print media serving Canadian country music artists and fans of the genre.

Country Music News established a string of reporters from across Canada, contributing monthly reports on the country music happenings in all parts of Canada. These regular columns were supported by a monthly Nashville country music report as well as in-depth CD reviews, feature articles, industry news, songwriter features, and a "Top 100 Cancountry Hit Chart". Print coverage was supported by dozens of exclusive photos of Canadian country music stars.

After publishing a total of 383 monthly issues Country Music News ceased publication in March 2012.
