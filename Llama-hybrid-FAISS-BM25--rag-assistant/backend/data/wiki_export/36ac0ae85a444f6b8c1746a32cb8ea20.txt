Mount Vernon railway station is a railway station located in the Mount Vernon area of Glasgow, Scotland. It is on the Whifflet Line (a branch of the more extensive Argyle Line),  east of Glasgow Central. Train services are provided by ScotRail.

History 
The Rutherglen and Coatbridge Railway opened a station on this site in 1866. It was closed to passengers in 1943, although the line through it remained open for passenger services until 1966. It was rebuilt and reopened as Mount Vernon on 4 October 1993 by British Rail.

Services

From 1993 
Following the electrification of the line in 2014, a half-hourly service has operated to and from  on Mondays to Saturdays. One train per hour each way is extended to/from Motherwell. There is also an all-year hourly service each way on Sundays for the first time since the line reopened in 1993 (Sunday services had previously operated only on the four weeks up to Christmas for shoppers). Prior to electrification, the service was operated by Class 156s and 158s, and ran to/from Glasgow Central High Level.
