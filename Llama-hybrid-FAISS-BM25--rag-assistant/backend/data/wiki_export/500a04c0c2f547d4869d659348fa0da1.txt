Colette Marie Trudeau (born June 17, 1985) is a Canadian born MÃ©tis singer-songwriter, best known as a vocalist for the band LiveonRelease.

LiveonRelease

LiveonRelease was founded by Colette Trudeau and Brittin Karroll, who had decided to form an all-female rock band at the age of 15. Colette used the Georgia Straight, an entertainment newspaper in Vancouver, to recruit the rest of the band: Foxx Herst and Leah Emmott. After doing small gigs, the band invited Vancouver rocker Bif Naked to an outdoor show, leading her to sign them to her label "Her Royal Majesty's Records", distributed through Warner Music Canada.

As lead singer, Colette co-wrote their hit single "I'm Afraid of Britney Spears" which appeared in the movie and soundtrack for Dude, Where's My Car?. The band released four music videos on MuchMusic that received heavy rotation, and released two full-length albums. The band toured consistently, covering Canada and the U.S. East Coast, including a showcase in New York at the notorious CBGB's. In 2003, the band split up and Colette decided to pursue a solo career.
