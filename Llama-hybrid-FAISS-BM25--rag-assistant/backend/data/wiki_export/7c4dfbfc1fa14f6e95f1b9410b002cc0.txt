Joyce Nizzari (born May 20, 1940) is an American model, dancer, and actress. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for its December 1958 issue. Her centerfold was photographed by Bunny Yeager. She was born in The Bronx, New York and is of Italian descent.

Model career
Yeager discovered Nizzari in Miami when she was 15, but only had her do bikini shots until after Joyce turned 18. In August 1957, Nizzari won a cup awarded by the Florida Photographers Association. She was chosen queen of its annual convention.

She dated Hugh Hefner for a few years following her Playmate appearance, and she worked as a Bunny at the first Playboy Club in Chicago. In the late 1990s, Joyce returned to the Playboy fold full-time as one of Hefner's assistants in the Playboy Mansion.

Film actress
Nizzari appears in two films starring Frank Sinatra: A Hole In The Head (1959) and Come Blow Your Horn (1963). In the latter, a Paramount Pictures release, she played a zany interpretive dancer named Snow. When she signed to play in Come Blow Your Horn, Nizzari had completed Chips Off the Old Block, a Barry Ashton dance revue, at the Statler Hilton in Los Angeles. She also played a bit part in the slapstick comedy The Great Race with Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis.

Marriage
Nizzari was married to character actor Jack Hogan.
