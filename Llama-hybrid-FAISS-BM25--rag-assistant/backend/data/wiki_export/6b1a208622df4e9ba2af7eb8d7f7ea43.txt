Cited in the German book Texte zur Theorie des Films (Albersmeier 1998, p.304) [texts about theory of film]: 
"A. Room, declared opponent of the concept of   Sergey Eisenstein, postulated in his essay  Moi kinoubezhdeniya (My beliefs of film) in: Soviet screen, 1926, m. 8, p. 5: Prior importance in film must be the living human... [in german:  Vorrangige Bedeutung kommt im Film dem lebendigen Menschen zu...], exactly that what Eisenstein declined."
