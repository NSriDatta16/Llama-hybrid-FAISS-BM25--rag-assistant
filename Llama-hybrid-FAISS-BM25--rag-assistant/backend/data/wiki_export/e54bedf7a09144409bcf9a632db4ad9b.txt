The World Rally Championship for Manufacturers (or WRC Manufacturers' Championship) is a title awarded by the FIA to the most successful manufacturer over a World Rally Championship season, as determined by a points system based on rally results. The WRC was formed from well-known and popular international rallies, most of which had previously been part of the European Rally Championship and/or the International Championship for Manufacturers; the series was first contested in 1973. The first official rallying Manufacturers' Champion was Alpine-Renault. On seventeen occasions the Manufacturers' Champion team has not contained the World Drivers' Champion for a given season.

In the 45 seasons the Championship has been awarded, only 13 different manufacturers have won it; Lancia being the most successful, with 10 titles including 6 consecutive from 1987 to 1992. Only seven countries have produced winning manufacturers: France (3), Japan (3), Italy (2), the United Kingdom (2), Germany (2), South Korea (1), and United States (1).
