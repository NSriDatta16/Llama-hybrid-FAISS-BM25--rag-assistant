Tellurium hexafluoride is the inorganic compound of tellurium and fluorine with the chemical formula TeF6. It is a colorless, highly toxic gas with an unpleasant odor.

Preparation 
Tellurium hexafluoride can be prepared by treating tellurium with fluorine gas at 150 °C. It can also be prepared by fluorination of TeO3 with bromine trifluoride. Upon heating, TeF4 disproportionates to give TeF6 and Te.

Properties 
Tellurium hexafluoride is a highly symmetric octahedral molecule.  Its physical properties resemble those of the hexafluorides of sulfur and selenium.  It is less volatile, however, due to the increase in polarizability.  At temperatures below −38 °C, tellurium hexafluoride condenses to a volatile white solid.

Reactivity 
Tellurium hexafluoride is much more chemically reactive than SF6. For example, TeF6 slowly hydrolyzes to Te(OH)6:
TeF6 + 6 H2O → Te(OH)6 + 6 HF
Treatment of tellurium hexafluoride with tetramethylammonium fluoride (Me4NF) gives, sequentially, the hepta- and octafluorides:
TeF6 + Me4NF → Me4NTeF7
Me4NTeF7 + Me4NF → (Me4N)2TeF8
