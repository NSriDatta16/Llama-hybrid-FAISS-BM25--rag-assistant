The M1 in, Queensland, Australia, is a major urban road corridor. It connects the Sunshine Coast hinterland to Tugun, near the New South Wales and Queensland border, via the following corridors:
 Bruce Highway between Kybong and Bald Hills
 Gateway Motorway between Bald Hills and Eight Mile Plains
 Pacific Motorway between Eight Mile Plains and Tugun

The Pacific Motorway continues on south from the M1 into New South Wales, while the Bruce Highway continues further north from the M1 up the Queensland coast. Both of these roads and the M1 itself are part of the line of route of National Highway 1, although M1 signage is used for that part of the corridor.

Development
With the completion of Section C of the Bruce Highway - Cooroy to Curra upgrade project (Traveston to Woondum) in February 2018 the M1 has now been extended to Kybong,  south of Gympie. The Bruce Highway from Kybong to Gympie remains signed as A1. Section D of the project (Woondum to Curra, including a bypass of Gympie) will, when completed, become the next stage of the M1.

Note: While the references use Woondum as a designator for sections of the project the new intersection that marks the end of the M1 is wholly within the locality of Kybong, although bordered on two sides by Woondum.

A number of travel/service centres exist on the M1. These include:
