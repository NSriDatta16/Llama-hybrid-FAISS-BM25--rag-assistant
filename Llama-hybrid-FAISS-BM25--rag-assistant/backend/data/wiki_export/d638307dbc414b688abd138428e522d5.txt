On February 23, 2015, Capel made headlines for using the term "jigaboo" in reference to Lady Gaga's performance at the 87th Academy Awards. Lady Gaga performed a tribute to Julie Andrews and The Sound of Music, with a medley of songs from the film.  Of Lady Gaga's performance, Capel remarked, "Lady Gaga surprising a lot of people last night with this tribute to Sound of Music," and added that actress Julie Andrews called it "wonderful."  Capel went on to say "It's hard to really hear her voice with all the jigaboo music — whatever you want to call it — jigaboo." "She has a gorgeous voice. I never knew."  After the nature of the term as a racial slur was noted online, Capel apologized.  She claimed ignorance of the word, later tweeting, "I apologize if I offended you, I had no idea it was a word or what it meant. Thank you for watching."

Fox 8 news director Andy Fishman responded to the controversy saying, "Kristi apologized on the air shortly after making the remark. She did not know what the word meant but that is no excuse for using it,"  Fishman also said, "We have spoken with her and are confident nothing like this will happen again."
