History
Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of  Nautilus machines, Arthur Jones.  Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of developing a fitness machine that accommodates human movement. The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.

Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products. In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired the Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster brands between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.
