Dancing Stage EuroMix is a music video game, developed by Konami, released to European arcades in August 2000. In North America, the game was released as Dance Dance Revolution USA in October 2000. Dancing Stage EuroMix was also released for the PlayStation on June 1, 2001.

Gameplay
The core gameplay involves the player stepping their feet to correspond with the arrows that appear on screen and the beat. During normal gameplay, arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over a set of stationary arrows near the top (referred to as the "guide arrows" or "receptors", officially known as the Step Zone). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrows on the dance platform, and the player is given a judgement for their accuracy of every streaked note.
