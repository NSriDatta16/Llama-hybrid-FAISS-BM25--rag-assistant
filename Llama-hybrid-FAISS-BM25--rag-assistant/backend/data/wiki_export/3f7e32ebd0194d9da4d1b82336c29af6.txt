Biography
He studied in Jihlava and Prague. From 1604 he was active at the University of Prague where he taught classical philology and later mathematics. He was the dean and vice-rector of the university. He was involved in the development of Czech humanism.

He was the author of the first systematic Czech grammar (Grammaticae Bohemicae ad leges naturalis methodi conformatae, et notis numerisque illustratae ac distinctae, libri duo, 1603). He also drew attention to Slovak as a distinct language and urged Slovaks to cultivate their language decades before national linguistic revival.
