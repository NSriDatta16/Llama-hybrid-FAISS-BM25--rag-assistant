Chungjeong of Goryeo (9 January 1338 – 23 March 1352, r. 1348–1351), born Wang Jeo (), was the 30th ruler of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea and was enthroned by imperial edict at the age of 12. He was sometimes known by his Mongolian name, Chosgen Dorji (迷思監朶兒只).

Biography
During King Chungjeong's brief reign, the politics of the court were controlled by powerful relatives of the royal family, including his mother's relative Yun Si-u and the retainer Bae Jeon. In addition, the country endured heavy Wokou raids beginning in 1349.

King Chungjeong's uncle Wang Gi secured imperial favor and married a Yuan daughter, Princess Noguk. Shortly thereafter King Chungjeong was deposed, and Wang Gi ascended the throne as King Gongmin.
