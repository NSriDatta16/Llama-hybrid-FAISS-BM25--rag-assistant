A fast runner with excellent defensive skills, Clines debuted in 1970 with the Pirates as a reserve outfielder, hitting .405 (15-for-37) in 31 games in his rookie year. On September 1, 1971, Clines played in MLB's first-ever all-minority batting lineup.

Clines went to the postseason with Pittsburgh in the 1971, 1972, and 1974 National League Championship Series, winning a World Series ring with the Pirates in . His most productive season came in 1972, when he posted career-highs in average (.334), doubles (15), and triples (6) in 107 games.

After the 1974 season, the Pirates traded Clines to the New York Mets for Duffy Dyer. After the 1975 season, the Mets traded him to the Texas Rangers for Joe Lovitto. Before the 1977 season, the Rangers sent Clines to the Chicago Cubs as the player to be named later in the earlier trade for Darold Knowles. The Cubs released Clines in May 1979. He batted .277 in 10 MLB seasons.

Coaching career
Clines remained with the Cubs as a coach. He stayed on Chicago's coaching staff until 1981, and then joined the Houston Astros organization as a roving minor league hitting instructor, a position he held through 1987. Later, he worked as a hitting coach for Houston in 1988. The Seattle Mariners hired Clines as their hitting coach before the 1988 season. He spent six seasons as a hitting coach for the Mariners, and was fired after the 1992 season. He was the hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1993 and 1994 before joining the San Francisco Giants as a minor league hitting coordinator. After the 1996 season, the Giants promoted him to be their major league hitting coach.

After the 2002 season, Giants' manager Dusty Baker was hired to manage the Cubs. Baker brought Clines to Chicago with him as his first base coach. He was named hitting coach prior to the 2005 season. Baker was fired after the 2006 season, and his coaching staff was dismissed with him.

The Los Angeles Dodgers hired Clines as their roving outfield and base-running instructor in October 2006; he convinced Juan Pierre to sign with the Dodgers the next month. After the 2011 season, he was promoted to the position of senior advisor for player development with the Dodgers.
