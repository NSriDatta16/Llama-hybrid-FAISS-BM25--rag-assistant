Haunted House in Sur AlShiyadi 
A picture of an abandoned house has surfaced the media recently with a caption of (The house that Jinn protect) where some people claim or speculate that the house cannot be bulldozed as all machines just don't work when they go to its vicinity. We all love a good ghost story but in reality, the owner (or the inheritor) of the house is refusing for house to be destroyed, in fact he threatened to sue for over 3 million Omani Rials if they did so. That is pretty much the real story.
