Playing career
Demyanenko began his football career as a student of the Dnipro-75 football school in his home city of Dnipropetrovsk. He was added to the squad of the local Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk of the Soviet Top League in the 1975 season. However, he debuted for the main team of Dnipro in the 1978 season. By the end of that season he had played 20 games and scored 1 goal.

In 1979 Romensky played couple of games for Ukraine at the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR.

Demyanenko was a longtime Dynamo Kyiv captain and a prolific left-footed player for the Soviet Union who could patrol the entire flank from defence to offence. In December 2000 he was voted the 3rd best player in the Ukrainian 'Team of the Century' according to a poll by The Ukrainsky Futbol weekly, behind Andrei Shevchenko and Oleg Blokhin. Demyanenko is fourth in the all time caps records for the USSR and played in three World Cups for them.
