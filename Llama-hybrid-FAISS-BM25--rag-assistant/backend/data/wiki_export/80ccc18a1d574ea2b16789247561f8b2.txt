Hyde  was a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1885 until 1918. It was seated in the town of Hyde, Cheshire.

From the 1918 general election onwards, the town has been represented in parliament through the constituency of Stalybridge and Hyde.

Boundaries 
The constituency, officially Cheshire, Hyde Division, was created from the two-member Eastern division of Cheshire by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 as one of eight new single-member divisions of Cheshire. It consisted of the following parishes and townships in north east Cheshire:
Bredbury, the part of Brinnington outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport, Godley
, Hattersley, Hollingworth, Hyde, Marple, Mottram, Newton, Offerton, Romiley, Tintwistle, Torkington and Werneth.

Abolition
The Representation of the People Act 1918 reorganised constituencies throughout Great Britain. The bulk of the Hyde constituency was merged with parliamentary borough of Stalybridge to form the new seat of Stalybridge and Hyde. The Bredbury, Marple and Romiley areas passed to an expanded Macclesfield constituency, while Offerton and Torkington, which now formed part of the urban district of Hazel Grove and Bramhall, were included in Knutsford.
