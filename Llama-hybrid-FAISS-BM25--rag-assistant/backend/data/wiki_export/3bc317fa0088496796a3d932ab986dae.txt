It was known as the Stade Roger Lapergue for two years, its architecture made it one of the most beautiful stadiums of its time. It was initially built with two side stands and a Party hall. its name will then become the name of the city as Stade communal de Saint Eugène. Later the stadium becomes available to MC Alger, becoming the main stadium in the League Algiers. In 1957, the third platform will be built, consisting of two superimposed stands on the south side, arched and connecting the two original stands, this new platform will give a modern look at the municipal stadium. After the independence of Algeria in 1962, the city of St. Eugene will be called Bologhine new name for the town. The upper gallery of the stadium was severely damaged at the piers during the 1980 El Asnam earthquake (currently Chlef).
