The park is situated very close to the National Highway 47. Currently, Infopark, Thrissur possesses 30 acres of prime land. It is expected that some more land also will be added to the Park in the near future. Infrastructure development work for the Park has already commenced. The first set of IT Buildings of approximately 40,000 sft area with plug and play facilities is ready and companies have started setting-up operations at Thrissur. Phase-II additional 3,30 lakhs sft of space will be ready for allotment by October 2015.

Transportation

There are a small number of private buses which operate into the InfoPark campus from different corners of Kochi city such as Aluva, downtown Ernakulam and Thripunithura. Mostly private bus will not come on time and working people need to commute via Auto rickshaws or Taxis. KMRL operates AC low-floor feeder bus services to and from InfoPark of 2 trips a day.

A boat service runs between Vyttila Mobility Hub and Kakkanad jetty, which is located close to the InfoPark Expressway. This ferry covers the distance between Vyttila and Kakkanad in 20 minutes.

The Kochi Metro rail has planned its extension to Kakkanad from Kaloor Stadium. This extension will terminate at InfoPark with a metro station each at Phase-I and Phase-II campuses, thus giving efficient metro rail connectivity to the IT park.

The lack of transport connectivity to Infopark at Kakkanad is a big hurdle for the 30,000 workforces. At a workshop on ‘Connecting the Dots on Public Transport’, recently organized by CPPR and WTC, Kochi has come up with a slew of proposals to develop public transport in the area. These, include re-routing of buses or providing additional bus services to the area, introducing modern transportation infrastructure such as demand-based bus systems and improving existing water and road connectivity to the area.
