The Ford F-250 Super Chief was a concept heavy-duty truck built by Ford. It featured a tri-flex fueling system that allows users to use three different fuels including gasoline, E85 ethanol or hydrogen. This is intended to make the Super Chief more attractive to customers who are concerned about finding fuel as the ethanol and hydrogen infrastructures are developing. In a tri-flex fueling system owners can utilize any given option at any one time. It comes with a stock bed cover and liner; it is a crew cab. In addition, the rear doors have been converted to suicide doors.

The tri-flex fueling system on the Ford F-250 Super Chief allows operators to go 500 miles between total refueling with the supercharger activated only when using the hydrogen fueling system. The hydrogen system also provides 400Â lb.-ft. of torque. The transfer between fueling options is performed through a switching system onboard and can be accomplished while the vehicle is running. The hydrogen-based fuel alternative boasts 12-percent greater fuel efficiency when compared to either of the remaining fueling options. Using hydrogen also provides 99-percent less  emissions than the gasoline-only option.

While the tri-flex system is a new concept at Ford, the automaker has been committed to providing customers with a flex-fueling system in their Ford F-150 models for 2005 and 2006 that allows either unleaded or E85 to be used in the same tank. The tri-flex system is a bold proclamation by Ford that hydrogen may be the next readily available fuel supply for the world, and they are ready to roll with the roll out.

Design
In design, the Super Chief has a very similar style and appearance to the 2002 Mighty F-350 Concept. Hence its nameplate, the front end and grille was inspired by the locomotives of the same name. The grille bars also foreshadows the very future 2018 Super Duty Limited trim, along with the headlights foreshadowing the 2021-2023 Ford F-150.

Powertrain 
Not much is known about the powertrain, other than the engine being a supercharged tri-flex 6.8 L V10 producing 550 horsepower.

Appearances

Despite that it never went into production, the Super Chief appeared in a off-road driving game for the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 2 called Ford Racing: Off Road. Being the most powerful and also most expensive vehicle in the game, it included both Ford and Land Rover vehicles.

It also appeared as a body, on the opening of formerly Myrtle Beach, South Carolina-based Ridemakerz' toy car building shop. The body is still available, as it's still produced under license to Ridemakerz.

According to IGCD (the Internet Game Cars Database), it (now) appears in the 2017 mobile game Top Drives.
