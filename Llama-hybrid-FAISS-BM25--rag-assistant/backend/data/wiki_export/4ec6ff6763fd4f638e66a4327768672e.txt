Preston Lodge Former Pupil Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Prestonpans in East Lothian, Scotland. Formed in 1929, they currently play in Scottish National League Division Two.

History

The club formed in 1929–30 with Dr. Boyle as its first president and originates from the roots of Preston Lodge High School, formed in 1924. This connection is still going strong today. The club fields teams at every age group Primary 1–7, Secondary 1–3, under-16, under-18. As well as fielding two senior XV's. The Club has formed links over the years with United Pirates – a club in New Zealand and Balmy Beach rugby club in Toronto, Canada. This has allowed for the exchange of players and coaching techniques.

A number of PLRFC players have played age group rugby for Scotland and gaining many caps for their country. The most recent and successful players to do this are Scott Murray and Allan Jacobsen, both played for Edinburgh and Scotland.
