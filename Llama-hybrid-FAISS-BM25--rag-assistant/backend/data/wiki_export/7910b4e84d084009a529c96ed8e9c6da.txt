Accidents & Incidents
On April 1, 2000, an Aerotek PITTS S-2A crashed while attempting to land on 2H0's runway 14. The aircraft impacted a golf cart applying weed killer near the airport. The gold cart driver received fatal injuries. The probable cause of the crash was the pilot's improper touchdown point and runway alignment, with contributing factors including insufficient gold cart markings and the fact that the golf cart was not equipped with a radio. Additional factors include the fact that airport personnel neglected to issue NOTAMs to notify pilots that maintenance was ongoing.
On April 21, 2010, an experimental Murray Starlite aircraft was substantially damaged while landing at the Shelbyville Airport. The left main tire “locked up” and the airplane veered to the left. The pilot applied full right rudder and aileron, but the airplane continued to veer off the left side of the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage when it entered a plowed field, which caused the main landing gear to collapse and the left main tire to go through the left wing. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the corrosion of the left landing gear rotor and brake, which resulted in the loss of directional control during the landing rollout, and the pilot's inadequate preflight inspection.
