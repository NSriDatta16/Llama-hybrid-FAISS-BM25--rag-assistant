Historic schools 

Henry Sabin Elementary School in Iowa City, Iowa was located at 509 South Dubuque Street.  The building housed an alternative high school, but was originally known as the First Ward School.  The school was named for the Iowa educator Henry Sabin. The school closed as an elementary school circa 1979.  It was known throughout the 1970s for its alternative teaching methods, including open classrooms and discussions about drug abuse and sexuality.  Above the kindergarten level, classes were pairedâ€”first and second grade, third and fourth grade, and fifth and sixth grade. Ana Mendieta, an art teacher at the school for a few years in the mid-1970s, would achieve some renown as an artist. The building was torn down in 2015.
