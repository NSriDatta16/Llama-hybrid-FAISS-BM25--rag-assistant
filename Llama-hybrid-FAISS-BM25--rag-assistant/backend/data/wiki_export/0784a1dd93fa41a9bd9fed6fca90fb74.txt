The Gir or Gyr is an Indian breed of zebuine cattle originating in the state of Gujarat. Other names include Bhodah, Desan, Gujarati, Kathiawari, Sorthi and Surti.

These cattle were exported to Brazil from the early twentieth century, and the Brazilian Gir numbers about five million head; selective breeding since the 1960s has led to the development of separate dairy (Gir Leiteiro) and beef strains.

History 

It has been used locally in the improvement of other breeds including the Red Sindhi and the Sahiwal. It was also one of the breeds used in the development of the Brahman breed in North America.  In Brazil and other South American countries the Gir is used frequently because, as a Bos indicus breed, it is resistant to hot temperatures and tropical diseases.  It is well known for its milk producing qualities and is often bred with Friesian cows to make the Girolando breed.

Characteristics 

The Gir is distinctive in appearance, typically having a rounded and domed forehead (being the only ultraconvex breed in the world), long pendulous ears and horns which spiral out and back. Gir are generally mottled with the colour ranging from red through yellow to white, black being the only unacceptable colour. They originated in west India in the state of Gujarat and have since spread to neighbouring Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

Cows average  in weight and  in height; bulls weigh  on average, with a height of . At birth, calves weigh about .
