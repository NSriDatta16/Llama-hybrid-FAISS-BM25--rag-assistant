Proposed merger with Newcastle 
A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended the merger of a number of adjoining councils. In the initial proposal, Port Stephens Council was not included in any amalgamation proposals. However, after Lake Macquarie City Council successfully avoided a proposed merger between it and Newcastle City Council, the Minister for Local Government subsequently proposed that Newcastle City Council instead merge with Port Stephens Council to form a new council with an area of  and support a population of approximately 230,000.

The proposed merger was met with significant opposition. Thousands of residents attended rallies and signed petitions opposed to the proposal, while 470 attended public inquiry meetings. The state member for Port Stephens, Kate Washington, former state member Craig Baumann and broadcaster Alan Jones all publicly expressed their opposition. Federal Liberal member for Paterson, Bob Baldwin, spoke in parliament, urging the Liberal Baird government to reconsider the proposal, claiming "this proposal seems to defy logic". Port Stephens Council claimed that 93% of residents surveyed were opposed to the merger and included the results of its community survey in its submission to the delegate responsible for evaluating the merger. In response to the government's proposal, Port Stephens Council formally asked the government to evaluate a merger between Port Stephens and Dungog Shire. Although the mayor of Dungog Shire opposed the merger, it was reported that the proposal had community support within both local government areas. The proposal was debated in the New South Wales parliament on 23 March 2016, with the Minister for Local Government confirming that the proposal had been referred to the Office of Local Government.

On 14 February 2017, the NSW government announced it would not be proceeding with further regional council mergers, including the Newcastle City Council and Port Stephens Council merger.

Climate action 
In 2020, Port Stephens Council adopted a climate change policy and joined the Cities Power Partnership. The policy recognised that climate in Australia is continuing to change and ongoing action is needed to ensure a sustainable future.

Council’s climate action plan has three main focus areas: Education; Mitigation; and Adaptation. Council committed to responding to the challenges of climate change in the following ways:

 Consulting widely with local residents and businesses to raise awareness of climate change risks and strategies for effective climate change management, mitigation, and adaptation. 
 Seeking feedback and ideas from the community on how to better manage, mitigate and build community resilience to climate change risks.
 Preparing and implementing a sustainability strategy and action plan to clearly communicate its sustainability actions, targets and performance indicators.
 Reducing contributions to climate change by implementing a range of sustainability projects.
 Reviewing and maintaining a Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan.
 Regularly publishing its progress and achievements in managing climate change risks in alignment with the Integrated Planning and Reporting framework.
 Investigating and sourcing funding opportunities to support Council’s climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.

In 2021, Council passed a motion that committed to achieving carbon neutrality for its operations by 2025. GHG emission reduction achievements to date include installing in several council buildings: solar voltaic systems; LED lighting and; programmable logic controllers to deliver energy efficiencies and reduce costs. In a first for the region, recycled glass 'greencrete' was used in the upgrade of the Tanilba Bay roundabout.

Council has recently commenced a baseline study of its current GHG emissions, and is expected to commence work on a ‘roadmap’ for carbon neutrality, a renewable energy target later in 2022. However, Council has not adopted a climate emergency declaration and does not have a detailed Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan which encompasses community-wide emissions, as committed in its overall 2020 climate change policy.

Founded in 2019, Climate Action Port Stephens (CAPS) is a not-for-profit community group of Port Stephens residents who are concerned about global climate change and ecological crises and want real climate action in the community. CAPS petitioned Council in 2019 and in 2020 to declare a climate emergency. CAPS is one of over 30 community groups, businesses and individuals who have joined EcoNetwork Port Stephens which was founded in 1993 as a not-for-profit, apolitical and 100% volunteer-run organisation acting as a significant voice for nature conservation and the environment.
