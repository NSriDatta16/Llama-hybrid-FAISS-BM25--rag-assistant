Mechanix is the tenth studio album by English hard rock band UFO, released in February 1982 by Chrysalis Records.

Music press adverts carried the tagline, 'Mechanix: it will tighten your nuts.'

Immediately after the accompanying tour, founding member Way left to join former Motörhead guitarist "Fast" Eddie Clarke in Fastway.

Mechanix was reissued in 1994 on Repertoire Records. It was also reissued in 2009, remastered and with an expanded booklet and bonus tracks.
