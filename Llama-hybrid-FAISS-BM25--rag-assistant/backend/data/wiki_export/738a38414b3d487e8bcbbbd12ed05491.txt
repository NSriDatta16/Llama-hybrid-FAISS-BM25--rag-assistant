Views

Congress 
According to Naqvi, a "baseless" campaign had been started by Congress party to prevent Indian Muslims from joining the Bharatiya Janata Party. Naqvi has also said that he does not harbour the allegations of Congress that as BJP came to power, there was nobody to cause riots against the minority community.

Muslims 
Naqvi feels that Muslims don't desert other Muslims if they are given important posts in the Bharatiya Janata Party. For the party to increase support amongst the Muslims; he opines that they should feel that they are "equal citizens of this country",  and also "understand that the bill on Muslim Personal Law will not take away their right to practise their religion". In addition, the party should also make them aware of the works done by the Vajpayee government.

Naqvi has also said that there is "no justification" for the 2002 Gujarat riots. In November 2015, when actor Aamir Khan said that he felt of leaving the country, Naqvi defended by saying that he had made the comment "in a hurry or maybe under influence from others".

BJP and RSS 
Naqvi has said that Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are two "separate entities" and each of them has different views on different issues. According to him RSS is a nationalist organization and not an "anti-national" one.

Books 
Naqvi has written three books - Syah (1991), Danga (1998) and Vaisali (2008).
