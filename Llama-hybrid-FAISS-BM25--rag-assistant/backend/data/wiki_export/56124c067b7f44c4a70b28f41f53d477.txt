Lgov () is a town in Kursk Oblast, Russia, located on both banks of the Seym River (Desna's tributary)  west of Kursk. Population:    26,000 (1972).

History
It was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1152 under the name of Olgov (a possessive adjective from an old Russian name Olg, or Oleg). Lgov was razed to the ground by the Mongols. In 1669, Lgov Monastery was founded on the spot of the former town, which would be closed down in 1764. The monastic sloboda was transformed into the town of Lgov in 1779. During World War II, Lgov was occupied by German troops from 27 October 1941 to 3 March 1943.

On September 18, 2022, the town was heavily damaged by a significant F2/T5 tornado. Over 200 structures were damaged or destroyed as a result of this strong wedge tornado. Many residential structures had roofs torn off, and some sustained collapse of their exterior walls, but most of these structures were poorly-built homes. Numerous trees were downed, and high-voltage power lines were also damaged or destroyed.
