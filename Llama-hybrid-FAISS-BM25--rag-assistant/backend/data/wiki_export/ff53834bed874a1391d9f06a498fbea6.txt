Mrs. Prosser (pseud.) or Sophie Amelia Prosser, born Sophia Amelia Dibdin (17 May 1807 – 14 February 1882) was a British author. She was known for her sentimental morality tales and fables.

Personal
Prosser was born in London, the daughter of Charles Dibdin the Younger and his wife Mary Bates.  She was the granddaughter of the extremely prolific songwriter Charles Dibdin, and may have inherited her productive bent from him.

On 1 January 1830 she married William Prosser, a surgeon and later a clergyman.

Prosser is buried in Bilston, Staffordshire, England.

Career
Most of Prosser's books were apparently first published by the Religious Tract Society of London, England, and reprinted by that group for many years thereafter (some of the volumes are imprinted as having been published by the Leisure Hour Office, which may also have been an imprint of the Religious Tract Society).

All of her books were imprinted "By Mrs. Prosser" without any more details given.

Style
The books are generally exceedingly slim novellas or collections of short stories. They are not considered of the highest literary standard, and their stilted, moralizing tone is of a sort that the author Lewis Carroll lampooned.
