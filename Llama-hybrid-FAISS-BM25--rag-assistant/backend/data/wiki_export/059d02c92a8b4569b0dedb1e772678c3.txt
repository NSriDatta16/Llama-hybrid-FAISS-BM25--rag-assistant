Controversies
The company that owned the newspaper S.C. Meta Ring S.R.L. has sued the journalist and the blogger, Simona Tache, for the author copyrights infringement, when she published an article where she has joshed the habit related to publishing of a calendar with the  company's female employees in feminine and even erotic states, presenting the pictures taken from those calendars. The journalist claims of having the right  to use, without the author's consent, the passages of the work to exemplify the opinion she expresses freely. The company demanded to remove the  photos used as an example and to pay the damages amounting to 50 Lei per day, but the first instance rejected the applicant's claim. In September 2016 the process was in the appeal phase.
