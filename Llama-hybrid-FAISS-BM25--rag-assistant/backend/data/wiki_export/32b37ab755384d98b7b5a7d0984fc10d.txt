Alan Seth Chartock (born July 25, 1941) was the president and chief executive officer of WAMC/Northeast Public Radio, a National Public Radio affiliate, from 1981 to 2023.  He was professor of political science at SUNY New Paltz and is a professor emeritus of communications at the State University of New York (SUNY), and is executive publisher and project director for the Legislative Gazette, a weekly newspaper staffed by college intern reporters covering New York State government.

Chartock served in a variety of on-air roles at WAMC, including but not limited to hosting the Capitol Connection, Vox Pop, and Conversations with programs, sitting on panels for The Roundtable and The Media Project, serving as a political commentator, and filling a central role in the thrice-annual fund drives.  He also writes a syndicated column on politics which appears in newspapers throughout New York state.

Views of WAMC news and political commentary

Chartock's political views
Chartock says he is concerned about governmental restrictions on free speech. He is dismayed by what he calls the proliferation of corporate-run radio stations, which he believes express extreme right-wing views without giving opposing viewpoints.  He has called Pete Seeger "an American hero".

According to Gadi Dechter of CityPaper.com, Chartock "publishes a blog on WAMC's web site that has featured sharp attacks on the Republican party, the Bush administration, and 'neocons' in general."

Support for Chartock's programming
Stephen Yasko, manager of WTMD (89.7 FM), an NPR member station in Towson, Maryland which plays mostly adult-alternative music, contends that any quality-control challenges which might be created by NPR's decentralized nature are outweighed by the advantage of unique local programming.

"Public radio stations reflect the values and texture of the communities they serve," says Yasko, who has also worked in the NPR member services department. "If NPR or any national organization had too much control or input into every station's local personality, then you would lose the very thing that makes us what we are. So if Alan Chartock is what Albany and upstate New York created and what works for them, that's a beautiful thing, no matter what some outsiders might say."

Under Chartock's leadership, WAMC grew into a network of 14 stations (all broadcasting identical programming) and a web-based platform serving portions of seven New England and Middle Atlantic states, bringing news, information and cultural programming to what station leaders claim is an audience of nearly 400,000 monthly listeners. The station's thrice-yearly fund drives have a goal of $1 million each as of 2013.

Departure from WAMC 
In May 2023, the station abruptly announced that Chartock was retiring effective immediately. His departure was announced after the then-81-year-old had taken time off earlier in the week to consider ending his career and after his on-air time had been reduced, station officials told the Albany Times Union. Chartock's resignation came just months after convincing the station's board of trustees to boost his base salary by more than $100,000â€”a move that brought his base compensation to roughly $350,000 a year.
