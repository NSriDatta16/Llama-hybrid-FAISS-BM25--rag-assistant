Live is a live album by hardcore punk and reggae pioneers Bad Brains. It was recorded during a 1987 tour. "Day Tripper", a Beatles cover, appears on some editions. After the tour finished, the band commenced a series of departures, breakups, and reunions.

Production
The album was produced by Phil Burnett. Two subsequent live albums were drawn from the same 1987 tour.

Critical reception
AllMusic wrote: "Live is such a stunner because the basic inimitable qualities are still here: the unbelievable overload attack, the crashing power riffs, the stop-start precision marveled at by every casual listener who ever came across them, the explosive surges, the awesome musicians, the breathtaking exhilaration rush, and most of all, the irreplaceable singer H.R." Trouser Press called the album "impressive," writing that the band play "punk, thrashy rock and reggae with equal command and conviction (Earl Hudson’s deft drumming is crucial to the band’s gear-shifting ability)." The New Rolling Stone Album Guide deemed the album inferior to The Youth Are Getting Restless.
