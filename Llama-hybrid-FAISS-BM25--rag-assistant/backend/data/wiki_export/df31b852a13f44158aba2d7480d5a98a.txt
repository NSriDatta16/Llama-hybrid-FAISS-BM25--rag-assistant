The Methodist Ladies' College, Perth (MLC Perth), is an independent, Uniting Church, day and boarding school for girls, located in Claremont, a western suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

Founded by the Methodist Church of Australia in 1907, MLC is a non-selective school, and currently caters for more than 1,170 girls from pre-kindergarten to Year 12, including 90 boarders.

The college was ranked as the number one TEE school in the state for 2006 and 2008 seeing 55.1 percent of students achieving a mark of seventy five percent or above in at least one subject.

History
The foundation stone of the Methodist Ladies' College was laid, and building began in 1907, by the Methodist Church of Australia. Classes were first commenced in February 1908 with 31-day girls and 23 boarders.

The early traditions of the college were established by Maud Connell, Head Mistress from 1908 to 1913, who chose the colours of green and gold, and the school motto Per Ardua Ad Alta, which may be translated from Latin as "Strive for the Highest". In 1917, MLC's first university students graduated from the University of Western Australia, which had begun teaching in 1913.

MLC became a school of the Uniting Church in Australia in the 1970s, as the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches came together to form the Uniting Church.

House system
As with most Australian schools, MLC utilises a house system through which girls participate in inter-house activities.  When the house system first came into effect in June 1927, there were four houses: Athens, Rome, Sparta and Troy.  In 1967, two more houses were added, Corinth and Olympia.  Each house is named after a famous ancient city.
 Athens – green
 Corinth – purple
 Olympia – white
 Rome – red
 Sparta – yellow
 Troy – blue

Annual house events include:
 House Singing, Mime and Drama Day (HSMD), in which every girl from years 7 through to year 12 compete in at least one activity for their house.
 A choir performance conducted by two Year 12 students. Each house performs one song chosen by the conductresses. Part of HSMD.
 A mime performance for students in Years 7, 8 and 9, directed by two Year 11 students. Part of HSMD.
 A drama performance for Years 10, 11 and 12 students, directed by two students from Year 12. Part of HSMD.
 Interhouse Sports – Throughout the year the students participate in many sporting activities for their house, such as swimming in term 1, and athletics in term 2.

A new initiative in 2010 is The Spirit Cape. In all house events, houses will also compete for the Spirit Cape with it being awarded to the house that shows the most spirit over the course of the day. At the end of the year, one house will be awarded the Spirit Cape for the showing the most year-long house spirit. In 2010, Athens won the inaugural year-long Spirit Cape.

Annual events
MLC holds a large number of events annually for sports and the arts, including:
 The Heather Lamont Festival, named after Heather Lamont, a boarder from 1958–1959, who was killed in an accident on her parents' farm during the Christmas holidays. It became a house competition featuring activities such as singing, dancing, music, Languages; French, German and Japanese, cooking, photography, visual art, debating, public speaking and drama.
 College Sunday, a church service held in late March for all students and their families. Attendants wear white and there are performances from different groups in the college.
