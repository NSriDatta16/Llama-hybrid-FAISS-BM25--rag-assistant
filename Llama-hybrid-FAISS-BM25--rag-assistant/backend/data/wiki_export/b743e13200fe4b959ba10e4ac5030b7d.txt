History
The University of Maine at Augusta was established in 1965 by an act of the 102nd Maine Legislature as a continuing education division of the University of Maine.  In September, 1967, it was approved as a campus of the University of Maine and began offering day and evening classes. In 1971, it became a separate campus in the University of Maine system. In 1995, the University of Maine System Board of Trustees added University College of Bangor (UCB) to UMA.
The university now has nine locations besides the Augusta campus, in Bangor, Brunswick, East Millinocket, Ellsworth, Houlton, Lewiston, Rockland, Rumford and Saco.
