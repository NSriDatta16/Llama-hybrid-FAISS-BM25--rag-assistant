Verma, and was brought to his lab. The monster Bufalo attacked them there and Prof. K.K. Verma revealed to Vinay that he had made a costume that could give him superpowers.

Powers and Abilities
Parmanu's costume gives him various superpowers. He can fly up to speed of sound with ease and can go beyond it.Â He can fire atomic bolts from his chest. His wrist gadgets can fire atomic bolts as well and reel out atomic rope. His belt contains many gadgets which help him to teleport, atomize, and reduce his size to any desired level. Initially, he used the button on his belt to do these actions, but later on Probot changed it into a voice recognition device, so that he could use his powers just by calling its name.

Parmanu receives back up from Probot, a robot who keeps an eye on Delhi with the help of his cameras, which he has fitted in numerous locations around the city. And he also gets help from Pralayanka (Mamta Pathak) who also is a creation of his maternal uncle like him.
