The sovereign's role in parliament is ceremonial, with neither the sovereign nor their viceroy (the governor general), participating in the legislative process. However, Royal Assent is still necessary for a bill to become law.

Six members are appointed based on the advice of the prime minister, whilst three members are appointed based on the advice of the leader of the opposition. The other two members are appointed by the governor general based on his or her own judgement. To be appointed as a senator, one must be at least 21 years old.
