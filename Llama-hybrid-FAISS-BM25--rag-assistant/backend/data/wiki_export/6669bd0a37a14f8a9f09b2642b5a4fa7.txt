Parliamentary mentions

Geoff Dodds
In a debate in the Parliament of Australia, on 9 October 2006, Danna Vale MP praised several high school principals including Geoff Dodds of Heathcote High saying "I was privileged to be invited to a year 12 graduation assembly and, once again, was stirred by the thoughtful words of the principal’s Geoff Dodds final address to the students."

Bravery award
A certificate of commendation for bravery was awarded by the New South Wales Parliament to teacher Greg Moon, with the commendation stating as follows:
"Mr Moon was leading an expedition of 10 students along the Dufars river when assistant instructor Gemima Robey slipped and fell into the water at a dangerous bend. With no thought for his own safety, Mr Moon rescued Ms Robey from the river and immediately attempted to resuscitate her. Throughout this, Greg continued to manage the students who were under his care and becoming increasingly distressed."
