The Mercedes-Benz C216 is the last generation for the grand tourer with name Mercedes-Benz CL-Class. It replaced the C215 platform. In 2014 it was replaced by the C217 S-Class Coupe.

Initial release (2006–)

Like its predecessors, the C216 has no B-pillar interrupting the sleek curve of the side windows. The C216 body was designed by Gorden Wagener and Peter Pfeiffer.

The chassis is based on the W221 S-Class. The two-door coupé weighs , heavier than the equivalent S saloon, and rides on a full-size 116.3-inch wheelbase (albeit 8.2 inches less than the long wheelbase S-Class, which is the only S-Class sold in the U.S.). Despite its large size, rear seat legroom is limited in keeping in the tradition of 2+2 luxury coupés, though CL has more rear passenger space than its rivals. The CL's boot is as large as that of the Audi A8 flagship saloon.

The vehicle was unveiled in the 2006 Paris Motor Show, followed by the 28th Bangkok International Motor Show (in right-handed drive configuration).

New features

The Pre-Safe Brake world premiere on the CL-Class C216  with the first partial autonomous braking (40%, or up to 0.4g deceleration) if the driver does not react to the BAS Plus warnings and the system detects a severe danger of an accident. If the driver then immediately applied the brakes, the maximum braking force was available and – depending on the situation – the accident could be averted at the last moment. If an accident was unavoidable, the PRE-SAFE brakes reduced the impact severity and, in turn, the risk of injury to the vehicle occupants.

The Distronic Plus adaptive cruise control is able to bring the car to a complete stop, and accelerate again to the pre-set speed, to keep a pre-set distance away from the car ahead of it. Also introduced active infrared Night View Assist enables drivers to view the conditions in front of the car despite the dark surroundings. Intelligent Light System headlights with five light modes, including active light function.

In 2007 it added the first Mercedes-Benz Blind Spot Assist system (includes six short-range radar sensors in the front and rear bumpers). This was available as option for CL-Class.

AMG Sports package for 2009 CL-Class (including a front apron with large air intakes, rear apron with a black insert and integrated rectangular tailpipe trim in polished stainless steel, AMG side sill panels, 19-inch AMG light-alloy wheels in with a five-spoke design and wide-base 255/40 (front) and 275/40 (rear) tyres (optional 20-inch AMG light-alloy wheels in a twin-spoke design with 255/35 and 275/35 tyres), perforated brake discs and silver-painted brake callipers with Mercedes-Benz lettering (V8/V12 engine models), wood trim and wood/leather steering wheel in black ash, velour floor mats with AMG lettering, sports pedals in brushed stainless steel with rubber studs) was available for CL 500 and CL 500 4MATIC beginning in June 2009.

From 2009, Mercedes-Benz has only been offering the CL 550 in 4Matic in US/Canada, as a strategy to increase sales in snowy regions. While all the systems are the same, the suspension has been degraded from ABC to Airmatic, as 4Matic is not compatible with ABC. The CL 600 and CL 65 AMG remained the same rear-wheel drive variants.

Marketing
As part of Mercedes-Benz CL-Class launch, Mercedes-Benz Accessories GMBH released accessories for the CL-Class vehicles, including leather wallet and business card case in black nappa based on the trim in the CL's cockpit, ash timber pens and umbrella handle based on the wood trim found in the car's cockpit, driving gloves and instrumentation-inspired wristwatch, keyring and money clip with the MB logo, and a diecast model car made by AUTOart.
