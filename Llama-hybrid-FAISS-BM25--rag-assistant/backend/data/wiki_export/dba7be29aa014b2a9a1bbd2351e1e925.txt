On 1 December 2007 Campana joined Isthmian League side Wealdstone on a month's loan. This was in order for him to play competitive football in a gap in reserve team fixtures. Campana made a total of 8 league and cup appearances for Wealdstone scoring 4 goals.

Campana joined Grays Athletic at the start of the 2008–09 season, making his debut on 9 August 2008 in the 3–1 away defeat to Weymouth, coming on as a substitute.
