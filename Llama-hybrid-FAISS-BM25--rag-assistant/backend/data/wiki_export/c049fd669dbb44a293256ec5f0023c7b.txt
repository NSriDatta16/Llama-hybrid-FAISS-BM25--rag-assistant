Playing career 
Born in Irvine, Scotland, Dodds grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He attended Robert Morris University, playing for the Colonials before joining Kilmarnock.

After a seven-year tenure in Scotland he returned to his hometown of Hamilton, and signed with Hamilton Croatia of the Canadian Soccer League. Where he was united with his younger brother Jamie Dodds. He made his debut for the club on 11 June 2010 in a match against Brantford Galaxy.
