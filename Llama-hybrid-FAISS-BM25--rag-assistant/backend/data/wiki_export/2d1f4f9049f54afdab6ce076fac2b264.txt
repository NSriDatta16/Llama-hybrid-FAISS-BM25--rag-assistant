Singles
"Manchester" was released on 8 May 2006 in the UK. It reached 41 in the singles chart, a very disappointing position compared to other first singles. This is thought to be due to the decline of CD singles which, by 2006, were increasingly the preserve of an older audience.

"The Rose of My Cologne" was released on 10 July 2006 in the UK. It reached 99 in the singles chart for the first week. This made this single the worst performing out of all of those released by the band.

As was their usual modus operandi, The Beautiful South included unreleased material on the B-sides of the singles taken from their albums.
