Outdoor Elvis is the second album by rock band The Swirling Eddies, released in 1989 on Alarma Records.

The title track found the Swirling Eddies in search of the elusive Elvis Presley who, according to the song, escaped the city by faking his own death and decided to make his home in the wilderness. The song makes parallels between the search for Elvis, the search for Bigfoot and mankind's search for a king or "savior."

This project gave the Swirling Eddies their first hit songs - "Driving In England" which made it all the way to #1 in some markets, and "Hide the Beer, the Pastor's Here" which also created a small amount of controversy for the album. The latter song tells the tale of a Christian College professor that hides his own hidden sins and attacks his students for their obvious drinking habits. At the end of the song, "Spot" shouts out the name of Christian Colleges around the United States. Some of these colleges were upset that they were mentioned in the song while others were upset that they weren't included.

One song on the album, "Mystery Babylon," had earlier been premiered on the Swirling Eddies Apology Video, which had been sent out to fans that ordered the Spittle & Phlegm video collection.

Outdoor Elvis marks the first appearance of new Swirling Eddies member Prickly Disco. It is also the first appearance of the guest Eddie known as Miracle Babe, whom contributes background vocals on the album.
