Our Sons is a 1991 American made-for-television drama film starring Julie Andrews and Ann-Margret as two mothers of gay sons, one of whom is dying of AIDS. It was inspired by Micki Dickoff's 1987 documentary, Too Little, Too Late, about three families who had supported children with AIDS which had won an Emmy Award.

As it was a TV movie, ”It’s much safer to take the route of dealing with the two mothers” as the protagonists, said director John Erman.

It was broadcast the same day as GMHC's annual AIDS Walk in New York.

Plot
With his partner Donald dying of AIDS, James asks his mother Audrey, a businesswoman in San Diego, to travel to Fayetteville, Arkansas and notify Donald's estranged mother, Luanne. A small town waitress, Luanne must overcome her own overt homophobia and learn to love her son unconditionally. In the process, Luanne cements a lasting friendship with Audrey, who is struggling with her own, less explicit, homophobia.

Reception
Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly magazine stated "Our Sons means well, and performances are above reproach. But it’s also an infuriating piece of work that insults the intelligence of everyone invoked, especially its audience". He gave the movie a score of D.

"While the movie is too talky and not poignant enough to be great television, it rates high for integrity" is the opinion of David Hiltbrand of People. He also said that Julie Andrews brings "enormous dignity and clarity to her role".

Co-producer Micki Dickoff later stated "a father in Philadelphia was so moved by the television movie, he reconciled with his AIDS-stricken child".
