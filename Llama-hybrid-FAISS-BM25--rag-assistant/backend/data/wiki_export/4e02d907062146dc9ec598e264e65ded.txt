Pop 'til You Drop! is the third studio album by Swedish pop group A-Teens, released in 2002 exclusively in North America and Argentina. Recorded between 2001 and 2002 in Stockholm, Sweden, the album saw the group having more involvement in the composition of the album, with the members having co-writing credits on several of the tracks. The first single from the album was a cover of Elvis Presley's "Can't Help Falling in Love", which was part of Lilo & Stitch's soundtrack. The second and final single from the album was "Floorfiller". The song "This Year" later appeared on the Kim Possible soundtrack.

The album peaked at #45 on the Billboard charts. The album was supported with their first headlining tour in the United States. Six months after the release of Pop 'til You Drop!, it was reissued for the European market as New Arrival.
