FF Dax is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Hans Reichel, published by FontFont library. The typeface is popular in advertising and in marketing. It is a "spurless" sans-serif, similar to typefaces like Semplicità and some characters in Gill Sans, where strokes end without terminals. This gives it a modernist, abstract feeling, detached from handwriting principles. Other designs, Barmeno and Sari, more bulbous cousins of FF Dax, have also been designed by Reichel.

In 2005 Hans Reichel reworked FF Dax into a cleaner, more mature text face called FF Daxline & FF Daxline Office Pro.

Adoption 
FF Dax is widely adopted in several advertising materials. It is also used as a branding font by a few organisations and companies.

The UPS Sans typeface, used in most of United Parcel Service branding since 2005, is a modified version of FF Dax. Wm Morrison, the British supermarket chain uses FF Dax on most in-store promotional material, hanging product location signs, and points of interest around the store – such as special offers and two-for-one deals.

The typeface was adopted in the United Kingdom by David Cameron in 2005 as part of the branding for his campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party. After Cameron was elected, the party was immediately rebranded in the style of the Cameron campaign, and Dax was used for a new version of the party logo and across all its subsequent advertising, leaflets and website, until being replaced by Lucida Sans in October 2006.
