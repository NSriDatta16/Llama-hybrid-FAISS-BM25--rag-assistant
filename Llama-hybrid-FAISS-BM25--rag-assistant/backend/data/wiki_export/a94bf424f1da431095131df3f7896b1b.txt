The Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden is a  botanical garden located at 8525 Garland Road in East Dallas, Texas, on the southeastern shore of White Rock Lake.

History
The majority of the grounds were once part of a  estate known as Rancho Encinal, built for geophysicist Everette Lee DeGolyer and his wife, Nell DeGoyler. The  Spanish-style DeGolyer House was completed in 1940. 

Since 1976, the DeGolyer Estate has formed a portion of the Dallas Arboretum & Botanical Gardens. The DeGolyer Restaurant/Loggia is located in the DeGolyer House, which overlooks White Rock Lake and A Woman's Garden. Also located on the grounds is an outdoor concert stage, picnic areas, and the  Rory Meyers Children's Adventure Garden with 17 indoor and outdoor galleries. The DeGolyer House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as well as the Texas Register of Historic Places.

In September 2002, Arboretum facilities were expanded with the opening of the new Visitors Center, named after Dallas developer Trammell Crow.

Named gardens
The Arboretum opened in 1984. Currently, there are 19 named gardens.

A Woman's Garden is composed of several smaller outdoor garden "rooms" and terraced walkways, including the Pecan Parterre and the Poetry Garden, which features a sunken garden of roses.The second phase of development opened to the public in the spring of 2006, and was designed by Dallas landscape architect Warren Johnson. It has a native Texas limestone bridge, a 140-foot hanging garden, and a wellspring surrounded by Dawn Redwoods. The purpose of designing these two gardens was to celebrate the strength, courage, creativity and nurturing demeanor of women.

The Nancy Rutchik Red Maple Rill
This  garden includes a collection of over 80 varieties of signature Japanese Maples planted along the stream.

The area also includes a series of paved walkways and a stone bridge connecting the Martin Rutchik Concert Stage to the Magnolia Allee. A large weeping Japanese maple, nearly 100 years old, is in the center of the garden.

Opened to the public in 1994, Crape Myrtle Allee was originally funded by the Communities Foundation. Dedicated to John and Thelma Black by their daughter Peggy Braecklein, the Allee features a lane of crape myrtle trees, which replaced the original trees planted by the DeGolyers.

The Trial Gardens at the Dallas Arboretum were created for the purpose of expanding research efforts and providing information to the public.
