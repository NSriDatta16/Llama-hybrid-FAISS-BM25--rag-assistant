History
The school was named after the master-planned community of Green Valley which is located in northern Henderson. The school opened in the fall of 1991 with Carroll Johnston as the first principal and the first class graduating in 1993. Green Valley High School was the first high school since 1976 to open in Clark County School District.

Green Valley was the largest school in Nevada for three years. But as the number of schools in the district has increased to over forty schools, Green Valley's zoned area has decreased, greatly impacting the size of the school's population. While the school had 3,500 students in 1991, now the school has 3,030 students in the current 2020 school year.

In 2008, Green Valley became the first high school in the CCSD to randomly test its students for drugs. This was because a student athlete was apprehended with black tar heroin.

In 2004, Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney addressed a re-election rally in the school's gymnasium. Former President of the United States Bill Clinton toured the school in January 2008 before the 2008 Nevada Democratic caucuses.

In 2010, President of the United States Barack Obama held a Town Hall Meeting at Green Valley High School.

In 2014, former principal Jeff Horn moved to Assistant Chief Student Achievement Officer over GVHS and Kent Roberts became the new principal.

In 2019, the hit alternative band Imagine Dragons released the music video for their song "Bad Liar", which was filmed at the school.
