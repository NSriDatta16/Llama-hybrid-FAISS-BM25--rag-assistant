The Rallis family, also spelled Ralli, Ralles or Rallet in Romanian is the name of an old Greek Phanariote family, whose members played important political role in the history of modern Greece, Danubian Principalities and later in the United Kingdom. One branch of the family, living in Great Britain, gained the title of Baronet in 1912 and thus became the Ralli baronets. They claim descent from the Frankish-Byzantine noble Raoul/Ralles family.
