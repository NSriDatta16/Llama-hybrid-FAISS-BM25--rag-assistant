Praia do Cassino 
(Portuguese for Casino Beach) is the world's longest sea beach and is located in the southernmost of the Brazilian coast (), on the South Atlantic Ocean, in the Rio Grande do Sul state. It is the longest uninterrupted sandy seashore in the world, with various sources measuring it from  to , stretching from the Molhes (breakwaters) at the entrance of the Rio Grande seaport in the north to the mouth of the Chuí Stream, on the border with Uruguay, in the south.

Etymology
The word “cassino”, in Brazilian Portuguese, literally means ”casino” (a gambling establishment) in English. The beach is named “Casino Beach” as, historically, tourists used to be able to gamble and play various games like Poker, Craps, and Blackjack within the luxury hotels overlooking the beach and the Atlantic.

History
Praia do Cassino is known as the oldest, most popular public beach in Brazil, dating back to 1890. The area was developed by the Suburban Mangueira Company to be a tourist destination. The director of the company (Antonio Condido Sequeira) and his investors, acquired the land and beach area with the help of the state government, debuting with a tourist complex on January 26, 1890. Over time, this tourist center became very popular, with big companies interested in investing in it. At the time, Brazilians of mainly European descent (German, English, Portuguese, and Italian, predominantly) often traveled to the beach to enjoy the sea, gamble at the casinos, and relax in the luxury hotels. The persecution of Italians and Germans during World War II, and the subsequent ban on roulette in 1948, had a lasting impact on the region's economy. However, in modern times, the Praia do Cassino area has witnessed a resurgence in local popularity.

On November 12, 1966, during a total solar eclipse visible from Praia do Cassino, NASA scientists and the U.S. Army launched several rockets to study the upper atmosphere.

Praia do Cassino was recognized as the world's longest beach by Guinness World Records in 1994.

The largest beach ultramarathon race in the world is held on this beach, the Cassino Ultra Race. The marathon is a long-distance race that sees participants traveling a distance of 230 km over the sand, though it can also be run in the 73K and 135K modality. It begins at Praia Barra del Chuí and ends at Praia do Cassino.

Tourism
Around 150,000 tourists visit Praia do Cassino every year. During the summer season, especially from December to January, the number of tourists visiting this place increases. Tourists can be seen participating in various activities including swimming and surfing. This beach is home to the largest number of seals in the world. Many tourists visit these seals by boat.

Tourist attractions

West Jetty

At the extreme point of the beach, a jetty was built with tons of stones that invade the open sea. Its formation, along with the Molhe Leste, on the other side of the navigation channel, protects the entry and exit of ships to the Rio Grande. At Molhe Oeste it is possible to take a cart, powered by sail, which slowly slides along the tracks into the ocean until it reaches the lighthouse tower. The trip takes about 20 minutes and covers a length of 4.3 kilometers. On the way you can still be lucky enough to see dolphins and grebes.

The resort has a carnival that brings together hundreds of people, with several carnival groups brightening up this resort-neighborhood.

Stranded ship

Sixteen kilometers from the center of the Casino towards Chuí, the ship Altair has been stranded on the edge of the beach since June 1976, after facing a strong storm.
