Together they showed their patriotism for America in using all resources possible in order to aid in the hunger and well-being of the soldiers during war by handing out large pans of cheese and bread. "Her husband before joining the army had purchased a mold for casting bullets, and Mrs. Draper herself now transformed her platters, pans, and dishes into balls for the guns of the Continental Army"

Mary Draper was once again widowed in 1775 at the age of 56 just three months before the battle of Lexington. Her oldest son, Moses, joined the Patriot army. He was 31 and had a family of his own. She helped to the best of her abilities by giving food and servicing the wounded. She housed many people who were homeless as a result of war.

Her daughter Kate and her maid helped her make their own cloth into coats for the Colonial soldiers, sheets and blankets were made into shirts and flannel already made up into her clothes was turned into men's clothing. She also melted family heirlooms for bullets and gave them to the soldiers in war. Mary Draper was an influence on the American Revolution. Her view on war was that she wanted to go to war to gain American freedom. She died at the age of 91.
