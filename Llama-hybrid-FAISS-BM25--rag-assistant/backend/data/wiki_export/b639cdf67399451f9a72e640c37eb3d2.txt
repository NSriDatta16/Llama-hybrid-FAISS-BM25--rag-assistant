NFU Mutual is a UK insurance composite. It is a mutual, therefore, its policyholder members own the business, and the executives and directors are ultimately accountable to them. The full name of the organisation is National Farmers' Union Mutual Insurance Society Limited.

The business is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, with complaints oversight available via the Financial Ombudsman Service. NFU Mutual Risk Management Services Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NFU Mutual), is not regulated by these bodies.

History 
In 1910, the Midlands Farmers' Mutual Insurance Society Ltd was formed by seven farmers in a tea shop in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. The company promised to provide insurance for fire, workmen's compensation and all other kinds. The scheme was confined to members of recognised farmers' unions and premiums were charged at established insurance rates with a discount of 15%. 

Policy numbers started at 501 because they wanted to falsely represent the level of establishment of the business.

John William Lowe was elected the first chair in 1910 and held that post until his death in 1918. James Robertson Black was the first secretary, and his farmhouse was the first office. In 1912, he became the inaugural managing director. He served the society for 42 years, becoming vice-chair in 1946 and holding the post until his death in 1952. The first accounts (1911) show income of £311 and profit of £16. By 1919, premiums had grown to £4,345 and profit to £1,825.

As early as 1912, the farmers' union in Lincolnshire had approached the directors for advice about forming a mutual insurance company. They were advised to join the mutual in the Midlands that was already in existence.

In 1919, the society became the official insurer of the National Farmers' Union (itself established in 1908) and changed its name to the one it bears now. The Society was managed by 16 directors, eight appointed by the NFU and eight appointed by the Midlands Farmers' Society. Membership of the new Society was open to NFU members only and the discount on premiums increased from 15% to 20%. Within a year, premium income shot up from £9,790 to over £70,000. Ralph Chisholm joined the staff during this period and went on to become the first CEO.

The First World War saw a rapid increase in the amount of land in cultivation, which allowed NFU Mutual to gain a 50 per cent increase in income.

In 1920, offices were established in Stratford-upon-Avon. One of the first directors was Sir Basil Brooke who went on to be Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and revived the Ulster Volunteer Force as a paramilitary organisation. 

In 1922, NFU Mutual became the official insurer of the NFU of Scotland.

In 1928, NFU Mutual successfully applied to the High Court to set up a life assurance business. In its first full year, the insurer wrote more than £100,000 of sums assured. It also set up its final-salary pension scheme for the benefit of its employees. By 1930, income from premiums had risen to just under £316,000 and the Mutual had increased in size to eight branches.

In the 1920s it emerged directors took mortgage loans from the business. These loans were repaid once this became a scandal.

In 1925, NFU Mutual set up a separate company to write non-farming business for the general public. It was originally called The Farmers' Commercial but changes its name to Avon Insurance in 1931, taking its name from the river in Stratford.

NFU Mutual also held balls between 1930 and 1970.

In the 1930s, NFU Mutual employed Sidney Carter, a former RAF boxing champion, to run a film unit. Anyone attending his film shows would be educated in current affairs and brainwashed about the benefits of membership. In the words of one agent it was 'the best bit of advertising we ever did'.

In 1933, taxation was introduced to cover the trading results of mutuals. This was reversed in 1944 when a tax case went to the House of Lords and the intention of the statute was defeated. The Finance Act of 1964 sought to reverse this defeat, and Edmund Chaumeton, the company secretary, led efforts to oppose regularising mutual tax affairs, a task that "every year successive governments [have been] expected to put it back in place".

By 1940/41, over 100,000 farmers held policies with NFU Mutual and premium income reached £1million with assets at £2million.

During World War Two, an employee Arthur Scarf was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

In the 1960s, NFU Mutual's assets reached £50m, but there was a significant outbreak of foot and mouth disease on UK farmers in 1967. The insurer had first offered insurance against this disease in 1949 but the devastation was so severe that in November 1967 it decided to stop taking new business. Support from reinsurers enabled the society to offer renewals to businesses who already had cover.

The current head offices are at Tiddington, and the 1984 building was designed by David Lloyd Jones for RMJM. It was one of the first to be designed around environmental sustainability.

In 1985, around 70% of NFU members were customers of NFU Mutual. The storm of 1987 produced over 13,000 claims and cost the Mutual £30m, but that was outdone by 37,000 claims received from the storm of January 1990 which cost £58m.

In the 1990s, managing director Andrew Young made some significant changes to the Mutual's operations, and the group focused on the need to grow beyond farming in order to spread their risks across a wider group of customers.

In 1996, NFU Mutual hosted the Scotland national football team at their headquarters in Tiddington, where they trained for the European Championships.

In July 1998 the Board put before the members proposals to change the Articles in order to bring in unrestricted access to all of the Mutual's products. This gave the Mutual freedom to insure anyone, irrespective of profession or occupation. To reassure its core farming customers that the change would not have an adverse impact, a product called Mutual Advantage was set up, exclusive to NFU Members and provided extra discounts and cover for farming customers.

In 2000, Group Premium Income passed £1 billion and the company introduced Mutual Bonus, which it claimed returned £94million to policyholders.

The same year saw attempts made to create shareholder ownership and accountability to the NFU Mutual.

Former NFU Mutual director John Murray initially approached five venture capitalists in the hope of launching a bid. Windfalls for members were anticipated. Commenting to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee on the possibility of demutualisation, Andrew Young, the then managing director said: "In our view, members of a mutual should... decide how the business is run, and if they are not satisfied, they should get rid of the Board and the management rather than demutualise."

In 2002, Andrew Young retired and was succeeded by Ian Geden, who came from a farming family near Stratford-upon-Avon and had joined the Mutual as a professional trainee in 1969. He became group chief executive in 2005 when that post was created. During his term, the general insurance premium income grew from £603m to £944m.

In 2007, a series of floods brought more than 13,000 claims representing a liability close to £100m.

In 2008, Lindsay Sinclair became Chief Executive (the first such appointment from outside NFU Mutual). He was Group Executive for more than 12 years, before retiring in March 2021.

In 2013, the NFU was placed second-bottom in a table produced by the Association of British Insurers for pensions annuities with only Scottish Widows providing a poorer product.

In common with a number of other such business studied, the historical tax payments of the business between 2011 and 2015 were investigated to consider whether they were evading taxes. 

In 2015 NFU Mutual closed two call centres.

There was a swimming pool at head office until 2016, when it was closed and filled in.

In 2019 protests against badger culling were undertaken at the head office.

In March 2021, Nick Turner became chief executive.

The drought of 2022 saw a huge growth in farm and combine harvester fires which cost the Mutual around £100m in claims.

NFU Mutual has also announced that more than 20,000 customers made claims worth a total of £170m for Storm Arwen in 2021 and Storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin in 2022.

That year the Annual report stated "A Principal Risk and Uncertainty is that NFU Mutual's customer base changes substantially beyond expectations."

Following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NFU Mutual revealed it would divest from its Russian holdings.

NFU Mutual reported receiving over 5000 complaints (representing 3 complaints per 1000 policies) in the period 1 July 2022 - 31 December 2022.

In 2022 NFU Mutual won several industry fraud awards. In the same year, NFU Mutual's Claims Validation Technical Manager David Phillips became chair of the General Insurance Fraud Committee of the ABI.

NFU Mutual was Which? 'Insurance Brand of the Year' for 2022'. In 2023, NFU Mutual was the only Which? recommended provider of home insurance.

The business apologised in 2023 to a third party couple whose garden and swimming pool had been destroyed by a member of NFU Mutual and their buffalo herd: only after The Guardian newspaper got involved did the insurer address the 30 percent underpayment settlement offer and lengthy delays.

Recent financial performance 
In 2023 the business reported losses in excess of -£1.04bn for 2022.

Commenting on the billion pound loss, the finance director, Richard Morley, said “a combination of factors affected our investment and General Insurance result in 2022 and these led to the Group reporting an overall loss.

At the end of 2021, its total funds under management were £22.2bn, but these had dropped by £3bn to £19.2bn in 2022. 

In 2020 the business reported a loss of -£143m. 

In 2019, the Group made a profit of £573m. In 2018, the Group posted losses of over a quarter of a billion pounds.

The business currently underwrites around £1.825billion in annual general insurance premiums for UK policyholders.

In the summer of 2023 NFU Mutual repeatedly attended a meetings with the Bank of England, Prudential Regulation Authority about stress testing its insurance business.

Solvency 
In 2022, NFU Mutual's solvency ratio improved by 14% to 218%. The NFU Mutual has asked the Prudential Regulation Authority to reduce the scale of reserves required for it under Solvency II Regulations. This reduced solvency obligation is still in place for NFU Mutual.

Accountancy 
In 2022, the Financial Reporting Council asked about declarations regarding its exposure to Business Interruption claims because of requirements of section 21 ‘Provisions and Contingencies’ of FRS 102s . The FRC stated NFU Mutual 'provided a satisfactory response'.

Governance

Membership 
The management and conduct of the business is ultimately done under the authority of the members/policyholders who are senior to the directors and executives and may dismiss them.

There are around 900,000 members of the NFU Mutual. As NFU Mutual has no shareholders, a proportion of its profits, if any, are returned to policyholder members in the form of an adjustment on quoted premiums of renewing customers. A discount of between 8.5% and 13.5% (2022/2023) is provided which the business brands "Mutual Bonus".

Under NFU Mutual's articles of association, each policy generates a distinct right to speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM), scrutinise the accounts, and hold the management to account, as well as an ownership right in the business.

The AGM is generally held at the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, Warwickshire and is open to all policyholder members.

In 2022 the business stopped circulating minutes of AGMs.

Resolutions at the AGM of 2023 passed with 97.51% and 99.78% support.

NFU Mutual was written to by the Equalities Minister in 2018 about its non-engagement with the Women in Finance Charter and signed it in 2018.

Climate change 
In 2022, NFU Mutual announced a carbon reduction strategy relating to its own operations and the impact of its investments. Targets include a 25% reduction in the business's own emissions by 2025 and a 50% reduction by 2030. To support this, NFU Mutual said it aims to maintain 100% renewable electricity purchase for its occupied premises. For its investments, the insurer is targeting a 50% emissions reduction in its equity and corporate bond portfolio by 2030.

In 2020, Ethical Consumer criticised NFU Mutual for "just talking about the climate impact of their offices" rather than the far more significant impact of their investments. NFU Mutual responded saying: "We avoid areas we consider harmful such as predatory lenders, certain munitions, and climate-unfriendly companies with no plans to help decarbonisation."

Services and products 
NFU Mutual offers personal and business as well as motor private and commercial motor insurance. They specialise in agricultural insurance. 

NFU Mutual sell life insurance products including term assurance, critical illness, and income protection through AIG.

The business also offers various investment and pension products, including ISAs and With-Profit funds, and sells financial advice and inheritance tax planning.

Relationship with farming unions 
NFU Mutual is the official insurer of the main farming unions of the UK, and has a long-running affiliation with them. Each year the insurer makes significant financial contributions to the UK farming unions, donating around £7m to them in 2021.

The insurer's associations with each union began as follows: National Farmers' Union of England and Wales (1919); NFU Scotland (1922); Ulster Farmers' Union (1930); Manx NFU (1947); and Scottish Crofting Federation (1986).

Agencies 
NFU Mutual sells policies predominantly through a network of agents. Agents were traditionally Group Secretaries of the NFU. The Union, as employer, paid them a salary and the Mutual paid them commission. At the end of 2018, NFU Mutual had over 3,800 employees, and 654 agents working out of 310 offices.

Islands Insurance 
NFU Mutual acquired the Islands Insurance Group in 1987, providing access to NFU Mutual products for customers in the Channel Islands.

Avon Insurance 
Avon Insurance was established in 1925 to provide insurance to non-farming customers. The establishment of this enterprise was opposed by the NFU hierarchy and the NFU Mutual directors were required to agree that they would "consult on such matters in future". Business increased in the 1970s at 25-30% each year, and Avon opened an underwriting room near Lloyd's insurance market in 1977. In 1975, Avon became one of the first companies to introduce index-linking of sums insured to protect customers against inflation. Avon closed to new business in 2013.

Other insurance operations 
In 1929, NFUM bought another farming insurance company, Northern Farmers. Between 1948 and 1974, NFUM had operations alongside unions in Central and East Africa, including what was then known as Rhodesia and Kenya. Operations in Kenya ceased in 1964 and Rhodesia in 1974.

Charitable work

NFU Mutual Charitable Trust 
NFU Mutual set up a Charitable Trust in 1998 to deal with need concerned with 'agriculture, rural development and insurance.' In 2022 it pledged to donate £1m to 'national and regional charities' as part of NFU Mutual's overall donation of £3.25m to charity. In 2022 it donated £30,000 to help the NFU support and expand its education projects. In the past 24 years the independent charity has distributed funds averaging around £250,000 per year. In 2022 the NFUM Charitable Trust pledged £150,000 to Disasters Emergency Committee's Ukraine Appeal.

Farm Safety Foundation 
In 2014, NFUM set up the Farm Safety Foundation, an independent charity to help young farmers challenge their behaviours and change their attitude to farm safety. The foundation aims to have zero avoidable deaths on farms and runs an annual Mind Your Head campaign concerning mental health issues.

Agency Giving Fund 
In 2020, NFU Mutual set up a fund for its agency offices to use in order to distribute money to charities in their local communities. A total of £1m was distributed in the first year. In 2021, the Agency Giving Fund distributed £2m to charities and in 2022 it has distributed £1.92m.

Property dealing and development 
In 2021, NFU Mutual bought a unit near Milnrow for £27 million, and also committed to spending £100 million on six sheds near Clowes.

Also in 2021, NFU Mutual's plans to invest in a warehouse in Witney attracted over 190 objections. NFU Mutual responded saying the warehouses would create 150 jobs that will benefit the local economy and will add much-needed high-quality space to the area. In April 2022 NFU Mutual's management allocated in excess of a further £20 million of members' funds to this speculative investment with its commercial partner Tungsten.

In March 2022 plans were announced to build a speculative £34 million shed in Staffordshire. Work has since began on the shed. 

In April 2022, a shed was traded with Valor for £50 million.

In July 2022, NFU Mutual sold eight warehouses to American-based investment firm Barings LLC for £234m and the negotiations were described as "contentious" when the deal completed in 2023.

In October 2022, along with partners Apache, Harrison Street, NFUM obtained a loan of £70 million from Deutsche Bank to finance a £150 million build-to-rent development in Liverpool. A 325 rental-home unit neighbourhood in Liverpool was funded with NFUM capital and loans and opened in late 2022. It is reported to be the UK's largest build to rent project.

In May 2023 it was revealed that the business was to sell another £90m worth of real estate assets.

NFU Mutual has recently liquidated retail assets on London: 24 Old Bond Street was sold for £141m; 3/5 Bond Street was sold for £151m.

Research and reports 
Each year, NFU Mutual issues a Rural Crime report based on its claims data. In 2023, the report showed rural crime cost the UK an estimated £49.5m in 2022, an increase of £9m from the year before. The 2022 edition of the report indicated that rural crime cost the countryside £40.5m in 2021, down from £44.7m in 2020.

In October 2022 the business released research indicating their customers had "put a hold on their [investment] plans while ... assessing uncertainty overshadowing" them.

Since 2016 NFU Mutual has produced an annual responsible business report to make assertions around support of its communities and members.

Notable people 
During World War II, Arthur Scarf, an employee was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

A former First World War pilot, George Lindsay, was NFU Mutual General Manager between 1944 and 1955.

A former chairman of NFUM is Lord Curry of Kirkharle.

Noteworthy court cases 
In Smith (Leah) v National Farmers Union Mutual Insurance Society Limited and Robinsons Services Limited [2019] NIQB 37, the company denied liability for an accident sustained during an employee's attendance at work, but the court found against the company.

In 2017, Preston-based law firm Barber & Co were ordered to pay costs to NFU Mutual after the firm represented a claimant in an injury case without instruction. Barber & Co lost the case and HHJ Peter Hughes referred the case onto the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service for further action. The law firm claimed the case was the result of "two non-qualified fee earners creating false documentation."

In 2016 NFU Mutual denied liability for a £128,000 bill for damage to a cottage from a burst water pipe. NFU Mutual lost the case and was ordered by Mr Justice Holgate to pay £100,000 in legal costs on top of the damage.

In 2010, NFU Mutual sought compensation from HSBC towards fire damage to a property on the basis of double insurance but the judge agreed with HSBC and NFU Mutual was liable for the full extent of the claim.

Controversies

Frauds 
In 2011, employee Gordon Murray was jailed for his fraud on the members of £400,000.

In 2018, Iain Wishlade also an NFU employee, was jailed for submitting a fraudulent payment request from his business LDK Ltd to NFU Mutual.

Business interruption and Covid-19 

NFU Mutual sold policies which were the subject of examination in the Financial Conduct Authority test case on business interruption payments during Covid. Following the first instance decision in the High Court and the appeal in the UK Supreme Court in this case the business published a statement saying judgment of the court meant it had no liability to meet claims for COVID-19 related business interruption.

One policyholder involved said: "They have quite happily taken the premiums for the last 15 years but the one time I need it I'm not going to get any help off them. It's disgusting that the insurance industry is allowed to do this".

In April 2020, an NFU Mutual customer questioned the insurer's position on business interruption in evidence to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.

In 2022 (following the handing down of the UK Supreme Court decision in the FCA test case), plans to bring proceedings in a group action against NFU Mutual with Penningtons Manches Cooper LLP acting as solicitors were announced. A lawyer involved said: "We expect this represents only a very small number of potentially hundreds of NFUM policyholders possibly affected."

In a Chartered Institute of Insurance podcast at the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020, Nick Turner (at the time sales and agency director, and subsequently CEO) stated that the company would "have to work to renew trust with certain customers", but that this would be "challenging". Turner accepted that policyholders not receiving business interruption payments could impact their welfare and mental health in this same podcast, a point reiterated in commentary by chairman Jim McLaren in another podcast, who said: "And you mentioned mental health and it's a crucial area and one that's often overlooked other than by those who are suffering from real mental health challenges. And again, the Mutual recognises that."

Missing cover 

In February 2023 it was reported in the Insurance Post that "complaints over missing cover for Covid-related booking cancellations upheld."

Covid-19 grants 

In November 2020, following criticism and campaigning the company's conduct in deducting COVID-19 support grants from its payments triggered by COVID-19 were called into question in debate in the House of Commons with John Glen MP stating: "I am aware that NFU Mutual has continued to make such deductions. As stated in my letter, these grants are intended to provide emergency support to businesses at this time of crisis, and it is the Government's firm expectation that they are not to be deducted from business interruption insurance claims."

Executive pay 
The issue received negative attention in 2011, with the Insurance Times quoting an observer as saying: "Only two words come to mind – and they are 'snout' and 'trough'.
