Dhundhari (ढूंढाड़ी; also known as Jaipuri) is a dialect of Rajasthani spoken in the Dhundhar region of northeastern Rajasthan state, India. Dhundari-speaking people are found in four districts – Jaipur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, Tonk and some parts of Sikar and karauli district

With some 1.5 million speakers, it is not the largest speaking dialect in Rajasthan, though fairly used in the regions mentioned above. Dhundhari is spoken widely in and around Jaipur.

According to G.A.Grierson, Jaipuri is the form of speech of Central Eastern dialect of Rajasthani, which means literally the language of Rajasthan. MacAlister completed the grammatical analysis on 24 February 1884. Books on Jain philosophy, such as Moksha Marga Prakashak, have been written in Dhundari by Acharyakalpa Pt. Todarmalji. The Serampore missionaries translated the New Testament into Jaipuri proper in 1815.

Etymology 
It is called Dhundhari as it was mainly spoken in the Dhundhar region. The state was divided into-Marwar, Mewar, Dhundhar, Hadoti, and Vagad. These divisions were based on culture and language. Now there is no such division and the districts which fall in that region are the ones listed above. Most of the Dhundhari-speaking population is in Jaipur and hence, the name Jaipuri.

The derivation of the name ‘Dhundhari’ is thought to be from two origins.

 According to the first opinion, Dhundhari is believed to have drawn its name from the Dhundh or Dhundhakriti mountain, which is situated near Jobner in Jaipur District or in the West frontier of the State.
 The other opinion is that it is named after a river called Dhundh flowing through this region. Hence the name became Dhundhar. This tract is the place lying to the southeast of the range of the hills forming the boundary between Shekhawati and Jaipur.

Geographical Distribution 
Dhundhari is primarily spoken in the state of Rajasthan. Mewati is another dialect of Rajasthani to the northeast, which assumes the form of Braja Bhasha in Bharatpur. Mewati is actually the language of the former Mewat, the abode of the Meos in  Dang is a further sub-dialect of Braja Bhasa in Karauli and that of Bundeli and Malvi in Jhalawar and the southern parts of Kota.

Vocabulary 
Dhundhari vocabulary is somewhat similar to other Western Indo-Aryan languages, especially Rajasthani. A little similarity can be traced between Dhundhari and Gujarati too. However, elements of grammar and fundamental terminology differ enough to significantly impede mutual intelligibility. Dhundhari also uses some words of Sanskrit which are not a part of Hindi now.

Writing System 
Dhundhari is generally written in Devanagari script. Though not very much use of written Dhundhari is seen nowadays.

Usage 
Though Jaipuri is used as a mother tongue in the home domains, the usage varies since the younger generation use Jaipuri mixed with Hindi. Jaipuri is used in the public places of the locality and the market among the Jaipuri speakers. Though Jaipuri is not taught as a separate subject or as a medium of instruction in the schools, oral communication and teaching is done mostly through Jaipuri language in the rural areas where Jaipuri speakers are in dominance. Many people in the last years have migrated to Hindi and stopped using Dhundhari altogether and this trend continues. It reduces the actual number of speakers in the census.
