Early life

He subsequently made many appearances on British television, his credits including Space: 1999, I, Claudius, Special Branch, The Sweeney, Return of the Saint, The Pallisers, Anna Karenina, The Professionals, Tales of the Unexpected, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Old Men at the Zoo, The Jewel in the Crown and Prime Suspect. His biggest success was as Alan Stewart in the 1979 thriller serial Running Blind.
