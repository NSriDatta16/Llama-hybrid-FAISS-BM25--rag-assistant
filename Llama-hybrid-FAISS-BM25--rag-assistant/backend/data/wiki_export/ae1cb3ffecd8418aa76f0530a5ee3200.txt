Stadion Miejski im. Józefa Piłsudskiego (), also known as Polonia Bydgoszcz Stadium (), is a multi-purpose stadium in Bydgoszcz, Poland. It is used mostly for speedway and association football matches and is the home stadium of Polonia Bydgoszcz speedway and football teams. The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 people and was opened in 1924 by president Stanisław Wojciechowski.

History
The stadium has hosted the Final of both the old Speedway World Team Cup in 1995 and the Speedway World Cup in 2014. It has also hosted 16 Speedway Grand Prix events including the final of the 2008 season which was actually run as the FIM Final Speedway Grand Prix. The final was to be the Speedway Grand Prix of Germany and held at the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen, however the FIM deemed that track to be unsafe due to the inclement weather (despite the Veltins-Arena sporting a retractable roof which was closed at the time the track was laid) and the GP was re-staged a week later in Bydgoszcz.

Poland's 2010 World Champion Tomasz Gollob is the most successful Grand Prix rider at the track, winning 7 of the 16 Grand Prix held in Bydgoszcz including the first GP held there, the 1998 Speedway Grand Prix of Poland.

The speedway track at the stadium is  in length. Tomasz Gollob is the track record holder with 60.11 seconds for a 4 lap race with a clutch start. Gollob set his time on 20 June 1999.
