Ontario Knife Company (OKC) was an American manufacturer of knives and military tools. On August 1, 2023, OKC was acquired by Blue Ridge Knives and subsequently closed.

History 
Better known as a supplier of military knives, Ontario Knife Company was founded in 1889 in Naples, New York. It is currently located in Franklinville, New York, in Cattaraugus County, where most of their products are manufactured.

The company has historically supplied the U.S. military with products such as the M7 bayonet, the USAF Survival Knife, the M1942 Machete, the Navy MK3 MOD 0 diving/survival knife, the M9 bayonet, and most recently, the USMC OKC-3S Bayonet.

Military production 
OKC's "Randall's Adventure & Training" survival knives were designed in conjunction with Randall's Adventure & Training, a popular outdoor survival training and expedition company. The lineup includes the original RTAK (formerly produced by Newt Livesay Blades), and the TAK-1 and RAT-7, both of which have been adopted by the U.S. military.
 
Ontario Knife Company has also collaborated with other designers such as Justin Gingrich, Bram Frank, and Bowie Knife knife-maker Bill Bagwell, introducing lower cost renditions of several of Bagwell's designs.

In addition to their sporting/outdoor knives, Ontario Knife Company produces a range of other cutlery and tools including Old Hickory kitchen cutlery, industrial and agricultural products, and sci-med scientific tools and instruments. Ontario Knife Company is also major supplier of private label blades and knives.
