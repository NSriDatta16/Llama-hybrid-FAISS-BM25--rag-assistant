Periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) are stem cells found near the periodontal ligament of the teeth. PDLSCs have shown potential in the regeneration of not only the periodontal complex but also other dental and non-dental tissues. They are involved in adult regeneration of the periodontal ligament, alveolar bone, and cementum.  The cells are known to express STRO-1 and CD146 proteins.

PDLSCs play a role as progenitor cells. They are capable of generating into into osteoblasts, cementoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes.
