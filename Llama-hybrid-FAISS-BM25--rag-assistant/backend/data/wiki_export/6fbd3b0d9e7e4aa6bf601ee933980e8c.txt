Maurice Froomes "Moss" Christie (18 September 1901 – 19 December 1978) was an Australian freestyle swimmer of the 1920s who won a silver medal in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. His involvement in various national and state championship events continued for 2 decades from 1917 until 1937. During this time he won 13 National freestyle titles, 7 NSW freestyle championships whilst providing substantial contribution to the Drummoyne Amateur Swimming Club.

Combining with Boy Charlton, Ernest Henry and Frank Beaurepaire, the Australians trailed the Americans (featuring Johnny Weissmuller - later to star as Tarzan the Ape Man) home by almost nine seconds, in a race conducted in the River Seine.  Christie had a disappointing campaign in the individual events, being eliminated in the heats of the 100-metre and 1500-metre freestyle and being disqualified for a false start in his heat of the 400-metre freestyle.
