History 
The MLC School Society (Mylapore Ladies’ Club) established a Kindergarten Section on 3 February 1956 to accommodate the boys in Mylapore and its environs. The first president of the society was R. S. Subbalakshmi, supported by M. Subbaraya Aiyar, a leading lawyer, and Mrs. Padmini Chari who was an educationist. Thus the school was born through the efforts of these three, and Vidya Mandir Matriculation School was formally opened in 1960. R. S. Subbalakshmi and Mrs V.K.T Chari served as the Founder President and School Correspondent respectively. M. Subbaraya Aiyar became the Secretary of the school.

In 1960, once the school was formally opened as a boys school, the first batch of students took the exam. In 1963 a small building was constructed and the matriculation section was opened. The school followed the matriculation system until 1975 when it became affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). 1978 was a significant year as the first batch of students took the 10th Standard examination and the school became a co-educational school.

In 1981, to commemorate the 25th year, a Silver Jubilee Kindergarten Block was constructed. In 1989, the school established a branch school located in Gandhi Nagar, Chennai which later became an independent school called Bala Vidya Mandir.

In 1993, a new primary block was constructed and in 1997 a new administrative block was constructed. In 2001, a new open air theatre was built to host the school cultural activities and other school events and a library was built in the same year.

In 2010 the school introduced a filing system and shifted to a two term year from a three term year as prescribed by the CBSE.
