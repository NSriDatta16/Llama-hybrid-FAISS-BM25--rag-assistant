"Ólavur Riddararós" is a song by Faroese folk metal band Týr, released as a single in October 2002 by Tutl. The song is an adaptation of the Faroese ballad of the same name, a variant of the Elveskud ballad. 

This is the only Týr release to feature Allan Streymoy's vocals, who joined the band after Pól Arni Holm's departure. The band considers, in retrospect, Streymoy's hiring and the single's release to be a "rash decision".
