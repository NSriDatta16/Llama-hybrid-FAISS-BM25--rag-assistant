Tolga-Os is a former municipality in the old Hedmark county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1966 until 1976. It included all of the present-day municipalities of Tolga and Os. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Tolga.

History

Historically, the municipality of Tolga had always included Os until 1926 when Os had become the separate municipality of Os. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1966, the neighboring municipalities of Tolga (population: 1,944) and Os (population: 2,015) were merged to form the new municipality of Tolga-Os. Soon after the merger, there was discontent in the new municipality. On 10 April 1975, the government allowed the merger to be dissolved, so on 1 January 1976 Tolga (population: 1,865) and Os (population: 1,859) became separate municipalities once again using the pre-1966 borders.

Name
The municipal name was created during the 1960s (and in use until 1976) for the newly merged municipality that was made up of the old municipalities of Tolga and Os. The name was simply a hyphenated combination of the two old names. The first name comes from the old Tolga farm since the first Tolga Church was built there (in 1688). This name comes from the small river which flows through the area (now known as the river Tolja). The name of the river may come from the word  ( which means "young pine tree". The second name comes from the old Os farm () since the first Os Church was built there in 1703. The name is identical with the word  which means "mouth of a river" (here it is referring to the Vangrøfta river running out into the Glomma river).

Government
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
