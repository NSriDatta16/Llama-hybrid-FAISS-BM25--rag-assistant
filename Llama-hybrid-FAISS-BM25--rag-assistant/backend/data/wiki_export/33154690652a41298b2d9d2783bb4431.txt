Wynne Prakusya (born 26 April 1981) is a former tennis player from Indonesia.

Her first appearance in a professional tournament occurred in 1996, when she was 14 years old. She formally went professional in 1998. Over her career, she has won two WTA doubles titles, nine ITF singles titles and 17 ITF doubles titles. As a junior, her highest achievements includes reaching the 1998 Australian Open junior finals and the 1998 Wimbledon junior quarterfinals.

Her first appearance at a WTA event took place in September 1997 at the Wismilak International in Surabaya. The first time she won a match in the WTA Tour was in the 1999 Wismilak International in Kuala Lumpur. In 2000, Prakusya began to attempt qualification for the main draws of major tournaments. She also began to appear primarily at WTA rather than ITF events. Her first win in the main draw of a major came in the 2001 Australian Open, in which she and partner Janet Lee reached round two in the women's doubles. Her first tournament win on the WTA Tour was in the doubles draw of the Stanford tournament in 2001, again with partner Janet Lee.

She and Lee also qualified for the WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles in 2002.

She represented Indonesia at the 2004 Summer Olympics, this time partnered by Angelique Widjaja. Prakusya successfully represented Indonesia at the 2002 Asian Games, the 2005 SEA Games and the 2007 SEA Games, winning seven medals in total.

She was part of the Indonesia Fed Cup team in every year from 1996 to 2005. She was part of the 2004 team which saw Indonesia return to the Fed Cup World Group: in that year, Prakusya won 11 of her 12 Fed Cup matches.
