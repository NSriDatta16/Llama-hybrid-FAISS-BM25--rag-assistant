World Ag Expo is the largest annual outdoor agricultural exposition with over 1,200 exhibitors and an attendance of more than 100,000 each year. It is held at the International Agri-Center in Tulare, California, in the United States, starting on the second Tuesday of February. It has officially been designated by the U.S. Department of Commerce as an affiliate of the Foreign Buyer Program, which encourages export of American-made goods. Prior to its 2001 rename, the event was called the California Farm Equipment Show and International Exposition.

Contests
The show features an innovation contest among its exhibitors each year. The World Ag Expo Top-10 New Products Contest highlights new agtech, equipment, services, and more. Exhibitors must apply for the contest and their submissions are reviewed by a panel of judges. The winners are featured at the show and are covered widely in the media.

Milestones
