"Only U" is a song by American singer Ashanti from her third studio album, Concrete Rose (2004). The song's introduction uses a sample of Club Nouveau's 1986 song "Why You Treat Me So Bad". "Only U" is a rock-tinged song, that finds Ashanti in love and willing to do anything to be with the one she loves, no matter the cost.

Released on October 18, 2004, as the album's lead single, the track reached number thirteen on the US Billboard Hot 100 in January 2005. It peaked at number two in the United Kingdom and number four in Ireland, becoming her most successful single in both countries. The song received generally favorable reviews from music critics, with most praising its sensual lyrics, guitar riff and her vocal performance.

Background and release 
After her successful second studio album Chapter II (2003), which topped the Billboard 200 chart and was certified Platinum, spawned two hit singles, "Rock wit U (Awww Baby)" and "Rain on Me", and earned her three Grammy nominations, Ashanti released her first Christmas album called Ashanti's Christmas in 2003. However, the album received overwhelming negative reviews and did not provide much success on the charts.

Later in September 2004, she collaborated with Ja Rule and R. Kelly on the track "Wonderful" for Rule's sixth studio album R.U.L.E. The song was a success, topping the UK Singles Chart and peaking inside the top 10 in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, as well as reaching the top 20 in Ireland, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany. A month later, on October 18, 2004, "Only U" was serviced to US urban radio, and on October 26, the song was released through iTunes and Amazon as the lead single from Ashanti's third studio album, Concrete Rose (2004). The song was released to radio stations on January 11, 2005.

Remix 
The official remix was included on Ashanti's 2005 compilation album Collectables by Ashanti, and features Caddillac Tah, Young Merc, Ja Rule, and Black Child. There is a second official remix that replaces Caddillac Tah and Young Merc with Dipset rappers Cam'ron and Juelz Santana.

Composition and lyrics 
"Only U" was written by Ashanti, Seven Aurelius, and Irv Gotti, with production handled by the latter two. "Only U" is a rock-tinged song. The song's introduction uses a sample of Club Nouveau's 1986 song "Why You Treat Me So Bad", followed by a guitar riff, taken from the song "Presence" by Aurelius. Lyrically, "Only U" has Ashanti imagining a man providing sexual pleasure for her, finding herself always standing by his side or looking for reasons to be close to him, acting out of character and falling for him more with each day.

"Oh I can't wait to get next to you/ Oh I just can't leave you alone/ Boy you got me doing things that I would never do," she sings. In the chorus, she emphasizes that the guy is only one who makes her feel in love and turned on, "Only u can make me feel and only u can take me there," she chants.

Critical reception 
"Only U" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Hattie Collins of The Guardian called it "a deliciously dark song." Chuck Arnold of People Magazine wrote that "the rock-edged 'Only U,' show Ashanti truly blossoming." Khalil Regarty of The Age called it "a No. 1-single-by-numbers in which Aurelius' Linkin Park-style guitar riffs sit atop a shuffling beat the Trackmasters or the Neptunes could have put their hands to." Low Key of MV Remix wrote that "'Only U' finds Ashanti taking a risk with a rock-influenced sound, which thankfully works out well. Ashanti sounds better than ever over Seven Aurelius smashing guitar riffs and ambient sirens, making for one of her best efforts yet." Steve Jones of USA Today praised the song for having "engaging beats and airy vocals," writing that "it works well."

"The Bland Is Out There" review was positive, writing that, "The beat complements Ashanti's slight voice It's the one single so far which has fit right into her range. There isn't any high-pitched screaming or an excess of 'baby's' for her to sing. 'Only U' is...worth a listen." Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times was mixed, writing that the song "revolves around a corroded keyboard line that sounds distinctly menacing - that is, until Ashanti arrives, singing, 'Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you'." Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it a "promising edgy, rock-leaning" song.

Music videos 
There are two official versions of the video, both directed by Hype Williams and shot in Vancouver and Mexico City. It is notable for making use of a blue-hue effect in numerous shots with overt noir and neo-noir influences in many shots. The first version is the original video (which has an alternate version itself) and the second version is the Dance Version, which was only aired on BET.

Original version 
The original version is shot in widescreen format but the slots that are normally left black at the top and bottom of the screen were replaced with upside down or reversed images of the main shot in the middle of the screen, which flickered back and forth to give the illusion that two scenes were playing at once. The alternate version had the scenes shown in regular widescreen format with the shots and the top and bottom of the screen plain black. It opens with a Blade Runner-inspired environment and imagery of Ashanti's face projected onto a skyscraper—similar to a scene in Blade Runner. In addition, there is a scene where she is sitting down on a seat while smoking as she appears to be watching something through a projector—again, a shot similar to that of a scene in Blade Runner. The rest of the video features Ashanti in various situations, posing and wearing a variety of outfits. In one scene, Ashanti is in the shower and in another she is inside a cocoon-like lamp as air gushes from beneath, creating a vacuum effect—reminiscent of the scene in Blade Runner where Zhora goes to dry her hair inside a clear, fishbowl-like dryer. The video ends with her and a group of female dancers performing the song in concert. Bottles of Herbal Essences hair products are seen during the shower scene as Ashanti was the then-new spokesperson for the haircare company. Seven Aurelius, who co-wrote and produced the song, makes a guest appearance at the beginning and at the end of the video playing the guitar.

Dance version 
The "Dance version" of the video consisted of the dance scene that is also shown at the end of the original video, with Ashanti and the back-up dancers dancing throughout the entire video. Seven Aurelius makes a cameo appearance in this version as well at the beginning and at the end of the video as the guitar player. Director Hype Williams featured his signature style of widescreen format in this version of the video also, except the slots that are normally left blank at the top and bottom of the screen were replaced with upside down or reversed images of the main shot in the middle of the screen.
