Ground

The club initially played behind the Jolly Sailor pub near the Castle Grounds in Tamworth, using an old double decker bus as changing rooms. They later moved to Morrows' Field, located to the rear of the Gate Inn in Amington, before purchasing some allotments on Rene Road from a local farmer in 1959 for £350.

The new Rene Road ground was opened in August 1961 with a friendly against Tamworth WMC. A 150-seat stand known as the "Welcome to Bolehall Swifts Stand" was built behind one goal, with the standing only "Founded 1953 Stand" on one side of the pitch.
