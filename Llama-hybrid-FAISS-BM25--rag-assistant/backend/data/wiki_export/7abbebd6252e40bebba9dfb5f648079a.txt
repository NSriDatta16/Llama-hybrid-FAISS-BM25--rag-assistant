Political career
During NFL off-seasons, Turner worked as an intern for Congressman Duncan Hunter. After retiring from football, he accepted a full-time job in the congressman's office. In 2006, he ran for the vacated seat of California's 50th congressional district in the 2006 special election to replace Duke Cunningham. In the blanket primary election held April 11, 2006, Turner finished eighth out of 17 candidates.
