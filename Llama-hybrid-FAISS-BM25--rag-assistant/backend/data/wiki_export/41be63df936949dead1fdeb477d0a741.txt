Notable events 
In 2006, a Claymont Elementary school teacher was arrested for first-degree rape, and providing alcohol to a minor, after it was discovered that she had sex with a 13-year-old male student twenty-eight times. She also allowed for the child's 12-year-old friend to watch them and provided them with alcohol. She pled guilty to a single count of second-degree rape and received a mandatory minimum 10-year sentence.

A federal lawsuit was levied against the district in 2016, as a mis-identification and subsequent search discovered weapons in a students bag, caused a 5-day out of school suspension. After the mis-identification was discovered the father raised the suit of potential Fourth Amendment violations, when he discovered the suspension would stay on his sons record. The lawsuit led, to students and their personal property cannot be searched without a parent or guardian present.

In 2018, a blue school bus was unveiled to help feed students during the summer when school is out of session, and funded through the USDA's Summer Food Service Program. District Supervisor of School Nutrition Pam Gouge, highlighted the need for the bus as nearly half of the districts students qualify for a free or reduced lunch, and the Food Bank had pulled out of areas. That year also saw the district participating in the National School Walkout, organized by the survivors of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.

In 2019 it was announced that a middle schooler from the district was invited to sit with Melania Trump for the 2019 State of the Union address, after reports that he was bullied as he shares the same last name as President Donald Trump.
