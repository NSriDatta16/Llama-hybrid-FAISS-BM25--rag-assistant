State Trunk Highway 35 (STH-35, WIS 35) is a Wisconsin state highway running north–south across western Wisconsin. It is 412.15 miles in length, and is the longest state highway in Wisconsin. Portions of WIS 35 are part of the Great River Road.

Route description
WIS 35 is a major north–south route through westernmost Wisconsin, often following close to the state border. Because of the lower population of counties along the state's western border with Iowa and Minnesota, it is a mostly rural routing with lower traffic counts than in other parts of the state. WIS 35 is also the terminus of 15 different state, US, and Interstate highways along its route.

Illinois state line to Prairie du Chien
The southern terminus of WIS 35 is at the Illinois–Wisconsin border,  north of East Dubuque, Illinois. It continues on into that state as Illinois Route 35 (IL 35), which is the shortest state highway in Illinois.

From the state line, WIS 35 continues north for about a mile (1.6 km) before intersecting with WIS 11 at Badger Road. This section of highway is the only segment of WIS 35 between the state line and Prairie du Chien, with the exception of the stretch between WIS 81 and Bloomington, that is not co-signed with at least one other highway.

WIS 35/WIS 11 continues to the west to the interchange with U.S. Highway 61 (US 61) and US 151, as the two US Highways enter Wisconsin after crossing the Mississippi River from Dubuque, Iowa.

WIS 11 terminates at the Welcome Center on the other side of US 61/US 151, while WIS 35 continues north with the two US routes on an expressway to the city of Dickeyville. WIS 35 and US 61 exit the freeway to the northwest into Dickeyville at exit 8, while US 151 continues north towards Platteville.

WIS 35 and US 61 continue to the northwest to the village of Tennyson before heading north towards the city of Lancaster. On the outskirts of Lancaster, WIS 35 and US 61 interchange with WIS 81, which continues on into the city with the other two routes.

At South Harrison Street, WIS 35/WIS 81 heads south for two blocks before turning southwest and out of the city.

About a mile (1.6 km) outside the city limits of Lancaster, WIS 35/WIS 81 turns in a westerly direction for about  before the two highways split up in rural Grant County. WIS 81 continues southwest towards Beetown, while WIS 35 heads northwest toward the village of Bloomington.

On the northwest side of Bloomington, WIS 35 intersects with WIS 133 at 4th Street. The two highways continue in a generally northerly direction towards the village of Patch Grove, where they intersect with US 18.
