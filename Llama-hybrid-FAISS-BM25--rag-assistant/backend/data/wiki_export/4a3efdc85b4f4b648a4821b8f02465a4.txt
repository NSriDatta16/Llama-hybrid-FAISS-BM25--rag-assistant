The Manila Standard is a broadsheet newspaper in the Philippines. , it is owned by the Romualdez family. The Romualdezes, through incumbent speaker of the House Martin Romualdez, also own Journal Publications, Inc., the owner of tabloid papers People's Journal and People's Tonight.

Initially established as the Manila Standard in 1987, it merged with another newspaper, Today,  on March 6, 2005, and became the Manila Standard Today (MST).  In 2015, the newspaper renamed itself as The Standard (temporarily The New Standard), before reverting to its original name in 2016.

History

The Manila Standard was founded on February 11, 1987. The offices were then located at the bustling Ayala Avenue in the Makati CBD.

In 1989, the group of Andres Soriano III bought out the Elizalde group and renamed the company Kagitingan Publications and relocated the offices in the Port Area, Manila.

In June 1991, the group of businessman Alfonso Yuchengco bought into the company and spun off the publishing company. It was incorporated as Kamahalan Publishing Corporation. Kagitingan Publications was renamed Kagitingan Printing Press Inc., which continues to print the New Standard.

In 1997, businessman Enrique K. Razon Jr., chairman and president of the International Container Terminal Services Inc., acquired the shares of the Yuchengcos and bought out the Soriano group to become the sole owner of Kamahalan Publishing Corporation and Kagitingan Printing Press Inc.

Victor Agustin took over as chairman of the Editorial Board in 2008. Under his term, the company formally adopted an advocacy for the environment.

In 2010, just as the Aquino administration took the reins of power, ownership of the Manila Standard Today changed hands again. This time, the Razon group sold its interest to the Romualdez group as Razon established Bloomberry Resorts & Hotels Corporation, owner of the Solaire Resort & Casino.

The newspaper once again was relaunched as The Standard, featuring a tallboy broadsheet format. The format is bigger than tabloids and smaller than newspapers, with pictures as the main inset of the front page. The new format was first implemented in the weekend issues before the full makeover happened in the weekday issues since February 23, 2015.

The Standard was named as the Newspaper of the Year during the 2015 Rotary Club of Manila Journalism Awards for its scoops on hot button issues, like the Mamasapano incident and the Bangsamoro Basic Law payola issues.

On July 25, 2016, the paper reverted to its broadsheet format, and it was renamed as the Manila Standard, the newspaper's original brand name in time for President Rodrigo Duterte's first State of the Nation Address.
