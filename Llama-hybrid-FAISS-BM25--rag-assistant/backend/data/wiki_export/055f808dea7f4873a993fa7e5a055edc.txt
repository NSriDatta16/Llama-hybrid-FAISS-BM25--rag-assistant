Abdulah Gegić (, ; 19 March 1924 – 21 June 2008) was a Yugoslav and Serbian football manager of Bosniak ethnicity, who also held Turkish citizenship.

Biography
As a player, he played with Metalac Beograd and with Mačva Šabac in the Yugoslav First League.

Gegić began his coaching career as coach of Serbian clubs FK Bor and FK Radnički Niš, and later of the Yugoslav u-21 team, and also the Yugoslavia national football team. He coached Partizan where he reached the Final of the European Champion Clubs' Cup (today known as the UEFA Champions League) in 1966 where he saw a 2–1 defeat against Real Madrid. He was named the second best coach of Europe by France Football magazine. If Gegić had won the final, he would have been named the new coach of Real Madrid.

Gegić then went to Turkey to coach Eskişehirspor, where he became very successful and led the club to many victories. He also coached Beşiktaş (1972–1973), Fenerbahçe (1975–1976) and the Turkey national team.

Gegić is nicknamed Futbol Profesörü (Football Professor) by the Turkish press. In 1979, he took Turkish nationality and became a citizen of Turkey. He is still an important figure in Turkish football having mentored most of the top Turkish coaches of today such as Fatih Terim, Mustafa Denizli, and Şenol Güneş.

On 4 June 2008, in Novi Sad, the 84-year-old Gegić had a stroke and died 17 days later.
