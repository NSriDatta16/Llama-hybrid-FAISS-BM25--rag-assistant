James Christian Albus (born June 18, 1940) is an American professional golfer.

Early life and amateur career 
Albus was born in Staten Island, New York. He attended New Dorp High School, and went on to Bucknell University, where he was a successful baseball player. It was while he was at college that he took up golf, which was unusually late for a future pro. He transferred to UCLA and graduated in 1965.

Professional career 
In 1968, he became a golf professional and worked as a club professional at courses that included La Tourette Golf Course and Piping Rock Club. He won a number of local and regional tournaments while he was a club professional and played in five U.S. Opens and seven PGA Championships. He was Met PGA Player of the Year in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1988. Albus' greatest success came after he turned 50 and began playing on the Senior PGA Tour, now known as the PGA Tour Champions, where he has won six tournaments, including a senior major, the 1991 Senior Players Championship.

Albus has been inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame as well as the PGA Metropolitan Section Hall of Fame.  He played his last event associated with the PGA Tour organization in 2009.
