Lowdham railway station is a Grade II listed railway station which serves the village of Lowdham in Nottinghamshire, England.

History
It is on the Nottingham to Lincoln Line, which was engineered by George Stephenson and opened by the Midland Railway on 3 August 1846. The contractors for the line were Craven and Son of Newark and Nottingham; the buildings were probably designed by Thomas Chambers Hine.

The buildings originally comprised a combined station building and station master's house, a weighbridge hut at the entrance to the goods yard, a goods shed, and stables for the horses that drew the drays to deliver goods. A waiting room, a porter's room and a lamp hut were on the opposite platform from the station building, and a signal box across the road on that side, next to the level crossing. The signal box was opened on 14 June 1896. This Midland Railway Type 2b box was the oldest on the line when abolished in 2016.

In 1953 the station made national headlines when a train stopped blocking the level crossing for 45 minutes as the engine driver, Fred Jones and his fireman David Mews had "a few words". The driver stopped because he thought there was not enough water in his boiler and he blew the fire out. The fireman thought there was enough pressure in the boiler for them to continue. The driver requested water for the engine and a relief fireman. Many of the passengers alighted from the train and shouted angrily whilst the driver and fireman held a discussion. British Rail supplied a relief fireman and a relief driver to resolve the situation.

The station was Grade II listed on 13 May 1986.

The main station building is now in private ownership; it has been renovated and used to exhibit items on the history of the Midland Railway. In 2016, the line was re-signalled by Network Rail, making the signal boxes at Lowdham redundant. The signal box closed on 1 October 2016 when control transferred to the East Midlands Integrated Electronic Control Centre at Derby

In 2017, the Nottingham-bound platform was extended to compensate for the reduction in usable platform caused by the positioning of one of the new signals.

In October 2020, the 1896 signal box at the level crossing was removed overnight to be restored by charity Lowdham Railway Heritage as a museum.
