History
Before the 1950s, most of lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania was rural farmland. In 1922, Langhorne Borough and Middletown Township signed an agreement to create Langhorne-Middletown High School at the corner of Cherry Street and Maple Avenue. By 1946, Langhorne Manor, Penndel, Hulmeville, and Lower Southampton agreed to participate in the expansion of Langhorne-Middletown High School. However, their plan changed when William J. Levitt announced his plan to establish Levittown, one of America's first planned communities, partially located in Middletown Township. Because of Levittown and other new housing developments, the district needed a new high school. Neshaminy High School opened in 1953, covering grades 7 through 12.

In the early 1970s the population went up to 3,500. As the district continued its rapid expansion in the 1960s, Neshaminy High School underwent multiple expansions. However, the community eventually decided that it needed a second high school. In 1975, Neshaminy-Maple Point High School opened in the district's northern end; the existing Neshaminy High School became Neshaminy-Langhorne High School. Shortly after its opening, the community saw a rapid population decline, leading to the closure of Neshaminy-Maple Point only eight years after it opened. Once again, the entire district attended a single Neshaminy Senior High School for grades 10 through 12. The name of Neshaminy High had reverted from Neshaminy-Langhorne High School. The former Neshaminy-Maple Point High School reopened in 1993 as Maple Point Middle School and included grade 9.

In 2003, the Neshaminy School Board proposed demolishing the current school building and constructing a new facility on the same school grounds. This plan was priced at $100 million and required an $85 million tax-funded bond. In April 2004, residents voted against the new building referendum due to its cost.

As an alternative plan, the school board decided to demolish sections of the school and rebuild them as the school year proceeded. This major renovation project was estimated to cost $72 million and would replace 95% of classroom facilities. The existing auditorium, gym, cafeteria, and library were not replaced because they had significant renovations as recently as 1995. When construction finished in September 2009, the school welcomed ninth graders back for the first time in three decades.

Campus
Neshaminy High School consists of a main building with a central hallway and branching hallways organized by department. There are two gymnasiums, one at the front of the school and one at the back.

For the event, the student body divides into the Blue (last names A-K) and Red (last names L-Z) teams. For two nights in late winter, the two teams compete in relays and dance exhibitions designed and choreographed by the student.

 Mascot 

Neshaminy High School athletic teams are known as the Skins. The prior mascot was the Redskins.In 2012, a Neshaminy parent of Native American descent started a campaign to change the name because of its racially offensive and harmful nature. This parent spoke at numerous board meetings, though Neshaminy made no progress toward a change. As a result, a complaint was filed with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) in 2013. After a thorough investigation, the PHRC ruled against the Neshaminy school district, deciding that the school must change the mascot. However, the school administration appealed PHRC's ruling.

On October 23, 2013, the student editorial board of the high school's newspaper, "The Playwickian", stated its intention to no longer call the team "Redskin" in its publications. The school administration responded that the student editorial board lacked the power to make this decision. In 2014, newspaper staff members received awards from the Scholastic Keystone Press Awards contest and the Gold Circle Award from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association for articles published in "The Playwickian" on the issue.

In May 2014, a student submitted an opinion editorial containing the "Redskin" term. The school's Principal McGee demanded that "The Playwickian" run the piece and threatened to withdraw the newspaper's final issue if its staff did not comply. "The Playwickian" ran its last issue of the year without the article. The principal confiscated the newspaper, calling for an emergency meeting with its co-editors and restricting access to "The Playwickian's" social media and website.Foolish action and reaction - The Intelligencer: Editorials Later, McGee defend his actions in a statement on the school's website. On June 26, 2014, the Neshaminy School Board gave "The Playwickian" authority to ban the term "redskin" in articles, but required the paper to publish editorials and letters to the editor with the term present and unedited.

In 2015, the PHRC made a preliminary finding that the name Redskins is "racially derogatory" and creates a "hostile educational environment." The case then proceeded to a full committee hearing. After six years of controversy, the PHRC held a hearing in January 2019. In November 2019, the PHRC ruled that Neshaminy High School could continue to use the name but must cease using any imagery promoting negative stereotypes of Native Americans. In addition, PHRC required the school to teach its students about Native American history to prevent the use of stereotypes. The school district spent over $400,000 in legal fees in its campaign to retain the Redskin nickname.
