James J. Hines (December 29, 1903 – May 11, 1986) was an American professional golfer.

Early life 
Hines was born in Mineola, New York.

Professional career 
In 1920, Hines "got his start" at Wheatley Hills Golf Club. Four years later, he got a job as assistant professional at Hempstead Golf Club. He worked there for eight years. Later, he worked as professional at Timber Point and Garden City. On October 26, 1937, Hines became the new professional at Lakeville Golf Club.

Hines won nine times on the PGA Tour and was selected to the 1939 Ryder Cup team but the event was cancelled due to World War II.

On the 13th hole at the 1938 PGA tournament, his chip shot hit opponent Sam Snead's ball, sending both into the cup. A birdie two was awarded to both players, who were tied at that point. Snead wound up beating Hines by one stroke.

Personal life 
Hines died in Monterey, California.
