Opened in 1957 as Bilborough Grammar School, the school became a sixth-form college in 1975 when Nottingham's education system became comprehensive. The college has grown from 635 students to 1600 full-time students enrolled to be attending the college in September 2016.

The new accommodations opened officially on 21 July, 2006. The new building is divided into 3 blocks (A, B, and C), and 4 floors (0-3). The new building has a photographic lab, lecture theatre, theatre, shop, refectory, large art rooms, library, and "soundproof" music rooms.
