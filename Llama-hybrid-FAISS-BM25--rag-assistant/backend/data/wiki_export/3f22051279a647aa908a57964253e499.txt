As a commoner
On October 14, 1947, Prince Kuni Asaakira and his children lost their imperial status and became ordinary citizens, as part of the American Occupation's abolition of the collateral branches of the Japanese Imperial family. As a former naval officer, he was also purged from holding any public office. Hoping to capitalize on his close ties to the throne (his sister was the empress), former prince Kuni Asaakira started a luxury perfume line carrying the imperial chrysanthemum logo. However, since few Japanese had money to purchase luxury items during the American Occupation, the Kuni Perfume Company quickly went bankrupt. He later became president of the Japan Shepherd Dog Association, and an avid orchid grower, and held posts in the Association of Shinto Shrines, the religious corporation which succeeded the government in the control of Shinto shrines.

The former prince died of a heart attack at age 57 and his elder son Kuni Kuniaki (born March 25, 1929) succeeded him as titular head of the former Kuni-no-miya family.
