The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, was a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represented different segments of the specialty coffee industry, including producers, roasters, importers/exporters and retailers.

In 2005, management discovered that former Chief Operating Officer Scott Welker had embezzled more than $465,000. SCAA members contributed a quarter of a million dollars beyond their membership dues to keep the organization running. In 2009, the U.S. Federal Court in Santa Ana, California sentenced Welker to 33 months in federal prison.

In January 2017, the Specialty Coffee Association of America and the Specialty Coffee Association of Europe merged into one Specialty Coffee Association or simply SCA. The new SCA has more than 10,000 active members.
