Hawley is a small village in the Hart district of northeastern Hampshire, England.

The village is contiguous with the small town of Blackwater. It is on the western edge of the Blackwater Valley conurbation, about  northwest of central Farnborough, Hampshire, about  west of Camberley, Surrey and about  west-southwest of London. Hawley is directly north of Cove, a large, suburb of Farnborough, with a relatively long history.

History
The first written record of Hawley is from 1248, in the Compotus De Crundal, spelt as Halely, Halle and Hallee and later in 1280 as Hallegh.  And spelt as Hallie and Halley in Documents relating to the Foundation of the Chapter of Winchester AD 1541–1547, published by Hampshire Record Society in 1888. The name is likely in true Old or Medieval English Healhleah or Healhaleah meaning nook clearing or nook meadow. Historical spellings also include Hawleye, Halle and Hallie.

The tithings of Yateley and Hawley were, as before, listed as parcels of the manor and the hundred of Crondall in 1567. The parish of Hawley was created out of that of Yateley in 1838, a few decades before the secular aspects of such were fully ceased as civil parishes were rolled out.

Parish church

The Church of England parish church of Holy Trinity in what is often, being a relatively modern full place name, considered 'Blackwater'. built in 1837 J.B. Clacy of Reading enlarged the church in 1857. Charles Buckeridge expanded it further in 1863, adding the chancel arch, chancel rib-vaulting and apse. The tower and spire were added in 1882. The building is in a Gothic Revival style of about AD 1300 and is listed Grade II (listing 26 June 1987).

The parish's second church, All Saints', South Hawley is where Chapel Lane meets Fernhill Road.

The church parish contains all of any zone traditionally or normally considered Blackwater, see map at Diocese of Guildford.

Film location

Hawley Lake and the surrounding woodland is often used as a feature film location, including part of the opening sequence of the 2002 film Die Another Day in which James Bond is in North Korea. It also used for the obstacle course and lake scenes in Spies Like Us, starring Chevy Chase, the 2005 film Sahara and scenes from the second Johnny English film Johnny English Reborn, notably the cable car station. The BBC filmed episodes of It Ain't Half Hot Mum at the lake in the 1970s. In April 2014, the woodland to the east and south of the disused airstrip was used as a filming location for the 2015 superhero movie Avengers: Age of Ultron. Throughout early 2017, sets were built for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom in the woodland.
