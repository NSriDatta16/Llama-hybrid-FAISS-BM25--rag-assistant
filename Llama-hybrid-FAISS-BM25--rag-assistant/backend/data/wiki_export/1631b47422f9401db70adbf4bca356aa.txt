Description
It is a high-powered, light-weight vehicle with high acceleration for short- and medium-distance services with frequent stops. The aluminium superstructure was built as flat as possible, both to minimize drag and to ease automated cleaning. The acceleration is achieved by distributing traction motors among eight of the train's ten axles including two of the three jacobs bogies.

It is based on the Class 423 design, but lacks a third set of doorways in the centre of each car.
