In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the category of elements of a  presheaf is a category associated to that presheaf whose objects are the elements of sets in the presheaf.

The category of elements of a simplicial set is fundamental in simplicial homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology. More generally, the category of elements plays a key role in the proof that every weighted colimit can be expressed as an ordinary colimit, which is in turn necessary for the basic results in theory of pointwise left Kan extensions, and the characterization of the presheaf category as the free cocompletion of a category.

Definition
Let  be a category and let  be a set-valued functor. The category  of elements of  (also denoted ) is the category whose:
 Objects are pairs  where  and .
 Morphisms  are arrows  of  such that .

An equivalent definition is that the category of elements of  is the comma category , where  is a  singleton (a set with one element). 

The category of elements of  is naturally equipped with a projection functor  that sends an object  to , and an arrow  to its underlying arrow in .

As a functor from presheaves to small categories
For small , this construction can be extended into a functor  from  to , the category of small categories. Using the Yoneda lemma one can show that , where  is the Yoneda embedding. This isomorphism is natural in  and thus the functor  is naturally isomorphic to .
