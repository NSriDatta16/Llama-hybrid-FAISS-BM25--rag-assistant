International venue
It was the first cricket ground in West Pakistan to host a Test match, when it hosted the second Test of Indian cricket team in Pakistan in 1954–55, India's inaugural tour of Pakistan. However, this was the only Test match to be held at this ground. As of 2002, 155 first class matches and 23 List A matches have been played at this ground.
