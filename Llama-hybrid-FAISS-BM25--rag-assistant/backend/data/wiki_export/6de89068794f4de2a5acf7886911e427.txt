On 23 May 2009, Paea was the subject of a controversial racial vilification dispute with Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks captain, Paul Gallen, late in the local derby played between the Dragons and Sharks. Gallen, who took objection to Paea accidentally stepping on his hand in a tackle, got up and called Paea a "black cunt". Paea's angry response was caught by television cameras and microphones, but he did not wish to take the matter further after the match. After the match, Paea said, "But then something told me to just forget about it and to just move on. Things happen on the field and you don't want to get too personal about it. But I've been getting different kinds of reactions. After the game I had my church friends sending me messages saying, 'You handled it really well, it was very Kingdom the way you dealt with it'. Then I had other mates saying, 'You should have smashed him'."

Nevertheless, the NRL decided to step in and issued a $10,000 fine to Gallen.
