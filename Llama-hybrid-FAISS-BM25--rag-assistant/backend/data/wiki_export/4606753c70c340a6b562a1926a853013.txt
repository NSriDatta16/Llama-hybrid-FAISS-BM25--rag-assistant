Club career

Servette
Being a young striker he played just one year for the second team, time in which he scored seven goals in ten appearances.

Politehnica Timișoara
He was a pacey striker, with good heading skills. After a short spell at the Servette, the young Senegalese arrived in Timișoara before the start of the Divizia A 2004–2005 season. He was one of the most spectacular players of Politehnica Timişoara and one of the club's most promising young players in 2006. In the summer of 2009, he returned to Politehnica Timişoara, but he was injured for 6 months. On 22 September he scored 1 goal in 3–1 victory in Romanian Cup against Juventus București. Later, he got injured again.

CS Buftea
After a mistake in his transfer clause to Dinamo București in 2007 he was kicked out from both teams and he did not train properly for months. Politehnica Timişoara agreed to let him back into the squad in 2008, and he was loaned out to the second league club CS Buftea where he scored 9 goals in 13 games. Politehnica Timişoara's coach Dušan Uhrin, Jr. wanted him back at the team, but this did not happen, as Dušan Uhrin was sacked before the winter break.
