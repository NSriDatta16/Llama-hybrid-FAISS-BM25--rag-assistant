Alp Er Tunga or Alp Er Tonğa (Alp  "brave, hero, conqueror, warrior", Er "man, male, soldier, Tom", Tonğa "Siberian tiger") is a mythical Turkic hero who was mentioned in Mahmud al-Kashgari's Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, Yusuf Balasaguni's Kutadgu Bilig and in the Vatican manuscript of Oghuznama by an unknown writer.

In Turkic literature he is considered to be the same character as Afrasiab in the Persian Epic Shahnameh. He is sometimes mentioned as a khan of Saka (Scythia).

The Karakhanids claimed to have descended from Alper Tonga.
