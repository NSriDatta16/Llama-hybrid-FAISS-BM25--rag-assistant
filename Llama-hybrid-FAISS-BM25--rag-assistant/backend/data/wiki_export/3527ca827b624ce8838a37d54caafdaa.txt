The All Pakistan Federation of Labour (APFOL) is a national trade union centre in Pakistan. It was founded in 1951 by Rahmatullah Chaudhary.

In 2004, APFOL officeholders and other labour leaders demanded the repeal of an anti-labour law, called the Industrial Relations Ordinance (IRO)-2002, from the Pakistani government.

The APFOL merged into the Pakistan Workers' Federation in 2005 which, in turn, is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation based in Brussels, Belgium.
