Robert Norfleet (born July 7, 1958) is an American former professional racing driver. He has raced motorcycles, drag cars, and in stock car racing, which included attempts in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and the ARCA Re/Max Series.

Racing career

NASCAR / 2000 controversy
In 2000, Norfleet announced he would field and drive his own team in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, but was unable to come up with sponsorship. In an effort to help Norfleet, Brian France, who at the time was NASCAR Vice President, called a number of companies who were interested in sponsoring a NASCAR team, and even flew in some company executives, to see if they could work a deal and sponsor Norfleet so he could attempt races. Norfleet came up with sponsorship from 40 Street Records and So So Def Records. Norfleet failed to qualify for his first race at Martinsville Speedway.

Norfleet made his NASCAR debut at the Portland International Raceway road course. He competed against Bill Lester in that race. Norfleet qualified 11 miles per hour slower than the pole speed, but made the race after 33 cars qualified for 34 spots. He finished 32nd after he suffered handling problems. He was also black-flagged three times by NASCAR for not maintaining the required minimum speed. By comparison, Lester ran the full race and finished 24th.

In the next race at Pikes Peak International Raceway, Norfleet's entry was denied by NASCAR officials, as he was not licensed to run tracks larger than a mile. NASCAR requires drivers to either show proficiency on shorter tracks, or have some experience on one mile and larger tracks in a lower series before they are allowed to race on larger tracks. Norfleet claimed the decision was racially motivated, and people protested outside NASCAR's headquarters. After failing to qualify for his next race at Evergreen Speedway, he stopped running NASCAR; he stated he intended to file suit over the issue, though no suit was filed.

Post-racing career
Norfleet returned to NASCAR as a car owner in 2005. Bobby Norfleet Racing fielded the No. 24 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Mike Harmon in a Busch Series race at Memphis Motorsports Park, but the entry failed to qualify. Norfleet had announced his team would compete in the Busch Series and the NEXTEL Cup Series in 2006, but did not field an entry.

Personal life
Norfleet's sister, Tessa "Dime" Norfleet, and brother, Lucas "Big Bod" Norfleet, are both known for their modeling and sports careers.

He also has a daughter named Tia who attempted to follow in her father's footsteps and reach NASCAR, but only competed in one race in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series. Tia became the first African American female to obtain a NASCAR license.

He currently resides on an estate in central New Jersey where he coaches young athletes and teaches them the lessons he learned in his brief career.
