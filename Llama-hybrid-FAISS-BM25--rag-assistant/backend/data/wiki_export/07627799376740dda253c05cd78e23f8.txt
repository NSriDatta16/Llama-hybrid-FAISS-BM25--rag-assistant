History
A large perforated stone axe was found in the village, suggesting occupation during the Neolithic Period.

The village appears in the Domesday Book as Wiresuelle, an outlying estate of Marbury. Like much of the land in the Nantwich hundred it was then held by William Malbank, having been earlier held by Earl Harold. The Domesday Book describes it as being 'waste', suggesting that any settlement might have been destroyed during the suppression of the rebellion of 1069–70. In 1288, it formed part of the barony of Wich Malbank. In 1656, Wirswall (then spelled Wyrsal) was held by the Hinton family.

Wirswall was formerly a township in the parish of Whitchurch, in 1866 Wirswall became a civil parish, on 1 April 2023 the parish was abolished to form "Marbury and District".

The population was formerly 103 (1801), 83 (1851), 138 (1901) and 169 (1951).
