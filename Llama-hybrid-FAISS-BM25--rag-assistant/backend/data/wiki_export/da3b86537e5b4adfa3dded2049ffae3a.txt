The CHL Humanitarian of the Year Award is given out annually to the Canadian Hockey League player judged to have made the most notable contribution to his community in a humanitarian sense. It is chosen from the winners of the QMJHL Humanitarian of the Year, the Dan Snyder Memorial Trophy (OHL), or the Doug Wickenheiser Memorial Trophy (WHL).
