History
Popovka railway station was open in 1874. It was a part of Tsarskoselsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate. On November 20, 1918 the uyezd was renamed Detskoselsky. On August 12, 1922 Detskoselsky Uyezd was merged with Petergofsky Uyezd to form Gatchinsky Uyezd (since 1923, Trotsky Uyezd). On February 7, 1927, Popovka was transferred to Leningradsky Uyezd. The governorate was renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924.

On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kolpinsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Kolpino, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. The station of Popovka became a part of Kolpinsky District. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On August 19, 1930 the district was abolished. Krasny Bor became a part of newly established Tosnensky District. On August 20, 1935 Krasny Bor, which had the status of suburban settlement, was upgraded to urban-type settlement. During World War II, Krasny Bor was occupied by German troops. In 1943, the Battle of Krasny Bor took place here.
