Meaford is a hamlet in the civil parish of Stone Rural, in the Stafford district, in the county of Staffordshire, England. It lies at the junction of the A34 and A51 roads, north of Stone on the River Trent. Meaford Lock is on the Trent and Mersey Canal. Meaford's most famous son is John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent, the naval hero.

Meaford was for the later part of the 20th century easily identifiable from the main A34 road by the coal-fired Meaford Power Stations, operated by the CEGB and later National Power.
