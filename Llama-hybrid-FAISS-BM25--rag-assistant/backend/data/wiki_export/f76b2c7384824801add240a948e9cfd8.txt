History
KSSS aired an adult contemporary format as "Kiss 101.5" until 2001, when it switched to classic rock as "Kiss 101", before switching back to an AC format as "Star 101", and returning to classic rock as "101.5 A Rock & Roll Station". The station tweaked its music and imaging as "Rock 101" in 2005.

By the summer of 2011, "Rock 101" tweaked to a full blown mainstream rock format playing a mix of classic rock and rock from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, to current active rock music.
