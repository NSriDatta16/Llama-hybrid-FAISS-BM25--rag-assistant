The Barristers' Ball is an annual event held at most law schools in common law countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.  It is generally a formal/semi-formal affair, often near the end of the academic year, conducted by the institution's Student Bar Association as a school-wide gathering.
