Darren Stark  is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Todd MacDonald. He made his first on-screen appearance on 20 July 1993 and was originally played by Scott Major. When the character was released from prison in 1996, MacDonald took over the role and remained with the show until 1998. MacDonald has since returned twice for guest stints, plus a cameo appearance in the serial's twentieth anniversary episode.

Casting
Actor Scott Major originated the role when the character appeared in a recurring capacity for three months in 1993. Producers decided to reintroduce the character in 1996. Thousands of actors auditioned for the role, including 19 year old Todd MacDonald. MacDonald's audition and the subsequent recalls were held in Sydney. He was then flown to Melbourne, where the actors were "whittled" down to five, before MacDonald was told he won the part. MacDonald was "thrilled" about being cast. He later admitted that he was worried about being typecast in a soap opera, so he only signed up for one year, but he later agreed to do a further six months. He felt the show gave him "valuable experience in front of the camera".

MacDonald remained with the show until 1998, but returned seven years later for a ten-week guest stint. In April 2005, Kris Green of Digital Spy revealed that MacDonald would be reprising his role to join many ex-cast members returning for the show's 20th anniversary episode. In November 2007, David Knox of TV Tonight reported MacDonald had returned to Neighbours once again.

Development
Major described Darren as "really aggressive and completely out for himself." Darren's presence upon his return causes "a stir", as he has recently been released from juvenile detention. Darren immediately sets his sights on Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). 
 
Darren's final storyline involves him kissing Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor-Cotter), which leads to the breakdown of his relationship with Libby. Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois) witnesses the kiss and reveals all, because she is feeling vindictive. Describing Libby's reaction to Darren's cheating, Valentine told TV Week: "She'll find out early in the new year & it's a case of, "He's done it again!" When it happens, she says, "That's it! It's enough now." Then, in the next few months, there is a hint of romance for Libby & Dan."

Other appearances
In 2005, four novellas based on characters from Neighbours were released. The books were available to buy online and at some Australia Post outlets. Darren and Libby Kennedy were the focus of one of the books entitled Facing Tomorrow. It explains what happened after the couple left Erinsborough in 2004 and follows their new life together. Of the books, a spokeswoman said "It's different to what happens in the show; it's more like a fantasy of what happens, might have happened, in the show, they would take about an hour to read if you're a quick reader".

Reception
While played by Major, Sharon Black of the Evening Herald called the character a "detention-centre trouble-maker". He was also branded a "bad guy" by Clare Horton of Huddersfield Daily Examiner, and a "bad boy" by a writer for British weekly magazine NOW.
