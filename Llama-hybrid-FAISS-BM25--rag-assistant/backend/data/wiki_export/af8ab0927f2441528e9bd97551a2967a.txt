"I Think I Love You" is a song by Tony Romeo, written as the debut single for fictional musical TV family the Partridge Family, released in August 1970, a month prior to the debut of the ABC-TV musical sitcom The Partridge Family starring Shirley Jones and featuring David Cassidy, both of whom appear on the record, with Cassidy as lead vocalist. The single topped Billboard's Hot 100 for three weeks in November and December 1970 and later was certified by NARM as the best-selling single of 1970.

The single also reached number one in Canada on the RPM 100 national Top Singles chart in November 1970, and in 1971 peaked at number one in Australia.

Background and release
The single, which was produced by Wes Farrell and issued on Bell Records, featured twice on the TV show during the record's seven-week climb to number one on Billboard's Hot 100. Cassidy lip-synched his performance, as he did for all songs throughout the four-year series. As with all of the Partridge Family's studio output, the single features musicians associated with iconic Los Angeles-based session players "the Wrecking Crew": Dennis Budimir, Louie Shelton, Tommy Tedesco, Joe Osborn, Max Bennett, Larry Knechtel, Mike Melvoin, and Hal Blaine. And members of overlapping studio groups the Ron Hicklin Singers and the Love Generation – brothers John and Tom Bahler (also spelled Bähler), Ron Hicklin, and Jackie Ward – feature as backing vocalists, as they do on all successive Partridge Family recordings.

Cash Box said of the song that "attractive sound side and material curries favorable attention from all types of pop programmers."

Four million copies of the single release were sold.

The Partridge Family version of the song is used prominently throughout the 2020 DreamWorks Animation film The Croods: A New Age, with a cover version by Tenacious D being performed during the film's ending credits.

Billy Strange – session leader, arrangement
Hal Blaine – drums, contractor

Andy Williams version 

In 1971 American singer Andy Williams released “Love Story”, an album made up almost entirely of cover versions. His own version of “I Think I Love You” was included on the album. Confusingly, the album was retitled “Home Lovin’ Man” for its UK release, and an entirely different album with the title “Love Story” made an appearance there.

Voice of the Beehive version

In 1991, Anglo-American alternative rock band Voice of the Beehive recorded "I Think I Love You" for their second studio album, Honey Lingers (1991). Issued through London Records, it was released as the second single from the album on September 16, 1991, and was produced by Don Was. Their version of the song peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1991. The single also reached number 12 on the Australian Singles Chart in March 1992.

Stiletto Fetish cover
Stiletto Fetish release a somewhat comedic music video covering the song as a form of sultry rap, with the singers portraying recently escaped mental patients.
