Career
Shepherd's first television acting job was starring as Victoria Carlson in the short lived sitcom Cleghorne!, which aired for one season on The WB in 1995. She told Ebony in 2018, "That was the first job that I booked and I was still a legal secretary. My agent told me, 'You can quit your job.' I had that big break ... and then it was canceled. I lost my apartment, my car was repossessed and I was homeless for a year. I slept on everybody's couch. In this business, it's very uncertain. You can be working one day and not working the next."

Shepherd later became recognized for her role as Sheila Yarborough on Jamie Foxx's own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show from 1996 to 2001 and for recurring roles on the sitcoms Suddenly Susan and Everybody Loves Raymond in the late 1990s, while starring in the show Less Than Perfect in the lead role of Ramona Platt from 2002 to 2006.

Television personality
Shepherd has appeared as a guest host and contestant on several television shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Rachael Ray, and To Tell the Truth. She co-hosted the 35th Daytime Emmy Awards on June 20, 2008. Shepherd also hosted Nickelodeon's NickMom Night Out special from 2013 to 2014, Shepherd hosted Best Ever Trivia Show on Game Show Network for 65 episodes, beginning on June 10, 2019.  She has appeared regularly as a panelist on Funny You Should Ask since 2017.

In 2006, Shepherd became a frequent guest co-host on ABC's daytime talk show The View. She became a permanent co-host in 2007, debuting in September. Since leaving The View in 2014, Shepherd has continued to make several appearances on the show as a contributor throughout 2015 and 2016.

Shepherd was criticized after one 2007 broadcast of The View. The show was often filmed "live", with little or no editing. She stated she did not "believe in evolution. Period." Co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked her, "Is the world flat?" Shepherd responded, "I don't know," and expanded that she "never thought about it". Shepherd later referred to her statement as a "brain fart" brought on by nerves. Barbara Walters and Shepherd talked after that episode: Walters said, "Dear, the Earth is round", and Shepherd responded with: "Barbara, I know that!"

Similar criticism erupted after the December 4, 2007, broadcast of The View when, during a discussion initiated by Joy Behar about Epicurus, Shepherd attempted to assert that Christians existed in classical Greece, and that the Greeks threw them to the lions. When confronted on this point, she further claimed that "Jesus came first" (before Greeks and Romans) and stated, "I don't think anything predated Christians", to which Behar responded: "The Jews."

Shepherd garnered criticism after admitting to never voting partly due to her upbringing as a strict Jehovah's Witness. She was quoted as saying that she just "never knew the dates or anything"; she stated, "I've never voted for anything in my life." In January 2008, Sherri referred to Gospel singer Shirley Caesar as "the black Patti LaBelle." LaBelle, like Caesar, is black.

In 2008, she created controversy on The View due to "flippant" remarks regarding abortion. She later clarified her position, saying her remarks weren't meant to be flippant but rather to inspire other women who may be dealing with guilt after abortions. She cited having multiple abortions in her 20s, suffering from shame and guilt from those experiences, later converting to Christianity. In 2009, Shepherd won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host alongside Behar, Goldberg, Walters, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck.

In March 2012, Shepherd participated as a celebrity contestant on the fourteenth season of ABC's Dancing with the Stars; her dance partner was Val Chmerkovskiy.

In 2019, Shepherd participated in the second season of Fox's The Masked Singer as the "Penguin".

From October 2021 to June 2022, Shepherd was among the recurring guest hosts of the syndicated daytime talk show The Wendy Williams Show, as its namesake Wendy Williams had been on an indefinite absence from the program due to her medical issues. On February 22, 2022, the show's distributor Debmar-Mercury announced that Shepherd had been signed on to host a new talk show, Sherri, which premiered in the 2022–23 television season as a replacement for Wendy. The series premiered on September 12. In January 2023, the series was renewed for its second and third seasons through 2025.

Personal life
Shepherd was married to Jeff Tarpley from 2001 to 2010. They have a son, Jeffrey, born in April 2005. Shepherd became engaged to writer Lamar Sally on December 26, 2010. The couple married in Chicago in August 2011 and separated in May 2014. Following the split, Shepherd and Sally welcomed a son named Lamar Jr. via surrogacy in August 2014; Shepherd does not have a biological connection to the child, as he was conceived using a donor egg. The following year, they finalized their divorce and a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that Shepherd was legally responsible for the child after she challenged the surrogacy contract and sought to remove her name from his birth certificate.

Shepherd has type 2 diabetes after having had pre-diabetes for years. Formerly a Jehovah's Witness, Shepherd is an evangelical Christian.
