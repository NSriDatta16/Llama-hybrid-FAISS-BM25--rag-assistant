Demography

Anchovy beaching incident
On September 29, 2006, millions of anchovies, constituting a weight of over three tons, had beached themselves near Colunga. Tests on the dead fish did not detect any toxic chemical that could have caused the beaching, and the current working theory is that the shoal beached itself trying to escape from "hungry dolphins or tuna." If the beached specimens had grown to maturity, it would have been more than "100 tons of potential breeders."
