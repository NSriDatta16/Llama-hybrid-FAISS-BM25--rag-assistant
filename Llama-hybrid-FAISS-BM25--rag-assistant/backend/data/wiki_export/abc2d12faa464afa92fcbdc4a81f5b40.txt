Location
The neighborhood is bounded by NJ 19 on the west, the border with Clifton, New Jersey to the south, the Passaic River to the east, and I-80 to the north. The Arab community has existed since the late 19th century when many Lebanese and Syrian immigrants moved in. Since then, immigrants from Lebanon have slowed, although many second, third, and fourth-generation residents remain. Recently, Palestinian immigrants have settled in the neighborhood, adding to the mix of Arabs.  In addition to the Arab community, a Turkish community and an Azeri community has existed in the neighborhood since the 1950s made up primarily of Turks and Karachay immigrants.
