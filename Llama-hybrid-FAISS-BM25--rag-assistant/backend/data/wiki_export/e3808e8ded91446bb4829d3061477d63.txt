History
The groundbreaking for the future site of CBHS occurred in early 2001, and construction was finished by late 2002. It is located adjacent to Falcon Cove Middle School.

Cypress Bay opened in 2002 for grades 9–11 with 200 students over its projected capacity. The following 2003–2004 school year it was grades 10-12 that attended the main campus while the 9th grade attended a school annex built at a separate location. This situation continued until 2008 when the 9th grade annex was abolished. A new 36 classroom building was opened in the main campus for the school year 2005−2006 to alleviate overcrowding. The 2006 senior class was the first to have attended the school for all four years and at the same location. This did not occur again until the class of 2012, when the graduation ceremony took place at the freshly completed Marlins Park and Vice President Joe Biden delivered the keynote address. The graduating class of 2007 had 1070 students.

During the 2007−2008 school year, Cypress Bay reached a maximum enrollment of more than 5,500 students and was consequently named the most populous high school in the United States. In response, the school board decided to cap enrollment as a temporary measure to alleviate overcrowding and all new registering students were sent over to Western High School. After the 2008−2009 school year the school boundaries were changed and all students south of Griffin Road were assigned to the new West Broward High School, while students living in Bonaventure were assigned to Western High School.

In 2015, rapper Flo Rida collaborated with then-school principal Charles Neely to create a spin-off rap video based upon his song G.D.F.R (Goin' Down for Real). The video features the principal rapping with several students and staff, and was a congratulatory message to the graduating class.

In early 2019, construction began on a new building at Cypress Bay High School to alleviate the overcrowding issue. Construction continued throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and is estimated to be completed no later than 2022. This building was intended to be three stories, and in the shape of a lightning bolt ("Lightning" is the school's mascot); however, unforeseen issues including a lack of stairwells, hallways, elevators, and bathrooms in the initial construction plan and pricing underestimates may have required that these ideas be altered. The new building was also the source of criticism  by school board members for going over budget $10 million, while other schools received "renovations, repairs and retrofits," despite apparently needing those upgrades more.

Demographics
As of the 2021–22 school year, the total student enrollment was 4,852. The ethnic makeup of the school was 85.8% White, 4.4% Black, 64.2% Hispanic, 6.8% Asian, 2.6% Multiracial, 0.3% Native American or Native Alaskan, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
