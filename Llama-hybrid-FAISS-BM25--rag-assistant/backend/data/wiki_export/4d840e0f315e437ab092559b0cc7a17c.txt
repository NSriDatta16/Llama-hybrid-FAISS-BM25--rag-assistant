Also present are arts and crafts stalls, food and drink outlets, cr√®che and children's entertainment programme, as well as various camping and accommodation options.

Don Clarke, convener of the Legends of the Fen show, and his partner Dicky Roberts, have been managing and hosting the Legends showcase at the festival since 2016. This initiative brought South African icons like Steve Fataar (14 March 1943 - 31 January 2020) back to the festival. In 2019, Don Clarke and P J Powers shared the stage and performed the 1986 hit song, Sanbonani.
