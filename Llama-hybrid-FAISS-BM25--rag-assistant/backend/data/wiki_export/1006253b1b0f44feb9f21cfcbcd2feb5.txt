Sadie Coles HQ is a contemporary art gallery in London,  owned and directed by Sadie Coles. The gallery focuses on presenting the work of established and emerging international artists. It was at the forefront of the Young British Artists movement.

History
Sadie Coles HQ opened in April 1997 and has since operated from a variety of distinctive spaces. Its inaugural exhibition at 35 Heddon Street, by American painter John Currin, was followed by Sarah Lucas’s exhibition ‘The Law’ in lofts on St John Street.

Between 2010 and 2013, Sadie Coles HQ was located at both New Burlington Place – a  space on the site of Nigel Greenwood's gallery during the 1980s and 90s – and on South Audley Street.

In 2013, Sadie Coles HQ moved to its current location, a  first floor gallery on Kingly Street in what was formerly the La Valbonne nightclub. In November 2015, it opened a third location in a glass-fronted  space on Davies Street in Mayfair designed by 6a architects

Since her inaugural exhibition, Coles has followed the same formula for each of her invitations. Taking the graphic identity of the gallery itself – a grey block that represents the gallery space and is found on all her branded material – she uses the same block on the invitations, allowing each artist to choose their own colour. A piece of the artist’s work is then shown on the inside of the card.

In 2014, Sadie Coles was listed as one of 'the most powerful people in the art world' by The Guardian.

From February to December 2012, Situation, a temporary space, showed works by Sarah Lucas. The extended display included works both new and historical, mainly by Lucas and occasionally involving other artists.
