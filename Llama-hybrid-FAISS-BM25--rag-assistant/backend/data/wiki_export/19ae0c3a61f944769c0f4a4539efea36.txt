is a horizontally scrolling shooter published by Irem, and similar in style to their earlier R-Type. In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn. In 2019, the game was released on the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series, marking its first official release outside Japan.

Gameplay
The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. Konami's Xexex is based on a fusion of this weaponry with the Force system of R-Type. In the PlayStation 2 game R-Type Final, the ship "RX-12 Cross The Rubicon" uses the "Flexible Force", a Force based on XMultiply with roughly the same attacks.

Plot
The game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249â€”the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of a person who has been invaded by the alien queen.

Reception 
In Japan, Game Machine listed X Multiply on their November 1, 1989 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade game of the year.
