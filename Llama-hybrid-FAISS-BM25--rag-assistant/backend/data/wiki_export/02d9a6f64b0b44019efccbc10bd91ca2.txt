Teresa Barbara Ciepły (née Wieczorek; 19 October 1937 – 8 March 2006) was a Polish sprinter and hurdler. She was a bronze Olympic medalist in the 4×100 metre relay at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Two years later she won gold medals in the 4 × 100 m relay (in European record time of 44.5 seconds) and the 80 m hurdles, and a bronze medal in the 100 m sprint at the 1962 European Championships. The same year she was chosen as the Polish Sportspersonality of the year. At the 1964 Olympics she won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 m relay, in a world record time of 43.6 seconds, and a silver in the 80 m hurdles. Nationally Ciepły won the Polish titles in the 80 m hurdles (1961–62, 1964–1965) and in the 100 m sprint (1960–1962).

Shortly after the 1960 Olympics she married Olgierd Ciepły, an Olympic hammer thrower. In retirement Ciepły worked as a clerk and an athletics coach in Bydgoszcz. After her death, a secondary school there was named in her honor.
