Albert Lacroix () was a 19th-century Belgian publisher and printer who risked launching some seminal authors like the Goncourt brothers and Émile Zola. In 1869 he published Les Chants de Maldoror by Comte de Lautréamont. However, fearing prosecution for blasphemy and obscenity, he ultimately refused to sell the book. In 1862, he was the original publisher of Les Misérables under the name Librairie internationale A. Lacroix, Verboeckhoven, et Cie.
