Burnpur is a captive township of SAIL, the area covered by IISCO Steel Plant and its surroundings in Asansol of Paschim Bardhaman district, in the heart of the mining-industrial belt in the western periphery of the state of West Bengal, India. It is governed by Asansol Municipal Corporation.

History
In the early British era, Hirapur finds a place in the list of villages under Asansol police station and served by Asansol post office, in the village directory of Burdwan district compiled by the Post Master General of Bengal in 1884. The Bengal Nagpur Railway main line from Nagpur to Asansol, on the Howrah-Delhi main line, was opened for goods traffic on 1 February 1891. A railway station, named Narsinghbandh came up on that line, near Hirapur.

The Indian Iron and Steel Company was incorporated on 11 March 1918. The iron works of IISCO was to be located at Hirapur and was subsequently named Hirapur Works. As the construction of the plant commenced, there was brisk activity at Hirapur and the adjoining jungle villages of Santa, Narsinghbandh, Napuria and Dharampur. As Burn & Company played an important role in the setting up of the entire project, the upcoming township was christened Burnpur. The name of the railway station, Narsinghbandh, was subsequently changed to Burnpur.

The Steel Corporation of Bengal was incorporated on 20 April 1937 with Burn & Co. as managing agents. SCOB established steel making facilities at Napuria, adjacent to the Hirapur Works of IISCO and the plant was named Napuria Works. In 1953, SCOB was amalgamated with IISCO. Napuria Works producing steel coalesced with Hirapur Works producing iron to form Burnpur Works of IISCO. IISCO went in for major extensions in the fifties. A new township at Chhotodighari was ready for occupation by 1959. Along with the development of the company’s township, several areas such as Subashpally, Santinagar, Puranahat, Rahmatnagar and Rambandh developed over the years filling up the space between the old villages of Hirapur and Narsinghbandh.

The Indian Standard Wagon Company, founded in 1918, shared the facilities in the company’s township at Burnpur. In 1976, Burn & Co. was amalgamated with the Indian Standard Wagon Company and renamed Burn Standard Company. On 4 April 2018, the Government of India approved the liquidation of Burn Standard Company.
