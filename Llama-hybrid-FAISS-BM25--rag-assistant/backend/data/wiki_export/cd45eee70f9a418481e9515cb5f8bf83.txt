Harry Whittington (February 4, 1915 – June 11, 1989) was an American mystery novelist and one of the pioneers of the paperback novel.  Born in Ocala, Florida, he worked in government jobs before becoming a writer.

His reputation as a prolific writer of pulp fiction novels is supported by his writing of 85 novels in a span of twelve years (as many as seven in a single month) mostly in the crime, suspense, hardboiled, and noir fiction genres.  In total, he published over 200 novels. Seven of his writings were produced for the screen, including the television series Lawman (1958-1962). His reputation as 'The King of the Pulps' is shared with author H. Bedford-Jones. Eight of Whittington's hardboiled noir novels were republished by Stark House Press.
