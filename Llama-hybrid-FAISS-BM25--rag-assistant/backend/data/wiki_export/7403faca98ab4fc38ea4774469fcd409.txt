The transverse cervical nerve (superficial cervical or cutaneous cervical) is a cutaneous (sensory) nerve of the cervical plexus that arises from the second and third cervical spinal nerves (C2-C3). It curves around the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoideus muscle, then pierces the fascia of the neck before dividing into two branches. It provides sensory innervation to the front of the neck.

Anatomy

Course and relations 
It curves around the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoideus muscle about its middle, and, passing obliquely forward beneath the external jugular vein to the anterior border of the muscle, it perforates the deep cervical fascia before dividing into an ascending branch and a descending branch beneath the platysma. The ascending branch communicates with the cervical branch of the facial nerve.

Dissection 
During dissection, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is the landmark, with the transverse cervical nerve passing horizontally over this muscle from Erb's point.

Distribution 
The nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the anterior neck between the chin and the sternum.
