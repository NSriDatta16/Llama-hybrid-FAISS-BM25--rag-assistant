Karymsky (, Karymskaya sopka) is an active stratovolcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. It and Shiveluch are Kamchatka's largest, most active and most continuously erupting volcanoes, as well as one of the most active on the planet.

It is named after the Karyms, an ethnic group in Russia.

Description
Karymsky is a symmetrical stratovolcano rising within a 5-km-wide caldera that formed during the early Holocene. Much of the cone is mantled by lava flows less than 200Â years old. Historical eruptions have been vulcanian or vulcanian-strombolian with moderate explosive activity and occasional lava flows from the summit crater. There is currently an ongoing cycle of non-stop eruption occurring, and is the peninsula's most active, and reliable volcano, which has been erupting continuously since 1996.
