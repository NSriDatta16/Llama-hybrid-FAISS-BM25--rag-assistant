Centro also formerly known as Central is an Indian department store chain operated by Reliance Group. Reliance Retail (RRL) has changed Future Groupâ€™s Central department store model into Centro in areas where RRL took over the lease after Future Group lapsed on rentals and relinquished the property. On 9th May 2023, the first Centro opened in Vasant Kunj, Delhi. It competes with other department store chains such as Shoppers Stop, Pantaloons and Westside.

Outlets
Central opened its first store in Bangalore in 2004.

In January 2018, Central operated over 30 outlets in cities in India and planned to add more stores in future. New and existing stores are being upgraded to what it calls "HD format" with more premium brands and a better shopping experience.
