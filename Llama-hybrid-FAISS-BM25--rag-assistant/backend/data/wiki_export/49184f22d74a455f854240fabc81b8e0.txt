In mathematics, a complex Hadamard matrix H of size N with all its columns (rows) mutually orthogonal,  belongs  to the Butson-type H(q, N) if all its elements are powers of q-th root of unity,

Existence 

If p is prime and , then  can exist
only for  with integer m and
it is conjectured they exist for all such cases 
with . For , the corresponding conjecture is existence for all multiples of 4.
In general, the problem of finding all sets
 such that the Butson - type matrices
 exist, remains open.

Examples 
 contains real Hadamard matrices of size N,
 contains Hadamard matrices composed of   - such matrices were called by Turyn, complex Hadamard matrices.
 in the limit  one can approximate all complex Hadamard matrices.
Fourier matrices 
belong to the Butson-type,
