The Catholic Church in Angola is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.

Catholicism was introduced to Angola by the Portuguese in 1491 when the first missionaries arrived. 

Many of the missionaries saw themselves as Portuguese, rather than integrating into Angolan society. Non-Portuguese missionaries were required to renounce the laws of their own country and submit to Portuguese law, as well as prove their ability to speak and write the Portuguese language. The Colonial Act of 1930 advanced the view that Portuguese Catholic missions to the country were "instruments of civilization and national influence".

Demographics

The last census in 2014 noted that 56.4% of the population were Roman Catholic. 

As of 2020, approximately 53.85% of the population professed the Catholic faith, due largely to Angola's status as a former Portuguese colony.
