Films in the Philippines derive income mainly from theatrical exhibitions as revenues from home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising share a small portion of the studio earnings. Even more, unlike in the United States and other territories, gross receipts of movies in the country were not officially disclosed in detail through the years. Third-party organizations that focus on box-office statistics were not present in the industry until the website Box Office Mojo started providing comprehensive weekly performance of releases in 2007. Although the website is a reliable source, it does not summarize the highest grosses of all time for the reason that its scope is limited to the Metro Manila Film Festival, an annual event during December to January.
