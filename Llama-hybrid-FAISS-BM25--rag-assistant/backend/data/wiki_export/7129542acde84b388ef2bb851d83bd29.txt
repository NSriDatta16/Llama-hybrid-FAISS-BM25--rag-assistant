History

Century was launched in 1995 and went into a five-week drydock in April 2006 for refurbishment. Designed to incorporate a variety of Celebrity's Millennium-class attributes, the revitalization of Century was the line's most extensive refurbishment to-date, and the largest cruise ship modification completed by Fincantieri's Palermo, Italy, shipyard.

In late December 2013, it was rumored that the ship would transfer to CDF Croisi√®res de France in 2015. Celebrity Cruises continued to deny the rumors until 13 February 2014 when they formally announced her departure from the fleet in April 2015, from March 2014 through April 2015, Celebrity Century visited 77 ports in 32 countries, the most destinations of any ship in the Celebrity fleet. The line celebrated this final season with several special events, including a 14-night President's Cruise to Asia with Celebrity President and CEO Michael Bayley. On 2 September 2014, it was announced that SkySea Cruises, a joint venture between Ctrip and Royal Caribbean, would acquire the vessel and begin operations after April 2015.
