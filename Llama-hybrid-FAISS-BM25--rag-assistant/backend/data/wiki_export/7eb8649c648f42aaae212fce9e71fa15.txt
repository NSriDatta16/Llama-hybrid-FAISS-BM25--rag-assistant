The 29th World Cup season began in November 1994 in Park City, USA (December 1994 in Tignes, France for men), and concluded in March 1995 at the World Cup finals in Bormio, Italy.  The overall champions were Alberto Tomba of Italy (his first) and Vreni Schneider of Switzerland (her third).

A break in the schedule was for the 1995 World Championships at Sierra Nevada in southern Spain.  However, due to the lack of snow, these championships were postponed until 1996.
