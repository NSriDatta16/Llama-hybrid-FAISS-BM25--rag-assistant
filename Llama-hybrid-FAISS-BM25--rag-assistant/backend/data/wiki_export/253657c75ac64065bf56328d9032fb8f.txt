"Who Am I? (What's My Name?)" (commonly titled "What's My Name?") is the debut solo single by American rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, released on November 11, 1993, as the debut single from his first album, Doggystyle (1993), with the record labels Death Row and Interscope Records. The song, produced by Dr. Dre, features samples and interpolations from George Clinton's "Atomic Dog" in its chorus and throughout, the bass line from Funkadelic's (Not Just) Knee Deep and an interpolation from Parliament's "Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof off the Sucker)" in its bridge. The song's intro contains a sample from The Counts' "Pack of Lies." A vocal sample ("the bomb") from Parliament's "P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up)" can be heard throughout.

The song and music video were parodied in director Rusty Cundieff's film, Fear of a Black Hat (1993). In the UK in 2014, the song was used on an advert for MoneySupermarket, which featured Snoop Dogg. It was ranked number 456 on NMEs "500 Greatest Songs of All Time".

Critical reception
Alan Jones from Music Week gave the song four out of five, naming it Pick of the Week. He wrote, "Clearly influenced by George Clinton, Cameo and the like, this laidback rap cut has been widely praised with the industry has a gimmick warcry, some soulful femmes and stands every chance of being a hit." NME named it What's My Muthaf—in' Single of the Week, saying, "In time and tune with the '70s revival, Dre has hit a seam of incendiary funk and it just don't stop — coupled with Snoop's irresistible style they've got a Jurassic-size monster of a hit on their hands." The reviewer also praised it as "a straight-up party record, fit for any and every occasion, with more hooks than 20 rounds of Eubank v Benn. This is gonna be HUGE." Ralph Tee from the RM Dance Update complimented "its infectious "Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yeah" hook and a production steeped in the tradition of Seventies George Clinton and Cameo". He stated that "it's Snoop's rhymes and the aforementioned hook that's making this a smash". Charles Aaron from Spin commented, "There's a big diff between asking "Who Am I?" and being prepared for conflicting answers from your audience, and asking "What's My Name?" and having yet another fucking George Clinton sample reinforce your ego."

Commercial performance 
"Who Am I? (What's My Name?)" was the first top 10 hit of Snoop Dogg on the  Billboard Hot 100, the first as a lead rap artist. The song reached number eight on the chart. The song topped the US Hot Rap Songs for three weeks. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1994.

Music video
Fab Five Freddy directs a CGI-driven music video for the song. Snoop and others (Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, and Warren G) are able to transform into dogs (such as Dobermann Pinschers, Rottweilers, Pit bulls, and Cocker Spaniels and several other breeds) to evade upsetting fathers and run wild, while also evading a pair of clumsy dog catchers while in these forms. One scene shows the dogs wearing sunglasses, smoking cigars and gambling on dice games (an homage to the late 19th century/early 20th century series of paintings by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge titled Dogs Playing Poker). Throughout the video Snoop can be seen standing on the roof of V.I.P. Records, a record store and studio where Snoop Dogg recorded some of his first material. Snoop's girlfriend in the video was played by now-clinical nurse liaison Athena Germany, who later appeared in Family Feud with rest of her family in 2021.

Live performances
Snoop performed the song live on The Arsenio Hall Show on December 17, 1993 and on Soul Train on December 18, 1993. He also performed the song live at the 1994 Soul Train Music Awards on March 15, 1994.
