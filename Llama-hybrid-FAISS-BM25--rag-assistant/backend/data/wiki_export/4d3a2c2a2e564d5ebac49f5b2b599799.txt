Nepenthes platychila (; from Greek for "flat-lipped") is a tropical pitcher plant endemic to the Hose Mountains of central Sarawak. It is notable for its smooth peristome and funnel-shaped upper pitchers. Nepenthes platychila belongs to the loosely defined "N. maxima complex", which also includes, among other species, N. boschiana, N. chaniana, N. epiphytica, N. eymae, N. faizaliana, N. fusca, N. klossii, N. maxima, N. stenophylla, and N. vogelii.

Nepenthes platychila was included in a 2002 report on the Nepenthes of the Hose Mountains under the placeholder name Nepenthes sp. 'B'.
