History

St. Nicholas Monastery

The settlement has grown around the Ugresha Monastery which stands at the heart of the modern town. The monastery has been one of the richest in Russia since the 17th century when Tsar Alexis and Patriarch Nikon built their palaces on the grounds. It was greatly expanded in the 19th century, under the supervision of St. Pimen of Ugreshi. One of the new churches in the monastery is dedicated to St. Pimen. The walled area of the monastery has several picturesque ponds.

Modern history
After the October Revolution of 1917, in an effort to fight child homelessness, the monastery was reorganized into a children labor colony in 1920. The colony was later transformed into a labor commune by Felix Dzerzhinsky. In 1921, the colony spread outside the boundaries of the former monastery and an official settlement was established. In 1938, it was granted urban-type settlement status, just after the commune had dissolved. Town status was granted to Dzerzhinsky in 1981.

On March 31, 2006, Viktor Dorkin, the head of the Local Government Board, was shot and killed. Investigation stated that he was assassinated because of his professional career. One killer was detained before May 5, 2006.
