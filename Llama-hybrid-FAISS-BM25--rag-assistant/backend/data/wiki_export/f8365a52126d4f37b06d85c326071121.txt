Ben O'Connor (born 25 January 1979) is an Irish hurling coach and former player. He is the current coach of the Charleville intermediate team. O'Connor played for Cork Senior Championship club Newtownshandrum and was a member of the Cork senior hurling team for 14 seasons, during which time he usually lined out as a right wing-forward. Noted for his commanding presence and scoring ability on the wing, he is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation.

O'Connor began his hurling career at club level with Newtownshandrum. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 17-year-old in 1996 and enjoyed his first success that year when the club won the Cork Intermediate Championship title and promotion to the top flight of Cork hurling. O'Connor went on to make 79 championship appearances at senior level and was at centre-forward on Newtownshandrum's All-Ireland Club Championship-winning team in 2004. His club career ended in 2012, by which time he had also won three Munster Club Championship titles and four Cork Senior Championship titles.

At inter-county level, O'Connor was part of the successful Cork under-21 team that won the All-Ireland Championship in 1998. He joined the Cork senior team in 1999. From his debut, O'Connor was ever-present as a forward and made a combined total of 114 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 2012. During that time he was joined on the team by his twin brother Jerry and was part of three All-Ireland Championship-winning teams – in 1999, as captain of the team in 2004 and 2005. O'Connor also secured five Munster Championship medals. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 15 March 2012.

O'Connor won his first All-Star in 2005, before claiming a further All-Star in 2008. He is currently Cork's fourth-highest championship scorer of all time, having scored 8–230 in 62 appearances. At inter-provincial level, O'Connor was selected to play in four championship campaigns with Munster, with his sole Railway Cup medal being won in 2005.

Senior

O'Connor had just turned 20 when he was added to the Cork senior hurling panel. He lined out in three games during the team's unsuccessful bid to retain the National Hurling League title in 1999. On 13 June 1999, O'Connor made his first championship appearance at right corner-forward and scored a point in Cork's 0–24 to 1–15 defeat of Waterford. He started at left corner-forward in the subsequent Munster Championship final on 5 July and scored two points in the 1–15 to 0–14 defeat of reigning champions Clare. On 11 September, O'Connor was again at left corner-forward for the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny which Cork won by 0–12 to 0–11. He was later nominated for an All-Star award.

On 3 July 2000, O'Connor lined out in his second Munster Championship final. He scored three points from left corner-forward in the 0–23 to 3–12 defeat of Tipperary.

O'Connor was appointed captain of the Cork senior team for the 2001 season.

On 5 May 2002, O'Connor scored two points in Cork's 2–15 to 2–14 defeat by Kilkenny in the National League final. On 29 November, O'Connor and his 29 teammates from the Cork senior team announced that they were withdrawing their services from the county in the hope of better treatment from the county board. He had a low-key role during the two-week debacle which ended with a settlement with the Cork County Board on 13 December.

O'Connor lined out in his third Munster final on 29 June 2003. As right wing-forward he scored four points in Cork's 3–16 to 3–12 defeat of Waterford. On 14 September, O'Connor was again at right wing-forward for Cork's 1–14 to 1-11 All-Ireland final defeat by Kilkenny. He ended the season by being nominated for a second All-Star award.

O'Connor was appointed captain of the Cork senior team for the 2004 season. On 27 June, he lost his first Munster Championship final when Waterford defeated Cork by 3–16 to 1-21. In spite of this defeat, Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. A 0–17 to 0–09 victory gave O'Connor a second All-Ireland medal as well as the honour of accepting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. He ended the season by being nominated for a third All-Star award.

O'Connor won his fourth Munster Championship medal on 26 June 2005 after a 1–21 to 1–16 defeat of Tipperary in the final at Páirc Uí Chaoimh. On 11 September 2005, Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final for the first time since 1990. O'Connor was in his usual position of right wing-forward and scored 1–07 in a man of the match display. Cork won the game by 1–21 to 1–16, with O'Connor collecting a third All-Ireland medal. He ended the season by winning his first All-Star award.

On 25 June 2006, O'Connor won his fifth Munster Championship medal when he scored 1–01 in a 2–14 to 1–14 defeat of Tipperary for the second consecutive year. Cork subsequently qualified for a fourth successive All-Ireland final, with Kilkenny providing the opposition for the third time.  O'Connor top scored for Cork with 1-04, however, Cork eventually lost the game by 1–16 to 1–13. He ended the season by being nominated for a fifth All-Star.

Following the 2006 All-Ireland final defeat Cork hurling went into decline.  An All-Ireland quarter-final defeat in 2007 was followed by a second players' strike at the end of the year. This was in sympathy with the Cork senior football team. A second strike followed at the end of 2008 over the re-appointment of Gerald McCarthy as manager of the senior hurling team. All of these factors resulted in Cork's hurling team going into further decline.

In 2010 O'Connor's side looked to be moving in the right direction. Cork qualified for the final of the National League; however, victory went to Galway. The team later reached the Munster final, only to lose out to Waterford after a replay.

2011 also saw Cork enjoy little success in the championship as the team exited following a defeat by Galway in the qualifiers. Following this defeat there was speculation that O'Connor may retire from the inter-county scene. While his twin brother Jerry decided to hang up his hurley, O'Connor decided to return to training for another season. He lined out in both of Cork's opening National League games in 2012; however, in a shock announcement he decided to call time on his career in March 2012.

Munster

O'Connor has also played with Munster in the inter-provincial championship. He first lined out for his province in 2002; however, defeat was his lot. A similar fate befell the province again in 2003. In 2005 O'Connor secured his first, and only, Railway Cup winners' medal. He was a member of the team again in 2008; however, Munster lost out on that occasion again.

Management career

Charleville

O'Connor's first major position as a coach was with the Charleville intermediate hurling team. On 29 October 2018 he coached the team to a first ever Premier Intermediate Championship title after a 0–15 to 0–14 defeat of Courcey Rovers in a final replay. They would later add the Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship overcoming Kilmaley. They lost out in the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Hurling Championship to Oranmore-Maree in Croke Park in 2019.

Midleton

On 23 December 2019, it was confirmed that O'Connor had been appointed manager of the Midleton senior hurling team for the 2020 Championship.

Personal life
O'Connor was born in the village of Newtownshandrum, County Cork to Bernie and Kathleen O'Connor (née O'Mahony). He was educated at the local national school before later attending Mannix College in Charleville. While going to school here he had his first national hurling success, when he won an All-Ireland vocational schools medal in 1997.

O'Connor currently works with his father as a hurley maker in Newtownshandrum village.
