The Murutic languages are a family of half a dozen closely related Austronesian languages, spoken in the northern inland regions of Borneo by the Murut and Tidung.

Languages
The Murutic languages are (Lobel 2013):

Innovations
Lobel (2013:367) lists the following Murutic phonological innovations. (Note: PSWSAB stands for Proto-Southwest Sabahan, while PMP stands for Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.)
PMP/PSWSAB *R > *h / __ V (except after *ə, where it had already shifted to *g in PSWSAB). Subsequently, Proto-Greater Murutic *h > Ø occurred in all daughter languages except Papar.
PMP/PSWSAB *R > *g / __ #
PMP/PSWSAB *aw > *ow; *ay > *oy
PMP/PSWSAB *iw > *uy
PGMUR *g- > Ø after the adjectival prefix *ma-
PMP/PSWSAB *ə > *a in non-final syllables, except in the environment *_Cə, where it is reflected as /o/
