In June 2013, the stadium was the reason FC Stal Alchevsk refused its promotion to the Ukrainian Premier League. Because at the time did not meet the requirements of the highest Ukrainian division and the club did not want to play in another stadium because it saw "no point in holding matches in another stadium as most fans of Stal wonâ€™t see them".
