Indiana State Road 237 in the U.S. state of Indiana is a discontinuous route in Perry and Crawford counties.

Route description

Southern section 
The Perry County segment of SR 237, which connects to SR 37 about  northeast of Tell City, Indiana, provides access to Hawesville, Kentucky, via the Bob Cummings - Lincoln Trail Bridge in Cannelton, where it continues southward as Kentucky Route 69. This segment of SR 237 is  in length and replaced an older, winding and narrow segment in 2004.

Northern section 
The Crawford County segment was created on November 21, 2007, when an  segment of SR 37 from Interstate 64 at Sulphur to SR 64 at English was renumbered as SR 237. The redesignation is due to SR 37's designation being transferred to a new route (the Frank O'Bannon Highway) from I-64 to SR 64 and SR 145 between St. Croix and Eckerty.

Future 
In addition, a proposed highway by-pass of Paoli, the seat of Orange County, may carry the SR 237 designation as well.  This project is still in the planning stages and construction has yet to be scheduled.
