Critical reception
The Guardian wrote that "the 'serious rock' influences paraded, Led Zep through a Level 42 filter, eventually pale and subside under the weight of an over ambitious musician stretching for something defining." The Vancouver Sun concluded that "mostly it sounds like a '90s version of Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies, without the lengthy solos." The Sun-Herald determined that "the arrangements are spot on but Jones could do with a few stronger tunes and a little less instrumental free-forming."
