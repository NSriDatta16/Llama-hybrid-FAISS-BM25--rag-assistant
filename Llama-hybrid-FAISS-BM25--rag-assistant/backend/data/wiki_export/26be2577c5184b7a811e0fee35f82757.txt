"Look on the Floor" is a song by English girl group Bananarama, released in November 2005 as the second single from their ninth album Drama. The song was written by Sara Dallin, Keren Woodward, H. Korpi, M. Wollo, M. Malavasi and S. Micheli, and was produced by Korpi and BlackCell. Contained in "Look on the Floor" is an interpolation of the chorus of the 1983 Italo disco song "Hypnotic Tango" by My Mine.

"Look on the Floor" peaked at number 26 in the United Kingdom, where it became their twenty-fifth – and, to date, final – top 40 single. Later in the year it was released internationally and peaked at number twelve on the Spanish singles chart.

Although the single was not released in the United States, it peaked at number two on the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart strictly based on nightclub play of the import single (a rare occurrence for the U.S. dance chart), becoming Bananarama's biggest club hit since "Venus" in 1986. "Look on the Floor" soon caught on to radio, peaking at number five on the Hot Dance Airplay chart. The dance chart success of this single prompted an official release in the United States of Bananarama's previous single "Move in My Direction" in August 2006.

The Angel City remix of the song was included on the soundtrack to You Don't Mess with the Zohan.
