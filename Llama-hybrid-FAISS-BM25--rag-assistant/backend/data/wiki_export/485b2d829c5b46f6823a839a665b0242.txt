Mixed martial arts career

Ultimate Fighting Championship
Gurgel starred in the second season of The Ultimate Fighter television series and was eliminated from the show in the fifth episode due to a loss to Jason Von Flue via unanimous decision, but showed tremendous heart by fighting with a blown ACL.

Gurgel's match with Diego Saraiva at UFC 73 was designated as the "Fight of the Night" by the UFC. In the contest, Gurgel defeated Saraiva by unanimous decision, even though he was badly injured during the fight. He was hospitalized afterward, due to a broken jaw and the presence of blood in his urine.

After his loss to Aaron Riley, Gurgel was released from the UFC. Gurgel was heavily criticized throughout his seven-fight run in the UFC for not displaying Brazilian jiu-jitsu skills in his fights. A third degree Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt, the 35-year-old has generally elected to slug it out on his feet.
