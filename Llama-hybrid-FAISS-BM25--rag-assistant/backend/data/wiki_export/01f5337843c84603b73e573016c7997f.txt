"Stop Whispering" is a song by the English alternative rock band Radiohead, included on their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). It was released as a single in the US in October 1993. Radiohead rerecorded it for the single release, as they were unsatisfied with the album version.

Recording
Radiohead recorded various demos of "Stop Whispering" while they were an unsigned band in Abingdgon, Oxfordshire. One version impressed the owner of another local studio, Chris Hufford, who became Radiohead's co-manager with his partner, Bryce Edge. 

Radiohead recorded "Stop Whispering" for their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). According to the co-producer, Paul Kolderie, "We tinkered with it a bit. It was kind of a sprawling thing and we weren't sure how long it would be." Radiohead re-recorded "Stop Whispering" for the US single, as they were not happy with the album version. The guitarist Ed O'Brien said the new version was more atmospheric, likening it to Joy Division.

In Australia, it was released as the follow-up to Radiohead's debut single, "Creep", on 7 February 1994, reaching #131 on the Australian ARIA singles chart.
