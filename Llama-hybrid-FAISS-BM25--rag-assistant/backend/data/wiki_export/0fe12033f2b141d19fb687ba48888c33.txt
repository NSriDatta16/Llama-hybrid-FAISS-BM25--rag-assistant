Churchfield Road, Acton, runs north of and parallel to Acton High Street. At the eastern end is the level crossing of Acton Central railway station after which it becomes East Churchfield Road. The western end forms a junction of which the northern road is Horn Lane, the southern Market Place and the western, the now pedestrianised King Street. St. Mary's Burial Ground lies on the southern side of the centre section of the road.

It has its own community association formed in 2001.

Retail
Churchfield road can be divided into two retail sections, the eastern end nearest the station and the western end nearest the mount that merges into the main shopping area. In recent years there has been a slight decline in the number of shops in the road with many of those closed remaining empty. The Sub-Post office at number 24 closed in 2010, after many years. Churchfiled Road has recently seen growth in independent retailers and other business practices such as estate agents, restaurants and cafes. Two new additions are Forbes Waterhouse, Bake Me and Sainsbury.
