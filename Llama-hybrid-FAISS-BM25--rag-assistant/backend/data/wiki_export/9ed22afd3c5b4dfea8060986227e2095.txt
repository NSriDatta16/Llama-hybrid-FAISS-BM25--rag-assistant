The 1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series was the 45th season of professional stock car racing in the United States and the 22nd modern-era Cup season. The season began on February 7 and ended on November 14. Dale Earnhardt of Richard Childress Racing won the title, the sixth of his career.

1993 was marked by the deaths of two Winston Cup drivers, though neither were on-track in any form.  1992 Champion Alan Kulwicki was killed on April 1 in a plane crash near Blountville, Tennessee.  He was travelling to Bristol International Raceway in a corporate jet belonging to his sponsor, Hooters. Davey Allison died on July 13, a day after a helicopter crash at Talladega Superspeedway left him with a severe head trauma. The accidents robbed the sport two of its brightest young stars and denied Kulwicki the chance to defend his 1992 title.

The season also saw the introduction of electronic scoring, giving instantaneous interval numbers.

This was the first season without NASCAR legend Richard Petty since 1957.

The race was marked by two major accidents: Stanley Smith suffered near-fatal head injuries in a lap 69 accident while Jimmy Horton flew over the wall in-between turns 1 and 2 and landed on an access road outside the track in the same crash.

 This was the last race with an entry list of less than 40 cars until the 2016 Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500, where only 39 cars entered. NASCAR limited race fields to a maximum of 40 cars starting with the 2016 season.

This would be the first race in NASCAR history that 2 sets of 3 brothers all competed against each other: The Wallace's (Rusty, Mike, & Kenny), and The Bodine's (Geoff, Brett, & Todd). The eldest brother of each set (Rusty & Geoff) finished ahead of the younger brothers. The Wallace's finished 4th (Rusty), 30th (Mike), &  35th (Kenny). The Bodine's finished 13th (Geoff), 15th (Brett), & 42nd/Last (Todd). All drivers but Todd saw the checkered flag and finished the race. Rusty was the only one to finish on the lead lap.
This was Rick Wilson's 200th career start. He would finish 32 laps down to the winner in 36th.

Dale Earnhardt won his sixth Winston Cup championship, needing only to finish in 34th place or better to score enough points to clinch the title; he finished 10th. On lap 117, enough cars had dropped out of the race to mathematically clinch the championship for Earnhardt. Rusty Wallace (the 1989 champion) gave the maximum effort in his 300th career Winston Cup start. Wallace led the most laps and won the race, his tenth win of the 1993 season. But it was not enough as he fell 80 points shy of Earnhardt, and wound up second in the championship to Earnhardt. 

Rusty Wallace became the first driver since Dale Earnhardt in 1987 to win ten or more Cup Series races in a single season. This would be the second time in Bob Latford's 1975 Winston Cup points system history, however, that a driver winning ten or more races in a season failed to win the championship.

This was Wallace's 31st and final victory driving a Pontiac, as he and Penske South Racing would switch to Ford in 1994. Pontiac left NASCAR at the end of 2003, and GM discontinued the Pontiac division in 2010. Wallace holds the NASCAR record for most wins by a Pontiac driver (the first 31 of his 55 career wins).

 During practice, Dale Earnhardt, Ken Schrader, and Jeff Gordon all had crashes. However, all three were uninjured and qualified for the race.

 This race was a day of remembrance, as mentioned in the television broadcast opening. Exactly a one-year prior, the 1992 race ended up being one of the greatest races of all time - and two of the key fixtures Alan Kulwicki and Davey Allison were killed in aviation accidents during the season.

 Neil Bonnett qualified for the race in a backup car (#31) for RCR, and executed one of the first start and park situations in NASCAR. The team arranged that Bonnett would climb out of the #31 car, at the last minute, in the event that Earnhardt's primary #3 car, after pre-race inspection, suffered mechanical failure on the grid or during the pace laps. If Earnhardt quickly hopped in and took the green flag to start the race in the #31 car, by rule, he would be awarded full points for that entry. The car Bonnett qualified was even prepared with Earnhardt's exact chassis set-ups. Earnhardt started his primary car (#3) without incident, and Bonnett pulled off the track to finish last after 3 laps. The team gave the reason of "engine failure". Bonnett's intentional "start and park" also helped maximize Earnhardt's finishing position, as only seven additional cars had to drop out for Earnhardt to mathematically clinch the title. RCR pulled out all the stops in preparation for this race. They brought a truck filled with extra spare parts, including an entire pre-assembled rear end and a framing machine to fix the car in case of a crash. This was also Bonnett's final ever NASCAR race he competed in before his death at Daytona in February 1994.

 Due to fog at the airport, several pit crew members on several teams were late arriving at the track. Darrell Waltrip started the race without his entire pit crew.

 Jeff Gordon secured the rookie of the year award, but in a mild surprise, he did not manage to win a points-paying race during the season nor did he finish in the top-ten in points.

 Todd Bodine, the contracted driver of car 75, was injured in the previous day's Busch Grand National race, so he was replaced for the race by Phil Parsons.

Rookie of the Year 
After his contract was bought from Bill Davis Racing, Jeff Gordon drove the #24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevy in 1993. He won one pole, had eleven top-tens and finished 14th in points. His next closest competitor was Bobby Labonte who had replaced Gordon at BDR. He had six top-tens and one pole, while third-place finisher Kenny Wallace had only three top-tens. The last place runner was P. J. Jones, who declared late in the season and only ran six races for Melling Racing.
