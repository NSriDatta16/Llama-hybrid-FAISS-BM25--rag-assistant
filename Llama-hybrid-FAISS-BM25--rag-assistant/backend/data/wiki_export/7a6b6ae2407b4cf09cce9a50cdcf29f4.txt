Overview

The show premiered on August 2, 2000. It began with very casual crime scene reports, which continues to be the usual focus. Various crimes were featured, including kidnapping, slavery, child abuse, and various drug-related crimes. The team was equipped with hidden cameras for doing entrapment operations with the help of the Philippine National Police, the Department of Social Welfare and Development, the Optical Media Board, the Bureau of Customs, the Bureau of Immigration, the Commission on Human Rights, the National Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.

From crime reports, the show expanded into an all-around investigative show. It features societal problems such as corruption, problems in local governments, illegal activities, poverty, disloyalty, cleanliness, education, wasted public funds, the youth and public health and safety. The show started dramatizations on January 19, 2014.

The show was presented by different GMA Integrated News reporters such as Emil Sumangil and John Consulta during Enriquez's medical leave from 2022 until his death on August 29, 2023, at the age of 71. On September 2, 2023, a tribute episode dedicated to Enriquez was aired, with Arnold Clavio serving as the narrator.
