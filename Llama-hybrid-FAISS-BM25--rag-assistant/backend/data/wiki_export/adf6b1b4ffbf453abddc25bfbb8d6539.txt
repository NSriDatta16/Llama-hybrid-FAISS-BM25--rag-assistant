Larry Parnes, Billy Fury's manager, co-wrote the original story and co-produced, while Kenneth Hume directed, co-produced and co-wrote the story, with musical direction by Mike Leander. This 1965 U.K. release was filmed on location in Techniscope at Great Yarmouth where Fury had just finished his summer season at the Royal Aquarium Theatre which was used as the theatre in the film, with shooting also taking place at Shepperton Studios.

Plot 
Based on the star's famous love of animals, this musical comedy portrays Billy setting out to add a sheepdog to his vast entourage of animals and coming back with an irresistible horse named Armitage instead.  To his manager's horror, Billy smuggles the horse backstage during rehearsals for his big show and the horse proceeds to create havoc.  Little do either of them know that Armitage is actually a thoroughbred racehorse.  Then Billy's horse contracts pneumonia and Billy must choose between love of his horse and the big show.
