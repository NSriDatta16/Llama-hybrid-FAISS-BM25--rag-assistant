Places and monuments

Lambersart has been an expensive residential city since the beginning of the 2000s when many regional businessmen moved to the city.  The area in Deûle and the surrounding countryside has been a popular area. Urbanization as a result of increased population as a Lille suburb has resulted in the loss of open land.  The architecture style which has been conserved include features such as the Touquet and Malo baths.  As in common in the Nord/Pas-de-Calais Area, the red brick style is frequently found.  The "Avenue de l'Hippodrome" is an avenue considered on a local scale to be the world's most beautiful avenue, with many regionalist villas for wealthy industrialists built in the early 20th century; among them is the Villa Saint-Charles by architect Victor Mollet.  In Lambersart, even the small streets are often named "Avenues".

There is a transmission tower in Lambersart, less powerful than that of Bondues, which allows the inhabitants of the urban Community of Lille and some peripheral zones to receive TNT  (television numerique terrestre) since 31 March 2005. (At the end of 2006, 63% of the French population can receive the TNT, with more than 4 million having adapters. In northern France, only one quarter of the population receives it because of the obstruction of the radio relay system and of the international disagreements in this area).  The architecture of the municipal police station is the pride of local lambersartois people.

Transportation
Served by line 2 of the Lille Metro, it takes less than twenty minutes from metro station Lomme-Lambersart to Lille Flandres central station thanks to the many metro stations along the Avenue de Dunkerque, the city is also close to the St. Philibert metro station which is located between the hospital and shopping centre. Four bus lines serve Lambersart to central Lille.

The city is close to the A25 motorway, which provides quick access to Lesquin airport and other motorways in France such as the A1 to Paris.
