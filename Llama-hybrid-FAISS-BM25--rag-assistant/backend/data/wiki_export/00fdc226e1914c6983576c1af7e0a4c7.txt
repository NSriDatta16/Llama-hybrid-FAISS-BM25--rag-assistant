The squadron was initially equipped with Defiants and undertook target towing duties with these. It later received Hurricanes, Barracudas, Oxfords, Vengeances and Spitfires, before disbanding at Gosport on 20 December 1945. Between Dec 1943 and Dec 1945 squadron aircraft wore the codes U4.  During the Second World War the squadron formed part of No. 70 Group RAF, Air Defence of Great Britain from 1943 to 1944 and Fighter Command from 1944 to 1945

From 1989 to 2000 the squadron had a development and trials role as part of the Army Air Corps. The squadron continued in this rule until late 2020 when it was disbanded.
