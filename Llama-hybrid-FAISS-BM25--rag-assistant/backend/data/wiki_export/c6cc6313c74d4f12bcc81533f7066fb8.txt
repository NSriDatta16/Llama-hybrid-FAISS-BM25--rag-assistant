Roncalli High School is a private, Catholic high school located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, USA. It is owned by the Diocese of Green Bay. Founded in 1965 by the De La Salle Christian Brothers, Roncalli High School is named for Pope John XXIII (né Angelo Roncalli).  Roncalli offers a college-prep curriculum. In 2022, the school merged with the Catholic elementary and middle schools, becoming known as Roncalli Catholic Schools.

The school's mascot is the Jets. The gymnasium is called “Kersten Court”, also known as "the Hangar".  A Fine Arts Center for the visual and performing arts is the newest addition. The Zimmer Auditorium hosts four dramatic productions and six instrumental and choral concerts each year.
