It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown is the 39th and last animated special produced under the supervision of Charles M. Schulz. Based on characters from the comic strip Peanuts, it was originally released exclusively in VHS and DVD formats on September 12, 2000, seven months after Schulz's death.

Plot
Charlie Brown tells his little sister Sally the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

The town of Hamelin is infested with mice whose antics disrupt the daily lives of the town citizens. In hopes of solving the problem, the mayor hires the "Pied Piper Beagle" (Snoopy) and promises to pay him with a year's supply of dog food.  Snoopy plays a concertina and lures the mice out of town. When the mayor refuses to pay Snoopy, the "Pied Piper Beagle" uses his instrument to lure the mayor and his assistants out of town as well.

Charlie Brown finishes his story and Sally insists such a thing would not happen in real life. From his doghouse outside, Snoopy begins playing music. Linus, Lucy, Franklin and Peppermint Patty dance to the beat, until Lucy demands Snoopy stop.
