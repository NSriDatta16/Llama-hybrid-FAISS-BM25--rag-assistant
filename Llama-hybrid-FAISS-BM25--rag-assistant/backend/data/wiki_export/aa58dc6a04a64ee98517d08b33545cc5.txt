Black Legend version

A cover version in 2000, credited to Italian musical group Black Legend, originally sampled Barry White; however, White had not given permission for this, so the vocals were re-recorded by Black Legend member Elroy "Spoonface" Powell. This 2000 version was a hit across Europe, reaching number one in the UK in June of that year. The song was the 40th-best-selling single of 2000 in the UK.
