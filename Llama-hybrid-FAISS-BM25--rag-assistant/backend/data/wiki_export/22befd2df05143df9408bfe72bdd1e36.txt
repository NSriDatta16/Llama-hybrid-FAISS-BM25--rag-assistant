Milan Stojanoski (; born 15 September 1973) is a Macedonian football manager and former player.

Club career
Born in Stari Lec, a village near Plandište, Stojanoski started his professional career as a striker with Proleter Zrenjanin. He played four seasons for the club (1993–1997), making 120 appearances in the top flight and scoring 41 goals. In the summer of 1997, Stojanoski was transferred to Partizan. He stayed there over the next three seasons, winning one national championship (1999) and one national cup (1998).

In May 2000, Stojanoski moved to Israeli club Beitar Jerusalem, signing a three-year contract. He returned to Partizan after only one year, spending the following three seasons with the Crno-beli. In his second stint at the club, Stojanoski was a member of the team that won back-to-back championship titles in 2002 and 2003. He also made five appearances in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, mostly playing as a sweeper.

In June 2004, Stojanoski signed with Cypriot club APOEL, on a two-year deal. He won the Cypriot Super Cup shortly upon his arrival, but eventually left the club in January 2005. Subsequently, Stojanoski moved to Iran, spending the next three seasons with Pegah (2005–2007) and Shahrdari Bandar Abbas (2007–2008).

In the summer of 2008, Stojanoski returned to Serbia and joined SuperLiga club Banat Zrenjanin. He failed to help them avoid relegation, as the team finished bottom of the table. Before retiring from his playing career, Stojanoski also spent some time with lower league clubs BASK, Lokomotiva Beograd, and Kovačevac.

International career
Between 1996 and 2004, Stojanoski represented Macedonia at international level, making 26 appearances and scoring one goal.

Managerial career
In the summer of 2011, Stojanoski started his managerial career by taking charge of his former club Kovačevac. He was appointed manager of Radnički Pirot in March 2012. However, Stojanoski left the club by mutual consent in October 2012, being replaced by Mile Tomić. He was also manager of Lokomotiva Beograd (2013) and Dolina Padina (2015).
