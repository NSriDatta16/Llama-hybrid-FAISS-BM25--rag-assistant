At Providence, Sable earned a bachelor's degree in health service administration/social work and later a master's degree in education.

Broadcasting career
Burke began her broadcasting career in 1990 as an analyst for women's games for her alma mater on radio. That same year, she began working in the same role on Big East Women's games on television, and in 1996 she began working Big East men's games.

Burke has been working for ESPN in various positions since 1991. She has been a part of ESPN's coverage of the WNBA. For many years she was the primary radio and television voice of the New York Liberty. In 2003, Burke was named to ESPN's men's college basketball coverage working with Dick Vitale and began working the sidelines for ESPN and ABC for their coverage of the NBA beginning with the 2003â€“04 NBA season.

In 2000, Burke became the first woman to be a commentator for a New York Knicks game on radio and on television; she is also the first woman to be a commentator for a Big East men's game, and the first woman to be the primary commentator on a men's college basketball conference package. From 2009 to 2019, she served as a sideline reporter for the NBA Finals on ABC, and worked as an analyst in select regular season and playoff games until 2017.

In 2010, she was featured as the new sideline reporter for 2K Sports's NBA 2K11 video game. She has appeared in each edition since, including the latest in the series, NBA 2K23.

In October 2013, Burke signed a multiyear contract extension to serve as an NBA commentator for ESPN.  On November 13, Burke debuted on ESPN's NBA pre-game show NBA Countdown, alongside analysts Jalen Rose and Avery Johnson.

In 2017, Burke became a regular NBA game analyst for ESPN, becoming the first woman at the national level to be assigned a full regular-season role. Burke replaced Doug Collins, who left ESPN for a job with the Chicago Bulls, but continued sideline reporting for the conference finals and the NBA Finals until 2019. In 2020, she began calling the Conference Finals and the NBA Finals on ESPN Radio, making her the first woman to call the conference finals and NBA Finals on radio.

In 2022, she worked with play-by-play commentator Beth Mowins in calling an NBA game, as part of ESPN's plan to have an all-women broadcasting and production crew for the first time on a national scale. Mowins and Burke returned together the following season during International Women's Day 2023.

In August 2023, ESPN announced that Burke, along with Mike Breen and former NBA coach Doc Rivers, would form their lead broadcasting team. This makes Burke the first woman to serve as a television analyst for a major men's championship in the US, and the first woman TV analyst for the NBA Conference Finals and the NBA Finals.

Personal life
Burke is divorced from Gregg Burke (head golf coach at University of Rhode Island), with whom she has two children.
