History
Trinity Law School, as it is now known, was founded in 1980 as the Simon Greenleaf School of Law.  It was originally located at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, in Santa Ana, California, and in 1982 it relocated to Anaheim, California. In 1997, it relocated from Anaheim to its current location at 2200 N. Grand Ave. in Santa Ana. It was named in honor of the nineteenth century Harvard law professor Simon Greenleaf who was an authority on the laws of evidence and also wrote The Testimony of the Evangelists: The Gospels Examined by the Rules of Evidence, which was a work of Christian apologetics concerning the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The Simon Greenleaf School of Law was cofounded by John Warwick Montgomery. Montgomery rose to prominence in the 1960s as a confessional Lutheran theologian and as a Christian apologist. He held the chair of Professor of Church History at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, Illinois (1964â€“74). A founding board of trustees collaborated with Montgomery to establish in 1980 the Simon Greenleaf School of Law.  It commenced operations by offering evening classes that led to the J.D. degree as well as a Bachelor of Science in Law (B.S.L.). Additionally, a one-and-a-half year post-graduate course in Christian Apologetics and International Human Rights was offered that led to the conferral of a Master of Arts degree.

In 1997, the law school became a part of Trinity International University (TIU), an evangelical Christian institution of higher education headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, and operated by the Evangelical Free Church of America.
