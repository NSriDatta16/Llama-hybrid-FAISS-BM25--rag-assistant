New school
In the spring of 2004 a bond election was successfully passed, approving the necessary funding for a new high school. The school was to be sited on Cathcart Way, and completion was scheduled for September 2008.

The Seattle Times noted that "the projected cost of [the] new Snohomish-district high school has risen from $68 million to $76 million, [and] the estimated cost of a major renovation to Snohomish High School has climbed from $64 million to $71 million."

According to the Everett Herald, the new school project could receive up to 16.2 million dollars in state grants, as approved by the state superintendent's office in 2006.

The district also built an elementary school, Little Cedars Elementary, which opened in fall 2007.

The new high school was named "Glacier Peak High School" by the committee on the end of May. Its colors are white, blue, and silver. The mascot is a Grizzly Bear.
