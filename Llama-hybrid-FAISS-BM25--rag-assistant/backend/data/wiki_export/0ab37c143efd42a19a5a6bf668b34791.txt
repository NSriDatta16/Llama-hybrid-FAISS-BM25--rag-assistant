Live Phish Vol. 5 was recorded live at Alpine Valley in East Troy, Wisconsin, a small town that is located  southwest of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 8, 2000.

At the time of its release, the album received a mixed reaction from fans, as it seemed to be a rather standard Phish concert compared to other shows from the band's 2000 summer tour. Moreover, the band was known for playing a special setlist of songs at Alpine Valley, ranging from rare covers and first-time performances.

Regardless of the somewhat basic setlist, the band embarks on several improvisational flights, including the 15-minute "Piper" and an extended, bluesy solo from Trey Anastasio on an 11-minute version of Jeff Holdsworth's "Possum".

Three months later, the band would take an indefinite hiatus from recording and touring. They returned for a New Year's Eve performance in 2002 at Madison Square Garden (NY, NY), MSG being their home venue for past and present NYE throwdowns.
