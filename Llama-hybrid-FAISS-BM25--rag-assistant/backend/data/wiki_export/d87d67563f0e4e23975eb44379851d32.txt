Private Audition is the sixth studio album by American rock band Heart, released on May 20, 1982, by Epic Records. The album reached number 25 on the US Billboard 200, spending 14 weeks on the chart. It spawned the single "This Man Is Mine", which peaked at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is the last Heart album to feature longtime members Mike Derosier and Steve Fossen, who left after the recording of the album and were replaced by Denny Carmassi and Mark Andes.

In 2009, Private Audition was re-released by BGO Records as a double CD with the band's subsequent album, Passionworks (1983). Prior to this, Private Audition had been out of print for a number of years and was Heart's most difficult CD to obtain.
