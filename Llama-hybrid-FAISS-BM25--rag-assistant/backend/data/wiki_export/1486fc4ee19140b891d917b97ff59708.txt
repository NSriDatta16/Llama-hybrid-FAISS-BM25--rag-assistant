Stephen John Leaney (born 10 March 1969) is a professional golfer from Australia.

Born in Busselton, Western Australia, Leaney turned professional in 1992 and won several tournaments in Australia in the 1990s, despite having two ribs cut removed in December 1993 after doctors diagnosed a blood clot in his shoulder. Leaney has since spoken to W.A media and confirmed the threatening injury may have been caused from his prior to golf career in premier league darts. Between 1998 and 2003 he made the top 15 on the European Tour Order of Merit three times and won four European Tour events. Since 2004 he has played mainly on the based PGA Tour, but he has performed only moderately. His best finish in the United States remains a second place at the U.S. Open in 2003. He has featured in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings.

Leaney has represented his country several times as an amateur and a professional and was a member of the International Team at the 2003 Presidents Cup.
