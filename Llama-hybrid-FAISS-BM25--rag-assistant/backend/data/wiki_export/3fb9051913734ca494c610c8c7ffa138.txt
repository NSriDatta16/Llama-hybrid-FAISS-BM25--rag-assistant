Charles Mercer Snelling (November 3, 1862 – September 19, 1939) was the chancellor of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia, from 1925 to 1932 and the first chancellor of the Georgia Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia (1932–1933). All UGA leaders after Snelling have been referred to as president (the previous title before the 1860 University reorganization that created the UGA Chancellor position).

He taught mathematics there when he graduated, then at the Georgia Military Institute in 1885–1886, as well as a 2-year stint teaching at South Georgia College in Thomasville. Snelling came to the university in 1888 as an adjunct professor of mathematics and commandant of cadets. He became a professor in 1897, and dean of the university in 1909.
