History 
At one time all goods trains had to stop here for inspection before proceeding. On the bleak section beyond the station the London, Midland and Scottish Railway constructed water troughs to permit longer non-stop passenger express runs to be included in the schedules of the Scottish Division. The station closed in 1965 but was reopened by British Rail in 1991.

Services 
As of 2023, there are eight trains per day to Glasgow Central and seven trains per day to Carlisle on Mondays to Fridays, on a mostly two-hourly frequency; however it is an uneven frequency meaning there is gaps of up to three hours at certain times of the day. Three trains per day only go as far as Dumfries. Saturday services remain mostly the same except there are only two trains that terminate at Dumfries. On Sundays a limited service of just two trains per day each way operate.

Before the May 2022 timetable change, one of the Carlisle trains extended through to Newcastle.This service was withdrawn at the aforementioned timetable change.
