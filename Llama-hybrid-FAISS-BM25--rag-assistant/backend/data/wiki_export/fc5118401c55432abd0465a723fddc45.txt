Caseoides is an extinct genus of large caseid synapsids that lived in the Kungurian Age (late Early Permian epoch). It was about  long, and like many other caseids, it was herbivorous and aquatic. It weighed between . Its fossils were found in San Angelo Formation, Texas. Caseoides was very similar to Casea, but was slightly larger in size. Caseoides was a heavily built creature, as are most of the Caseids (except Caseopsis).  In the development of its proportionally thick, stout limbs it represents the culmination of the Casea lineage. Its relatives became smaller in size during the Roadian Age. Only poorly preserved postcranial material is known including limbs.
