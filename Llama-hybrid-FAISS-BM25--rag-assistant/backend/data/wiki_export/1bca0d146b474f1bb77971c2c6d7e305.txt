The mottled triplefin (Forsterygion malcolmi) is a triplefin of the genus Forsterygion, found around New Zealand at depths down to 30 m, in reef areas of broken rock. Its specific name honours Malcolm Francis of the Fisheries Research Centre in Wellington, New Zealand, who joined Hardy on his trips to collect specimens.
