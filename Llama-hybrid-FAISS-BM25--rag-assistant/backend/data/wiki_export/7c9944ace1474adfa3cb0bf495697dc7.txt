History
In 1874, Mrs Sophia Lombe White opened a small boarding school for boys aged 8–13 on the Sussex Coast in a building named Marlborough House. This was the predecessor of today’s Marlborough House School.

The school has four houses: Awdry, Dunbar, Egan and Hawkings, named after the first Marlborough House School families who lost a son in the Great War. 
 
In 1930, the founding White family purchased the New Lodge estate in Hawkhurst from the Hardcastle family, and moved the school to the school's present site. They also adopted the Hardcastle family crest, which remains the school crest.

The core of the school remains the ‘main building’ – an 18th century country house. This building has adapted for 21st century schooling and complemented with new buildings such as Pre-Prep, the Harrison Building and the Sports Hall. The school's grounds have also been updated in recent years with the addition of an outdoor swimming pool, shooting range, Forest School, play areas, an astroturf and tennis courts.
