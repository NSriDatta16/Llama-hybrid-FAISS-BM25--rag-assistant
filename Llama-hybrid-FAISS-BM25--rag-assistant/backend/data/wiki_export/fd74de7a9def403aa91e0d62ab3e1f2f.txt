King Biscuit Flower Hour: Greatest Hits Live is a compilation live album by the progressive rock supergroup Emerson, Lake & Palmer. It features tracks from two different tours: The 1973–1974 Brain Salad Surgery Tour, and the 1977 Works Tour.

Tracks 1–10 on Disc One were recorded on November 12, 1977, at the Coliseum (now the WesBanco Arena) in Wheeling, West Virginia. This is the first (and possibly only) official release of these recordings. The band's last concert with an orchestra on the 1977 Works Tour was at Olympic Stadium in Montreal on August 26 and they performed the rest of the tour as a trio, which is the ensemble featured here.

Tracks 11–14 on Disc One and Track 1 on Disc Two were recorded on 7 March 1974 at the Civic Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
