Furia Livia Medullina Camilla (ca. 6 BC-ca 10 AD) was the second fiancee of the future Emperor Claudius.

Biography
Medullina was the daughter of Marcus Furius Camillus consul in AD 8, who was a close friend of the emperor Tiberius and Livia Scriboniana, the daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Libo (born Lucius Scribonius Libo), the adopted brother of the empress Livia. As a child, Medullina may have been called by the names Furia and Camilla (possibly along with her other names), but as an adult she seems to have been referred to mainly as "Livia Medullina". Her nomen gentilicium Furia is not actually attested but can be assumed to have been used at some point due to Roman naming conventions for women at the time.

Medullina's brother was Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus, who had been adopted by Lucius Arruntius. He was consul in AD 32, as the colleague of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. 

Medullina was betrothed to Claudius some time after his first engagement, to his relative Aemilia Lepida, was broken by Augustus in AD 8, due to the disgrace of Aemilia's parents. Tiberius probably pushed for the new betrothal, in order to reward his friend with a connection to the imperial family. The betrothal of Medullina and Claudius is attested by an inscription erected by Camilla's pedagogue, dedicated to "Medullina Camilli f. Ti. Claudi Neronis Germanici sponsa" (Medullina, daughter of Camillus, betrothed of Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus).

In The Twelve Caesars, Suetonius states that Medullina unexpectedly fell ill, and died on the day of her wedding to Claudius, possibly in AD 9 or 10.

Medullina's brother Scribonianus was the instigator of the first major rebellion against Claudius, while he was governor of Dalmatia in AD 42.

Cultural depictions
In Robert Graves' novel I, Claudius, Medullina Camilla is depicted as an early love of Claudius, who is able to look past his infirmities.  Against Livia Drusilla's wishes, Claudius is permitted to marry Medullina by Germanicus and Augustus. However, Claudius is robbed of happiness on the day of the engagement as Medullina Camilla is assassinated, purportedly for an unrelated vendetta against Medullina's uncle.
