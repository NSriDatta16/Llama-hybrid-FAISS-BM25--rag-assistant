TV8 is a digital-terrestrial free-to-air Italian general entertainment TV channel owned by Sky Italia through its subsidiary company Nuova Società Televisiva Italiana S.r.l. The channel is allocated at number 8 of the Italian virtual channel list.

History
On 31 July 2015 Sky Italia took over ownership of the free-to-air MTV Italy. On 14 September 2015, MTV Italy was rebranded as MTV8 by Sky Italia.

On the same day, Viacom launched a new MTV-channel for Italy, MTV Next (now MTV), and is now only available as a subscription service on Sky. This ended an era where MTV Italy was available to the majority of homes across Italy free-to-air. The Music-station of Viacom in Italy, MTV Music remained available free to air until 1 July 2016, when it moved to Sky Italia.

The Birth of TV8

On 8 January 2016, Sky introduced new on-air graphics for MTV8 focusing on the number 8 and launched the channel's website.

On 18 February 2016, Sky changed the channel name to TV8.

Programming
TV8's programming consists essentially of reruns of Sky programmes, comedy shows, crime shows, UEFA Europa League matches, delayed MotoGP and Formula 1, live Superbike World Championship and movies, but also few original shows.
