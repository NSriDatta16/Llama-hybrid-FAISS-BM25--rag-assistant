History
The province was created in 1974 from the territory of the historical province of Ñuble. Two years later, the communes of Coelemu and Ránquil from Concepción Province, and the commune of Tucapel from Bío Bío Province, were added.
 
Following the 8.8 magnitude earthquake and tsunami, at least eight small communities and two towns were abandoned by residents, who took up makeshift camps in the hills, fearful of further tsunamis. Over 800 residences in the town of Quirihue were destroyed, leaving little for townspeople to return to.

In 2015 the Ñuble Region law which converts the Ñuble Province into a Region, was proposed. In August 2017 a law to create the new territorial division was promulgated by the President of the Republic in Chillán. It became operational on 6 September 2018.
