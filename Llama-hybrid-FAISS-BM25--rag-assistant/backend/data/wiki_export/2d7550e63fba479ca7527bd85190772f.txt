Altaelva (; ; ) is the third-longest river in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. The river begins in the mountains and lakes in Kautokeino Municipality, near the border with Troms og Finnmark county and Finland, just south of Reisa National Park.

The villages of Kautokeino and Masi are located along the river, in addition to the town of Alta.
