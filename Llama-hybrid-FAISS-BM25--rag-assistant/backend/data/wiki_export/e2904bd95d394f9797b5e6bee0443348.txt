History 

There are no signs of human inhabitants before the German migration in about the 11th century. The first mention of the name Langnau (German lange Au or Lanngnouw meaning long pasture/meadow) dates to 1139.  In 1246 it was mentioned as Langenowe.

Like other towns in the Emmental, Langnau was not built along the river because of the danger of flooding. Instead, it was built on higher ground along one of the streams flowing into the Emme.

The earliest noble landowners seem to have been the Kyburg family. A fort was erected on the Spitzenegg hill in Gohl by the barons of Spitzenberg. This fortification was sold to the sons of Rudolf von Habsburg in 1300. A Benedictine monastery was established in Trub in 1130, and it held ownership of large tracts of land.

After the Battle of Sempach in 1386, where the Swiss Confederation defeated the troops led by Duke Leopold III of Habsburg, the Bernese established their authority over the area. However, there were continued clashes with the authorities in Lucerne. In 1528, Bern imposed the Protestant religion on the entire region.

In 1653, there was a farmers' insurrection due to the economic crisis after the end of the Thirty Years' War and the persecution of the Anabaptists (Mennonites). The insurrection was put down, and persecution continued until about 1730. Many Anabaptists left the area to settle in the Jura mountains.

In the 18th century, Langnau was an important center of the canvas and cheese trades. It was larger than any other town in the area, including Burgdorf. The railroad reached Langnau in 1864 from Bern, and continued to Lucerne in 1875. With the opening of the Gotthard line in 1882, the line through Langnau became the fastest access route to the south until the opening of the Lötschberg Tunnel in 1913.
