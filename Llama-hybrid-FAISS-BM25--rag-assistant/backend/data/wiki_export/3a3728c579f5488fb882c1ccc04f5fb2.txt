Marcus LaJuan Pollard (born February 8, 1972) is a former American football tight end and current director of player development and youth football for the Jacksonville Jaguars.

College career
Born in Lanett, Alabama, Pollard attended Valley High School of Valley, Alabama and  Bradley University of Peoria, Illinois, where he played basketball.  Bradley did not have a football program at the time he matriculated there.  He played basketball as a power forward â€“ two years starting at Seward County Community College in Liberal, Kansas, before transferring to Bradley, where he also started two years, averaging 7.3 points per game and 5 rebounds, while shooting .497 from the field.  In 1993, he helped the team reach the third round of the National Invitational Tournament.

Professional career
Despite the fact he never played college football, Pollard was signed by the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent in 1995. He developed into one of the better pass-catching tight ends while with the Colts.  His best season was 2001, when he totaled 47 receptions and 8 touchdowns, including one for 86 yards. On November 11, 2004, Pollard caught two touchdown passes to help the Colts to a 31-28 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. After the emergence of fellow tight end Dallas Clark in Indianapolis left Pollard expendable, Pollard joined the Detroit Lions for two seasons. Pollard was also a member of the Seattle Seahawks, New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons.
