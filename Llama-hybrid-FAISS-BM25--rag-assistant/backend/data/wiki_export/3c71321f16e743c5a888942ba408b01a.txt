A change of venue was asked for and granted and a new trial was set for February 1967, in Wichita Falls, Texas. Ruby, meanwhile, had died of cancer while in prison.
In addition to representing O'Hair, Clinton won a lawsuit to desegregate women's dormitories at the University of Texas at Austin in the late 1960s.
