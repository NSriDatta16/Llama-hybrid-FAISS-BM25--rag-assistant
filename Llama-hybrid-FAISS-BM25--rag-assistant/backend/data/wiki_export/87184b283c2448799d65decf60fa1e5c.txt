Operas 

Eichberg's chamber opera Glare, with libretto by Hannah Dübgen, was commissioned by Royal Opera House and opened in London in November 2014. Glare is a psycho-drama chamber-play with elements of science fiction, which focuses on the relationships between four protagonists one of who may or may not be an artificial human. It gained attention among bloggers, twitterers and the press with some calling it too violent, while others praised it as the perfect opera for the digital age. Richard Morrison in his review in The Times gave it 5 out of 5 stars saying that he couldn't remember a more gripping 75 minutes of avant-garde music-theatre than Glare. The opera has since been staged in Koblenz, the National Swedish Touring Theatre and at Opera North.

Eichberg's following opera about the European refugee crisis premiered at Staatstheater Wiesbaden in September 2017. In 2019 Theater Koblenz premiered his opera "Wolf unter Wölfen" with libretto by .
