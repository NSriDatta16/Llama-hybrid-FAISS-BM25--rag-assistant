Triolet is a medium-sized town in the north of Mauritius, found in the district of Pamplemousses. It lies exactly 11 kilometres from Port Louis, the capital of the island. The town is nestled amidst green sugarcane fields, near the north-western coast of the island. As per the 2016 population census, Triolet had 24 073 inhabitants and a population density of 2764 inhabitants per km2, over an area of 8.71 m2. The population density is higher than that of the township of Vacoas-Phoenix which is at 1948 inhabitants per km2.

To the north of Triolet lie Trou-aux-Biches, Mont Choisy and Grand Baie which are coastal villages, while to its west are Pointe-aux-Piments and Balaclava. On the south lies Arsenal and to the east are Morcellement St André and Plaine des Papayes.

Economy 
The economy of Triolet has historically mostly been agricultural. Like other agglomerations in Mauritius, it was largely set up from Indian origin Indentured workers and African slaves working on the sugar estates around, the latest of which to shut down was the Solitude estate. With time the population has evolved and many of the indentured workers evolved to small planters and land-owners. Following the diversification policies of the 70's, 80's and 90's sizeable parts of the population moved to manufacturing and tourism. Recently a significant portion of the population has also gone into the civil service and service sectors, especially IT and Finance.

Infrastructure 

Triolet has a main road that is almost perfectly straight, which goes all the way to the north-western coastal village and popular tourist resort Grand Baie. Along this main road most of the infrastructure has developed. It has mostly parallel secondary roads that cross at right-angles.

There is a village hall where political and administrative decisions are taken, a women's centre and a youth centre. Triolet has most government services operations represented, including Police, Fire Station, Post Office, National Pensions Office and Social Security Office. A government library can also be found, behind the Social Welfare centre. It is sometimes referred to as the CLAP. Although the library is stocked with classical authors, the collection is not thorough and well-arranged. However, the library has a poor collection of modern fiction, which is often a cause of complaint. The library is frequented by students of the nearby schools.

It also has three government primary schools and various private primary schools. It has two state secondary schools, Lady Sushil Ramgoolam State Secondary School, Triolet State Secondary School for Boys, and one private secondary school, the International College.

Lately, various banks have opened in Triolet, with nearly every bank on the island having a branch there. There are various major department stores such as Courts Ltd, J Kalachand Ltd, Galaxy Ltd.

Infrastructural developments include a children's playground and market situated in the Bon-Air road which leads to Morcellement St. Andre.

Triolet has one football field the Rabindranath Ghurburrun Stadium that is used for local football tournaments. This is not really a stadium as it is not regularly maintained and has little or no seating arrangements.

A sports complex is believed to be planned to cater for the lack of sports facilities in the village.

Etymology 

The word "Triolet" has its origins in a very specific type of French poem, before the French renaissance. Un "Triolet", a "Triplet" in English, denotes a very specific type of poem. Triolet is the oldest and simplest form of poetry that was used during the golden age of lyric poetry.

The Triolet is also a method for timekeeping in western classical music, where the time-scale of a note is divided into 3 distinctive divisions (rather than into 2), which may or may not be of equal length. Their being three, gives rise to the word Triolet, the French equivalent of triplet. This is demonstrated in the article on the western music.

The Maheshwarnath Temple legend 
According to legend during the town's main Hindu temple's construction a huge pot of gold and silver coins were found buried on the very spot where the temple was being made. It is believed by many that this gold must have belonged to Indian Ocean pirates from the previous century, who used to attack east Indian company ships for their gold and other precious goods. The money found was then used for the construction of the temple.

The first Maha Shivratree Pilgrimage 
The presence the Maheshwarnath Temple, the largest of its kind on the island, contributes to the religious significance of the village. The village is believed to be the starting point for the first-ever Mahashivaratree pilgrimage. The pilgrimage began when a  resident of Triolet had a vision of a sacred lake surrounded by dense forestry.

A group of sages, set out on a journey inland in search for this lake. They discovered the Ganga Talao, also known as the Grand-Bassin (literally: the big lake). With time, this has given a major significance to the Mahashivratri festival on the island and people from several Hindu Traditions on the island annually converge to this sacred river, the local equivalent of the Ganges River.

It was traditionally a fortress of the Ramgoolam political dynasty, and a pro-Mauritius Labour Party constituency. However, a significant portion of its population also support the Jugnauth dynasty. The various groups that confront each other in village elections bear more or less allegiance to one of these two main parties.
In the 2014 general elections, the Prime Minister at that time, Dr. Ramgoolam, lost his seat at the assembly as he lost the elections in constituency number five.
