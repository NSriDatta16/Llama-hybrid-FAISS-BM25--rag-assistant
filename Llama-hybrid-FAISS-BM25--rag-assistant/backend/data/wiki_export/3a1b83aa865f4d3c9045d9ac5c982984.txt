Iggy or Iggie is a unisex name and it is often a short form of the Roman Latin names Ignatia (feminine) and Ignatius (masculine), or their derivatives in other European languages. As such the name is derived ultimately from the Etruscan language family name Egnat, the meaning of which is unknown. (The Romans added the Latin nominative endings -ia and -ius.) A spelling with an initial "I" later became dominant, possibly because of a resemblance to the Latin word ignis "fire".

Iggy or Iggie may also refer to:
