The name Kallangur originates from the Indigenous Australian word kalangoor, meaning a goodly or satisfactory place. Kallangur is situated in the Yugarabul traditional Indigenous Australian country of the Brisbane and surrounding regions, however, the word kalangoor is from the Kabi dialect, from the traditional Indigenous Australian Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi) country of the Sunshine Coast and surrounding regions.
