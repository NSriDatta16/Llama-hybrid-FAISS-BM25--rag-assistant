The Western Stage
In 1974, Ron Danko established on campus The Western Stage, a professional theater organization with an educational mission. Initially a summer theatre festival, the Western Stage now produces an annual year-round season of plays, produces school tours, offers internships, and youth classes. The company's productions are part of the college's curriculum, though a separate foundation was established to support the Western Stage.
