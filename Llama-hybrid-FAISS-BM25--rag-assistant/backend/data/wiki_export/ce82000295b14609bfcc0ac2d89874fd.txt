Lazarevo (; ) is a village located in the Zrenjanin municipality, in the Central Banat District of Serbia. It is situated in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The village has a Serb ethnic majority (94.77%) and a total population of 3,308 people (2002 census).

The village is known as the place where Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladić was arrested on 26 May 2011.

Name
In Serbian, the village is known as Lazarevo (Лазарево), in Croatian as Lazarevo, in Hungarian as Lázárföld, and in German as Lazarfeld. Lazarfeld is also an older name for the village used in Serbian.

History

The village was founded in 1809 by German colonists. In 1800, the first German immigrants arrived at the enormous estate of János Lázár de Écska, the son of Lukács Lázár. “Martinica pusta” was determined as a location for their settlement. It was, besides Ečka and Jankov Most, the third settlement founded on Lukács Lázár’s estate. In his honor it was named Lazarfeld.

In 1922, the village changed its name to Lazarevo. Until the end of World War II, it was mostly inhabited by ethnic Germans. After World War II, the German population was placed into concentration camps and the village was colonized by Serb families from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Russian advance towards Berlin in Oct 1944 left all ethnic Germans at the will of Partisians whom killed, raped, and brutalized all Swabians in the regions they controlled. From 1.5 million Ethnic Swabians, only 550,000 were left on the Banat at the end of WW2.

Lazarevo was the last shelter of the Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladić who was arrested here by the Serbian special police forces in the early morning hours of 26 May 2011. The arrest took place without incident as Mladić surrendered himself as well as two pistols that he carried.
