History

The first written documents relating to Bajmok came from the fifteenth century. Then the village was for the first time officially mentioned as a village. King Matthias gave it to his mother, Erzsébet Szilágyi. The deed of donation was confirmed on 16 February 1462.

During Ottoman administration (16th-17th century), two villages with this name were mentioned: Bajmok and Novi Bajmok. Both villages had about 20 houses. Population was composed of ethnic Serbs. These villages existed until the beginning of the 18th century when they were abandoned.

The village was rebuilt between 1770 and 1785. In this time, settlers were mainly Bunjevci and Hungarians. At the time of the Hungarian revolution, in the fields of this village there was a conflict between the Hungarian and the Vojvodinian Serb army, won by the Hungarians.

In 1910, population of the village was mainly composed of Hungarians, Bunjevci and Germans, with some Serbs living there as well.

After World War I, new Serb settlers came to the village. During the Second World War, this village was under the Hungarian occupation. Many of the citizens  were exiled from their homes (including the Hungarian population) to make room for Csango newcomers. Bajmok was liberated from the Hungarian fascists on 19 October 1944.

After World War II, 2,090 (mostly Serb) colonists settled in Bajmok, which enlarged village population to 11,789.

Until 1991, the largest ethnic group in the village were Hungarians. By the 2002 census, Serbs were listed as the single largest ethnic group in Bajmok.
