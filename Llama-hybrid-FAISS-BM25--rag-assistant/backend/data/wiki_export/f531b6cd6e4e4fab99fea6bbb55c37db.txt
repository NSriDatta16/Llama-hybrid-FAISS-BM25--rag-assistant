All admissions are through the Monmouth County Vocational School District administration offices. They accept 85 applicants via a highly competitive points system. The total number of points possible is 100 and the minimum to be considered is 75. The point scoring is as follows:

CHS accepts the top ranking student from each school district. After the first round, all left over positions go to the highest scoring applicants from every school district. There are, generally, no more acceptances after this, as there is over-enrollment in anticipation that some students will not accept the invitation.

Academics

Classes operate on block scheduling. Each day is divided into four class periods and a lunch/activity period. The classes run for 85 minutes each. The lunch/activity period is placed between the second and third periods, and lasts for approximately 1 hour. Students eat lunch and participate in school clubs during that time period.

The school year is divided into two semesters. Students will attend a 5-credit class five times a week for one semester. Classes worth 2.5 credits will be attended every day for half the semester and then swapped with another class halfway through the semester; classes worth 2.5 credits are rarely given every other day. Each course is taught at an honors level even if the course name is not denoted with that designation. Students who pass every class will acquire 40 credits each school year. Students must have 160 credits in order to graduate, though the state of New Jersey only requires 120 credits to graduate from high school.

CHS requires that students explore many options during their first two years at the school. The only language offered at CHS is Spanish, and students must take at least three courses of the language. Students are required to take four years of Math, English and Science. Gym and Health classes are required every year, but seniors must fulfill class requirements outside of the school setting.

Seniors are also required to fulfill a mentorship. For one-quarter of the school year, students spend periods 3 and 4 at the mentorship site of their choice.  Mentorship sites in the past have included the Asbury Park Press, Lab Volt, Brookdale Television, architectural firms, graphic design firms, radio stations, and schools. Students have freedom choosing where they are mentored.

Student activities
Student activities include Student Government Association, Drama Club, National Honor Society, Radio Club, Digital Video Club, Photography Club, Broadcast Club, Skills USA/National Technical Honor Society, Yearbook, National Art Honor Society, and the Newspaper Club, which produces the school newspaper, "The Inkblot."
