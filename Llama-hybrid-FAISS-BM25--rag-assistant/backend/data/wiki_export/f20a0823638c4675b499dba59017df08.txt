The Breckenridge 100 is an ultra-endurance mountain bike race held annually in mid July in Breckenridge, Colorado. 

At the same time the Breck 100 is being held, the organization offer three others options; solo 68 miles, solo 32 miles and a team relay. Initially this race offered just two distance classes,  and  and no awards were presented to those doing the shorter version, it simply offered an easier alternative for those riders not ready to race the full 100 miles. The race was part of the National Ultra Endurance Series until 2012 and will be again in 2017.   

The sprawling course is nestled between three ski resorts and features a distinct cloverleaf format of three loops that each begin and finish in Carter Park, adjacent to historic downtown Breckenridge.  The race crosses the Continental Divide of the Americas three times, once at Wheeler Pass at an elevation over 12,400 ft and twice at Boreas Pass at an elevation of 11,492 ft.  The course climbs a total of 13,719 feet, and includes backcountry trails, roads, double track, bike paths, and high mountain stream crossings.
