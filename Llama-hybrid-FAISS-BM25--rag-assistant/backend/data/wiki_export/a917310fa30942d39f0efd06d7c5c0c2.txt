Nakoda ji is one of the famous Jain temple of India. This sacred tirtha is at a distance of 13 km from Balotara Railway station and 1 km from Mewad city. It is situated in the forest in the hills. In this tirtha with a charming natural atmosphere all-around, we have an idol of Mulnayaka Shri Parshvanath Bhagavan. It is black in complexion, 58 cm in height and in Padmasana posture. The idol is extremely charming and miraculous. The miracles of the presiding deity of this spot, Shri Bhairavaji Maharaj are well-known. We have a reference which states that the ancient name of Nakoda was Virampur. It is said that in the third century before the Vikrama era, two brothers, Shri Virasen and Shri Nakoresen raised two villages Virampur and Nakorenagar at a distance of twenty miles. They also got constructed two temples of Shri Chandraprabhu Bhagavan and Shri Suparshva Bhagavan.

The main idol is that of Shri Nakoda Parsvanatha. This statue was brought here from the village Nakoda which is near Sinduri, hence the place is called Nakoda Parsvanath temple. But this alone is not the attraction of the temple. The idol of Shri Nakoda Bheruji was installed by Acharya Shri Vijay Himachal Suri who also established idols of other Teerthankars in this temple.

This is a very ancient temple and the construction work has been going over the centuries. This place has become a pilgrimage that people from every religion visits here.

Although the temple is very ancient one but from time to time renovations and repairs and additions have been made to the temple. So it is in a very sound position. The temple has about 246 inscriptions which amply show that over the centuries, the temple was extended, renovated, rebuilt and additions were made to it.
