David Sale is an American singer-songwriter, who, after releasing "Sins of the Father" on Atlantic Records under the name Camus, and co-writing and producing other projects, he started investigating wrongful convictions. The transition landed him on the front page of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, when he got involved in the case of Mark Woodworth, a rural farm boy who was framed for murder by questionable characters. He was called to a case in the mountains of Tennessee. Adam Braseel, a young man visiting old high school friends, who was framed for murder back in 2007, but exonerated by Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee.

Sale used his creative talents when he setup a Horror Movie to investigate in a place where few wanted to talk at first. Sale then got a call from Wayne Grimes from prison and has been working to free him as well as a few others.

Sale, achieved notability back in the 90's as Camus with "sins of the Father", a release on Atlantic Records. The album includes the song Ouch which was featured on the Baywatch episode "Out of the Blue" alongside Cyndi Lauper. In this project he had the opportunity to collaborate with Producers David Kahne and Kevin Killin. He still writes music for short films he puts out on the cases.
