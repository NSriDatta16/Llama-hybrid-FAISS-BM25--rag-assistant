TROS, originally an acronym for Televisie Radio Omroep Stichting ("Television Radio Broadcasting Foundation"), was a Dutch television and radio organisation part of the Dutch public broadcasting system. This broadcasting association was particularly well known for its entertainment programmes, quizzes and focus on Dutch folk music in programmes like  and the digital channel TROS Sterren TV.

In 2014 TROS merged with fellow broadcaster AVRO to form AVROTROS.

History
A group of entrepreneurs who disliked the type and amount of TV shown by the single public broadcasting channel in the Netherlands acquired a North Sea off-shore drilling platform - the REM Island - and mounted a TV transmitter and started broadcast to American TV-shows like Mr. Ed, the talking horse.

This new unofficial TV proved quite popular, but was shut down by a government raid, as the government claimed the islands transmitter trespassed frequency spectrum regulations. Due to the popular outcry and political turmoil caused by this venture, the entrepreneurs jumped on the offered opportunity to go legitimate, as an addition to the 5 private broadcasting associations that were distributed time slots based on their membership in the Dutch public broadcasting system. They founded TROS.

TROS was established in 1964 and grew rapidly.

Its arrival was a different development in the area as it did not originate in religious or political beginnings of the other broadcasters, but aimed at providing programmes that its viewers wished to see.

It soon became obvious that viewers mostly preferred American television series and light-hearted programs. Other television and radio stations began to follow suit to maintain an audience. To describe this phenomenon, the name, 'TROS', was even turned into a verb. This was mostly a point of contention in the 1970s, as some did not think that older television and radio stations should bow to the pleasure and superficiality of the average viewers. It was thought that they should continue focusing on issues such as education, culture, politics etc. These had been the main staple of those stations. However, the competition to TROS proved stronger in principle than in practice.

In 1988, the station made a first attempt at commercialising its business. In 2004, TROS celebrated its 40th anniversary.

The TROS publishes two television guides: Tros Kompas and TV-krant.
