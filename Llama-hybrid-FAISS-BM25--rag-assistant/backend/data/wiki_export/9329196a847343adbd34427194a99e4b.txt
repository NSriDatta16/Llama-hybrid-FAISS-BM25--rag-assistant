Same Place the Fly Got Smashed is the fourth album by American indie rock band Guided by Voices. 

In James Greer's book, Guided by Voices: A Brief History: Twenty-One Years of Hunting Accidents in the Forests of Rock and Roll, band leader Robert Pollard cites this album as having some of his best songs, describing "Pendulum" as "my favorite lyrics I've ever written."

Lyrics and music 
The sample "You brought me down, you and your family. I did not!" used at the beginning of "Airshow '88" came from the movie Shattered Dreams. The made-for-TV movie came out in 1990, which starred Lindsay Wagner. Frontman Robert Pollard describes the release as "a concept album [with] a linear story" about an alcoholic who commits a murder and is eventually executed for his crime. Same Place the Fly Got Smashed continues the beginning of the band's lo-fi era, featuring a production value markedly less crisp and clear than their previous releases.
