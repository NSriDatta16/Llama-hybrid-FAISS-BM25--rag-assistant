St. Fintan's Cemetery is located in Sutton, on the south side of Carrickbrack Road in Dublin, Ireland. It is in several sections: original with a ruined keeper's cottage and the remnants of old St. Fintan's Church, 1889, 1907 and 1954 extensions, and St. Fintan's Lawn Cemetery divided to St. Marnoc's, St. Assam's, St. Barroc's, St. Nessan's a St. Polan's. Just beyond the older portion is the still-flowing, still-visited St. Fintan's Holy Well.
