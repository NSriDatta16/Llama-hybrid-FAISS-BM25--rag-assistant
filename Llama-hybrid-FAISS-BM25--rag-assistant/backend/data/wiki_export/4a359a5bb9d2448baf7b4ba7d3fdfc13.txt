Maslak is a neighbourhood in the municipality and district of Sarıyer, Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its population is 12,260 (2022). It is one of the main business districts of Istanbul, located on the European side of the city. It was formerly an exclave of the municipality of Şişli, though being far north and actually closer to the municipalities of Sarıyer and Beşiktaş. In 2012, the jurisdiction of the Maslak district was shifted from Şişli to Sarıyer.

Maslak is in direct competition with the nearby Levent business district for new skyscraper projects. At the present, the tallest completed skyscraper in Maslak is the 47-floor Spine Tower which reaches a structural height of 202 meters; while the tallest skyscraper currently under construction in Maslak (as well as Istanbul and the rest of Turkey) is the Diamond of Istanbul, which comprises three centrally-connected towers, the tallest of which will have 53 floors above ground and will reach a structural height of 270 meters (thus surpassing the current tallest completed skyscraper in Istanbul, the 54-floor, 261 meters tall Istanbul Sapphire in the nearby Levent business district.) The Diamond of Istanbul will also be the first steel skyscraper in Turkey, where (as opposed to the situation in the United States) constructing with steel costs more than constructing with concrete. The reason for choosing steel was its relative strength in resisting earthquakes (Istanbul is located along the North Anatolian Fault), whereas concrete is more fire-resistant.

The stations İTÜ-Ayazağa and Atatürk Oto Sanayi of the M2 line of the Istanbul Metro serve the Maslak business district and its surrounding neighborhoods.
