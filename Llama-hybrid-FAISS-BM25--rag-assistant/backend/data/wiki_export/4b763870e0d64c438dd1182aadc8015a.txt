The 1995 Pan American Games were held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, from March 12 to March 26, 1995. After 44 years, this was the Pan American Games' first return to the country that hosted the first Games, in 1951.

Overview
The seaside resort city of Mar del Plata hosted the XII Pan American Games. The city of 600,000 is located 400 km south of Buenos Aires. Welcoming 5,144 athletes from 42 countries of PASO community, events were held in 34 different sports. The Games were held early by Northern Hemisphere standards, but at the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

Organizers spread the 1995 games throughout Argentina, including Buenos Aires, Parana, and Mar del Plata.

Bidding process 

Only Mar del Plata submitted a bid to host the 1995 Pan American Games that was recognized by the Pan American Sports Organization (OPEPA). Honoring an agreement that was made after Mar del Plata withdrew their bid for the 1991 Pan American Games, ODEPA selected Mar del Plata as the host city for the 1995 games at their General Assembly in Havana, Cuba in October 1989.
