Eurosport News was the first 24-hour international Europe-based sports news channel part of the European sports network Eurosport, owned by Discovery Inc. It was available in 11 million homes in 54 countries.

History
The channel launched on 1 September 2000 and quietly closed down on 1 January 2018. It featured live scores, highlights, most recent breaking news and commentaries with recorded voiceovers, similar to Euronews. Eurosport News' sportscasts were broadcast around the clock in 15-minute blocks with frequent updates. The service combined video, text and graphics with the screen being divided into 4 sections. A video section that displayed highlights and news bulletins, a breaking news ticker at the bottom and a scoring section that gave in-depth analysis of results and game stats.
