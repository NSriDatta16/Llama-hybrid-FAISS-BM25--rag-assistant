Personal life
In 2006, Viers was charged for threatening to beat up a man who was dating his estranged wife. Explaining that he was "under the influence of love," he pleaded no contest to the charge and was found guilty and fined.

In 2010, he sued the City of Myrtle Beach in the State Supreme Court over a law requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets within the city limits, which he regarded as unconstitutional.

Sexual harassment
In January 2012, Viers was arrested on charges of harassing a 28-year-old woman described as an ex-girlfriend. He was released on a $5000 bond and subsequently withdrew his bid for the GOP nomination to the U.S. Congress from South Carolina's 7th congressional district, citing "personal reasons".

Money laundering
In August 2014, Viers was indicted by a federal grand jury on fourteen felony charges including money laundering and making false statements to an IRS criminal investigator. Viers pleaded guilty to money laundering in April 2015 in a plea deal that dismissed his other charges. On October 20, 2015, Viers was sentenced to 37 months in prison and ordered to pay $875,000.

Viers was disbarred by the South Carolina Supreme Court in July 2016.  In January 2017, Viers was released to a halfway house, according to prison officials.
