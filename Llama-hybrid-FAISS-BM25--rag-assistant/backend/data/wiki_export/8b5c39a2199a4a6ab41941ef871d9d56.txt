History

By a Papal Brief dated 19 May 1882, Pope Leo XIII created the Diocese of Portsmouth. It was formed out of the western portion of the Diocese of Southwark, as constituted at the re-establishment of the hierarchy in 1850. The Southwark diocese had become too large for one bishop, extending as it did from London to Bournemouth and from the outskirts of Oxford to Dover and including the Channel Islands.

The new diocese comprised the counties of Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Berkshire, and the Channel Islands. It was thus almost co-terminous with the limits of the (Anglican) Diocese of Winchester. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The Ecclesiastical Titles Act forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an Anglican see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at Southampton, with St Joseph Church in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of Portsmouth had begun, and it was decided to make it the future cathedral of the diocese.

Bishop Vertue was succeeded by his vicar-general John Cahill. During Cahill's tenure a number of religious orders established houses in the diocese. In 1901 Benedictines from Solesmes Abbey settled on the Isle of Wight. Benedictine nuns established St Cecilia's Abbey, Ryde. Benedictine monks from the monastery of St. Edmund's, in Douai, France, came to Upper Woolhampton and founded Douai Abbey in 1903 when the community left France as a result of anti-clerical legislation.

Bishops

John Vertue (1826–1900) was appointed the first bishop of the new diocese. He was consecrated by Cardinal Manning on 25 July 1882 and on 10 August of that year opened the Cathedral of St John the Evangelist at Portsmouth. When the new bishop took possession of his see, he had about seventy priests and forty missions.

Since 1900 the diocese has had seven bishops: John Cahill, 1900–1910; William Cotter (who came from Cloyne in Co. Cork), 1910–1940; John Henry King (who was given the personal title of archbishop in 1954), 1941–1965; Derek Worlock (translated to Liverpool as Archbishop 7 February 1976), 1965–1976; Anthony Emery, 1976–1988; Crispian Hollis, 1988–2012; Philip Egan, 2012-.

On 11 July 2012, Egan's appointment as the eighth Bishop of Portsmouth was announced in an official press release from the Vatican Information Service (VIS), an arm of the Holy See Press Office.

Bishop Egan's Episcopal Ordination took place at St John's Cathedral, Portsmouth, on Monday 24 September 2012, the Feast of Our Lady of Walsingham.
