"Do What's Good for Me" is a song Belgian-Dutch Eurodance band 2 Unlimited, released in October 1995 via Byte and ZYX Records as the first single from the band's first greatest hits compilation album, Hits Unlimited (1995). Co-written by bandmembers Anita Dels and Ray Slijngaard, the song was a hit in Europe, reaching the top 10 in Finland and Spain. Its music video was directed by Nigel Simpkiss.

Critical reception
Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "The ongoing wave of pop-NRG dance acts enjoying radio prominence owes a massive debt to this ever-hot European duo for getting the party started. Sadly, the act has yet to achieve U.S. success Ã  la such offspring as Real McCoy, but this jumpy li'l jam could easily change that. The bassline throbs infectiously, while the interplay of male rapping and female singing pops with palpable chemistry." Ross Jones from The Guardian deemed it "a powerhouse anthem of self-discovery, robo-bass, and skipping beats". A reviewer from Music Week gave the song three out of five, adding that "Anita and Ray go for a harder-edged techno sound, resulting in a less radio-friendly track than many of their recent releases." James Hamilton from the RM Dance Update called it a "synth stabbed squawker".

Chart performance
"Do What's God for Me" peaked at number three in both Finland and Spain while entering the top 20 in Belgium (Flanders and Wallonia), Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In the latter, it peaked at number 16 during its first week at the UK Singles Chart. Additionally, the single was a top-30 hit in Austria and a top-40 hit in Sweden. In Australia, it reached number 87. On both the Eurochart Hot 100 and the European Dance Radio Chart, "Do What's Good for Me" peaked at number 13 in November 1995.

Music video
The accompanying music video for "Do What's Good For Me" was directed by director Nigel Simpkiss and released in the UK in October 1995. It features Anita and Ray performing the song in a computer, on what appears to be a website. Simpkiss had previously directed the videos for "Let the Beat Control Your Body", "The Real Thing", "Here I Go" and "Nothing Like the Rain".
