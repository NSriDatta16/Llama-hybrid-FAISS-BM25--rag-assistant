Olympic career 
Al-Deehani won a bronze medal for the men's double trap shooting event at the 2000 Summer Olympics and thus he became the first Kuwaiti to ever win an Olympic bronze medal. He won another bronze for the men's Olympic trap shooting event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Al-Deehani competed as an "independent Olympic athlete" because Kuwait was banned from the Olympics by the IOC. Al-Deehani called for the resignation of Kuwaiti officials responsible for the IOC ban, but refused to carry the Olympic flag in the 2016 Olympic opening ceremonies. Al-Deehani defeated Italian Marco Innocenti in the gold medal match of the men's double trap, becoming the first independent athlete and Kuwaiti to win a gold medal. He said the medal is the best answer to those who kept the Kuwait flag away from the award ceremonies He added that everyone was calling him “Fehaid the Kuwaiti”. This medal, he added, would carry the name of Kuwait. “I was not representing the Olympic Committee; rather I represented Kuwait.”
