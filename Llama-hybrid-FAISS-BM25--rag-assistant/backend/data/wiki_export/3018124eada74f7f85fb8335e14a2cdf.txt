Beall was born in 1769 in Frederick County in the Province of Maryland (in the portion of which would be later separated as Montgomery County in 1776), and his family moved to Washington County, Pennsylvania during his youth.

He married Rebecca Johnson ca. 1792. In about 1801, he and his family moved to Ohio, settling initially at Steubenville. He later moved from Jefferson County to New Lisbon, in Columbiana County, Ohio.

Military career
In 1790, Beall joined the military and participated in the Northwest Indian War in the Ohio Valley. He was on General Anthony Wayne's staff where he became acquainted with then Captain William Henry Harrison.

In Columbiana County, Ohio, he became a Colonel of the Militia.

During the War of 1812, he served as Brigadier General 2d Brigade Ohio Militia. He led several brigades from Eastern Ohio into the area of present Richland County, Ohio. He established one of his headquarters (Camp Christmas) at Wooster, Wayne County, Ohio.

Political career

He was a Whig Presidential elector in 1840 for Harrison/Tyler.

Legacy
Beall's home in Wooster still stands and at one time was owned by the College of Wooster. The college used it as a woman's dormitory. The home was under the care of William Foard and his wife Winona (Houser) Foard who lived in the upper stories from about 1958 to about 1973. The home is now the center of the [Wayne County Historical Society of Ohio] campus.
