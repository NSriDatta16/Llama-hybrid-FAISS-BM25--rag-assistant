The soundtrack to Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones was released by Sony Classical on April 23, 2002. The music was composed and conducted by John Williams, and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices in January 2002, with orchestrations provided by Conrad Pope and Eddie Karam. Shawn Murphy recorded and mixed the score. Peter Myles and Kenneth Wannberg served as music editors. Williams himself produced the recording sessions.

The album had four alternate covers, each sold separately, that featured Anakin and Padme, Jango Fett, Yoda, and the theatrical poster art by Drew Struzan. For a limited time, the CD shipped with a bonus CD-ROM featuring a PC screensaver and a total of four alternative covers (each sold separately). A Target-exclusive edition featured the bonus track "On the Conveyor Belt". A remastered version of the soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on May 4, 2018.

Track listing

For the US release, early album prints titled track 2 as only "Love Theme from Attack of the Clones" on the album's back and insert. Later releases re-named the track to "Across the Stars (Love Theme from Attack of the Clones)". This was not the case for the international versions.

The bonus track, "On the Conveyor Belt", is not included on the 2018 release by Walt Disney Records.

Recording Information
Certain cues used in the film contain inserts that replace a portion of the intended cue. Both the Main Title and End Credit introduction recordings were taken from The Phantom Menace. Due to the editing in the film, several effects were used to aid in transitions between edited cues. Several moments use a chime sound such as the transition from the Obi-Wan Kamino moments to the Anakin/Padmé Naboo scenes. "Entrance of the Monsters", for example, is almost completely tracked out and is instead replaced with "source" crowd sounds such as drums. Once the Battle of Geonosis begins, the editing becomes extensive, pulling from both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, utilizing all forms of editing and supplementing transitions with timpani rolls. The complete score with the inserts and edits has never been officially released.
