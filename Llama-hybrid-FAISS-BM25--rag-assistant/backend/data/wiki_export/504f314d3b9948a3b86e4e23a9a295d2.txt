Stance Punks are a Japanese punk rock band, formed in 1998. The band gained fame through their performances at a rooftop live-venue in Shimokitazawa.

Stance Punks' name spread overseas when their song "Mayonaka Shounen Totsugekidan" was used as the ending theme song for the movie Battle Royale 2. Their song "No Boy No Cry" has been used as the opening theme song for the anime Naruto and the song "I Wanna Be" was used as the ending theme song for the anime Soul Eater. As of 2005, the band has signed with Sony Epic's label called "Kowalski Records" under which the single "Mony Mony Mony" was released.

Critics often cite similarities between them and The Blue Hearts, an immensely popular punk band with a very similar style of music. 

The band recently performed a five-hour long "Naruto Tribute" broadcast from a popular Kyoto radio station.

On January 3, 2021, the band announced the departure of Katsuda Kinya, guitarist and founding member of Stance Punks since 1998.

Band members include:
Tsuru (Vocals)
Katsuda Kinya (Guitar)
Tetsushi Kawasaki (Bassist)
Satou Koh (Drums)
