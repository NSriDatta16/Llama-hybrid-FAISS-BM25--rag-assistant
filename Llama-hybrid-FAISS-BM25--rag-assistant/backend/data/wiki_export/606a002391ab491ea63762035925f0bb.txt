History

Early years
KINE-FM signed on the air in .  It was owned by RLS Radio with studios on Bishop Street.  It started with a classic hits format, which changed to classic rock by the early 1990s.

It switched to a Traditional Hawaiian Adult Contemporary format in 1992 to compete against Hawaiian Top 40 100.3 KCCN-FM.  KINE-FM was later purchased by then KCCN-FM owner B.J. Glascock and the two became sister stations in 1993.  KCCN-FM aims at younger Hawaiian listeners while KINE-FM aims a bit older.

KINE target 25-54 listeners of Hawaiian descent, done in an adult-appeal presentation.  It plays Hawaiian songs from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This direction distinguishes KINE-FM from co-owned KCCN-FM, which plays more youthful Top 40/CHR-style Hawaiian music.  For many years, KINE-FM was co-owned with KKNE 940 AM, which aimed at 35-64 listeners and played older Traditional Hawaiian hits.  KKNE went silent in December 2022.
