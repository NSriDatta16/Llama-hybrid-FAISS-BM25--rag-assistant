Lotería (Spanish word meaning "lottery") is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo,and is played on a deck of cards instead of numbered ping pong balls. Every image has a name and an assigned number, but the number is usually ignored. Each player has at least one , a board with a randomly created 4 x 4 grid of pictures with their corresponding name and number. Players choose a tabla (Spanish word for "board") to play with, from a variety of previously created , each with a different selection of images.

The traditional Lotería card deck is composed of a set of 54 different cards, each with a different picture. To start the game, the caller (cantor, Spanish for "singer") shuffles the deck. One by one, the caller picks a card from the deck and announces it to the players by its name, sometimes using a verse before reading the card name. Each player locates the matching pictogram of the card just announced on their board and marks it off with a chip or other kind of marker. In Mexico, it is traditional to use small rocks, crown corks or pinto beans as markers. The winner is the first player that shouts "" or "" right after completing a  or a previous agreed pattern, similar to bingo: row, column, diagonal, four corners, or unique to this game, or four in a square (a ')'.

This can be seen with the card of  (Spanish for "the soldier") which was used as a symbol to reference war as a part of Mexico's national identity during that time. Many of the pictures used in Don Clemente's  resemble the Major Arcana of Tarot cards used for divination (which, in turn, are based on cards used in Tarot card games). Other popular  sets are ,  and .

 Alternative versions  is a variant version of the traditional Mexican , where the basic rules apply. For this version, before the game begins, players agree on how many  are to be completed in a row, column or diagonal pattern. A  is a group of images in a square. The square may contain 2 x 2 (4) or 3 x 3 (9) images for a traditional .

During the 1930s, the Roman Catholic church devised its own version of , most likely because of the connections between Don Clemente's popular images and Tarot cards; divination and fortune-telling are prohibited by Catholic doctrine. This alternative  deck consisted of Catholic images instead of the traditional images used in the original game, likely allowing devout Catholics a way to enjoy the game without those "sinful" connotations and giving the Church a way to teach its beliefs by way of the .
