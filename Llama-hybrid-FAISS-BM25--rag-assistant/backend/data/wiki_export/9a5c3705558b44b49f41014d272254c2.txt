The Wichita Stealth was an arena football team. They played their home games at the Kansas Coliseum in Wichita, Kansas.  They originally began play in the original incarnation of the Indoor Football League as a 2000 expansion team known as the Wichita Warlords before the league folded, in which they moved to the AF2 and became the Stealth. They only got to the playoffs once during their five-year existence, where they had an early exit (courtesy of the Hawaiian Islanders).  After an 8-8 season in 2004, the team officially disbanded and ceased all operations. After Intrust Bank Arena opened, there were rumors that the Stealth might be reincarnated, but the talks died down, and nothing ever surfaced. Now the Wichita Force of Champions Indoor Football, play there.
