Hein van de Geyn (born 18 July 1956) is a jazz double bassist, composer and band leader from the Netherlands. Van de Geyn also teaches double bass and music.

Early life
Hein van de Geyn was born in Schijndel, Netherlands on 18 July 1956. He studied classical violin for 15 years and started on electric bass guitar when a teenager. He studied classical music at a Tilburg conservatory from 1974 to 1979, and then jazz double bass at a Rotterdam conservatory until 1980.

Career
He lived and worked in Seattle in 1980 and San Francisco the following year. He returned to Europe in 1983. He began playing with Philip Catherine in 1985. Van de Geyn toured with Chet Baker between 1985 and 1988, including Japan in 1987. Another multi-year association was with Dee Dee Bridgewater (1988–96). In 1990 he recorded with Lee Konitz; the two also played as a duo during the following two years. In 1994 he formed the band Baseline with John Abercrombie and Joe LaBarbera.

Also in 1994, Van de Geyn co-founded the jazz label Challenge Records, for which he was in charge of artists and repertoire. Challenge Jazz was spun out from the parent and has been owned since 2005 by Hein van de Geyn. In 2019 the label was acquired by Wigt International that released the catalogue under the name Baseline Jazz Records.

In 1996 he became head of the bass section in the jazz department of the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.
