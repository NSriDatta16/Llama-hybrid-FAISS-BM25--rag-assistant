Flakstad Church is located about  northeast of Ramberg.  It is the second church building to exist on this site since 1430. The timber used for the church comes from Russia—the people of Flakstad exchanged fish for timber during the period of Pomor trade at that time. This is why the steeple has a Russian Orthodox look.
