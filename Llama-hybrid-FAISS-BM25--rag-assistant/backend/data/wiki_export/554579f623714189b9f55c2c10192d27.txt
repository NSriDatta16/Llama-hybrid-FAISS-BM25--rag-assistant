Remseck am Neckar () is a town in the district of Ludwigsburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated at the confluence of the rivers Rems and Neckar, about 12 km northeast of Stuttgart, and 7 km southeast of Ludwigsburg. 
The town was formed on January 1, 1975, initially under the name Aldingen am Neckar. In 1977, it received the name Remseck am Neckar and has had the status of a Große Kreisstadt since January 1, 2004.

History
Five of the six boroughs of Remseck used to be villages and were founded several hundred years ago. References to Aldingen and Hochdorf can be found as early as 1100, Hochberg is mentioned in a text from 1231 whereas Neckargröningen is already referred to in 806. Neckarrems is also mentioned in 1268 as „Rems“; the „Neckar“ was added only in the 17th century.

Hochdorf, Hochberg, and Neckarrems used to belong to Waiblingen, whereas Aldingen und Neckargröningen belonged to Ludwigsburg. In 1938 however, all five boroughs were assigned to Ludwigsburg.

Today’s Remseck am Neckar was founded on January 1, 1975, by amalgamation of the communities Aldingen, Hochberg, Hochdorf, Neckargröningen und Neckarrems and was initially named “Gemeinde Aldingen am Neckar”, but renamed on July 1, 1977. The town’s new name “Remseck” was chosen due to a castle, which used to be located on a mountain at the confluence of the rivers Rems and Neckar. The “Castle Remseck” was built in 1842 at exactly the same place, further verifying the name “Remseck”.

In 1992, Pattonville, a former residential area which was founded in 1955 and was predominantly inhabited by US Americans, joined Remseck, but was split in two parts: The eastern part belongs to Remseck, the western part belongs to Kornwestheim.

In 1999, the population exceeded 20,000, which is the minimal limit of inhabitants a town has to have to become a city. The town government applied for town privileges in 2003 and obtained city rights on January 1, 2004.
