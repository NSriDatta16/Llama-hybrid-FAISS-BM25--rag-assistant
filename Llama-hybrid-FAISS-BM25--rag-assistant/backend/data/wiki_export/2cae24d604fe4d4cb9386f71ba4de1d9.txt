He was appointed by Woodrow Wilson as judge of the territorial United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on May 15, 1916.

Vaughan was a political supporter of Woodrow Wilson and advocated states to pass prohibition, which he opposed at a national level because he believed that it would violate states rights.
