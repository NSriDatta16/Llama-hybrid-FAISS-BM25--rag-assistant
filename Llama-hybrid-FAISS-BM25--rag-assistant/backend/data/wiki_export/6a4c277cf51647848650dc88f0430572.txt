St. Boniface's Abbey () is a Benedictine monastery in Maxvorstadt, Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It was founded in 1835 by King Ludwig I of Bavaria, as a part of his efforts to reanimate the country's spiritual life by the restoration of the monasteries destroyed during the secularisation of the early 19th century.

The abbey, constructed in Byzantine style, was formally dedicated in 1850. It was destroyed during World War II and only partly restored. The church contains the tombs of King Ludwig I and of his queen, Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

St. Boniface's is situated in a city, which is unusual for a Benedictine monastery. To ensure the material provision of the monks, King Ludwig bought the former Andechs Abbey, which had been secularised in 1803, along with its supporting farmlands and gave it to the new abbey. For this reason Andechs is now a priory of St. Boniface's Abbey.

The monks work in the pastoral care of the parish, in scholarly and educational fields and in the care of the homeless. The present abbot (as of 2014) is Johannes Eckert, whom the monks elected on 23 July 2003 on the retirement of the previous abbot, Odilo Lechner.

St. Boniface's Abbey is a member of the Bavarian Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation.
