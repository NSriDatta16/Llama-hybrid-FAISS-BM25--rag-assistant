Sheldon ISD covers 53.5 square miles and serves several neighborhoods in the Sheldon Lake area. Administration for the district is headquartered in the Dr. Donald Ney Administration Complex with Dr. King Davis acting as superintendent. Since the early 2000s, strong enrollment growth has driven new construction and expansions throughout the district. Nearly 7,800 students are enrolled in 2015.

The district and all of its schools were rated as having "Met Standard" in 2014 under the new Texas Education Agency accountability ratings.

History
The Sheldon Independent School District became an independent school district in 1952.

District Growth
Sheldon ISD is the largest growing out of all ten counties in the Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown metropolitan area. From 2000 to 2010, district enrollment grew 61.5% and has annually averaged three to five percent growth since 2005. Annual enrollment growth rate change for the 2008–09 and 2009-10 school years was 6.8% and 5.9% respectively.

The construction of two major highways, US 90 (Crosby Freeway), and the Sam Houston Tollway, have been major drivers for growth. With easier access to the area, the district is expected to continue growing as new homes are built.
