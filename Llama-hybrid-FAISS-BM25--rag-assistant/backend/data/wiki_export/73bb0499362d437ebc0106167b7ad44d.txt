Haybridge High School and Sixth Form is an 11–18 mixed academy school with approximately 1,250 students (420 in the sixth form) in Hagley, Stourbridge, England, United Kingdom, serving North West Worcestershire, the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, and South Staffordshire. The school is a Technology College, with the two additional specialisms of Applied Learning and Sports. It is also a Training School and a Leading Edge School.

History
The school was built on a greenfield site and opened in 1976 with approximately 10 students. At the beginning of the 2004–2005 school term Haybridge (at the time a 13–18 high school) merged with Hagley Middle School (a 9–13 middle school) and became an 11–18 secondary school, as part of the move across the local region from a three- to two-tier system. Hagley Middle School was served by a number of smaller first schools; these first schools have now been made primary schools to serve Haybridge. Initially the one high school was still located on two sites, until September 2007 when both halves of Haybridge moved to the one campus on Brake Lane. To accommodate the extra students an expansion of the existing buildings was undertaken.

Present day
An Ofsted report of December 2008 awarded the school a Grade 1 (outstanding in all aspects), stating that the school is nationally among the top 10%.
The school has consistently been one of the highest performing state schools in Worcestershire at GCSE age (2004 data).

Haybridge Academy is part of a Worcestershire organisation called ContinU, a trust that creates more courses for students attending secondary and high schools in the Wyre Forest and Hagley area.
Haybridge is currently working with:
 Baxter College, Business and Enterprise
 The Bewdley School
 Hagley RC High School
 King Charles I School
 Stourminster and Blakebrook Special Needs Schools

 Wolverley CE Secondary School
