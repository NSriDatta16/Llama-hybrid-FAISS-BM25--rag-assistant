Career
Schullstrom was drafted out of high school by the Toronto Blue Jays 620th overall in the 24th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft. Deciding not to sign, he would have to wait until 1990 to be drafted again, where he was selected 51st overall in the 2nd round of the 1990 draft by the Baltimore Orioles.

In the minors, Schullstrom spent time starting and relieving. Perhaps his best minor league season as a starter was in 1991, where he went 5–6 with a 3.05 ERA and 93 K's in 85+ innings. His best season as a reliever in the minors was 1994 with Nashville, when he had a 2.63 ERA in 26 games, and 43 strikeouts in 41 innings.

Schullstrom was traded twice by the Orioles within a span of a year. He was first dealt to the Padres for Craig Lefferts on August 31, 1992 in a deal which was completed four days later on September 4 when Ricky Gutiérrez joined him in San Diego. He was claimed off waivers on April 2, 1993 by the Orioles who sent him to the Twins 4 months later on August 16 to complete a transaction from the previous day in which Mike Pagliarulo went to Baltimore.

On July 18, 1994, Schullstrom made his Major League debut as a 25-year-old rookie for the Twins. In nine games that year, he posted an ERA of 2.77 and had 13 strikeouts in 13 innings of work. His success did not carry over to the next season-in 37 games in 1995, he had a 6.89 ERA.

In the field, he committed only one error in his career for a .889 fielding percentage.

On September 27, 1995, Schullstrom played his final Major League game. Even though this was the end to his majors career, he played four seasons in Japan, two for the Nippon-Ham Fighters in 1998 and 1999, and two for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp in 2001 and 2002.

Schullstrom is currently the Director of Scouting-USA for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of the Nippon Professional Baseball League.
