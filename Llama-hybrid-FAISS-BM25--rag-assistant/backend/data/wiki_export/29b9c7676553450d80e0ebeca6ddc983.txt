Skull Mountain is an enclosed roller coaster located at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey. Designed and manufactured by Intamin, the ride opened to the public on June 3, 1996.

Ride experience
After ascending the first lift hill, the train travels around the front facade of the enclosure to ascend the second lift hill. The first drop is the ride's only steep drop, while the rest of the ride contains three horizontal helices.

The building is punctuated by strobe lights and sound effects play over a tribal or heavy metal music score. 
Occasionally, ride operators will operate Skull Mountain with the interior lights illuminated. On hot summer days, the park turns on the ride's exterior waterfall, which falls from the exterior skull's eyes. It pours down into the water below, wetting guests in the ride's queue.

While most of the park's coasters (except Kingda Ka) will operate in light rain, Skull Mountain remains open during thunderstorms, since it is enclosed. It will be closed only if the thunderstorm is severe.

A flume boat ride of a similar name, Skull Mountain at Six Flags America near Baltimore, Maryland, closed in July 2011 to make room for Apocalypse, later known as Firebird.
