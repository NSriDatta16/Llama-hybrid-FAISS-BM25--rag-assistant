Streets of Bollywood is a compilation album of songs from Bollywood movies, remixed by British Asian music artists. Among the artists are Hunterz, Metz & Trix, and Kami K (who produced the most tracks, at 3, plus two re-remixes at the end of the album). Several of the artists would also feature on the later similarly themed Bollywood Breaks Vol. 1.

The remixing of the songs consisted of new beats and backing music, as well as adding rapping in English interspersed with the original Hindi lyrics.
