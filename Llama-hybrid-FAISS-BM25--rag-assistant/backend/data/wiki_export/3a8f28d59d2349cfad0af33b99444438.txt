Upland High School is a four-year public high school located in the city of Upland, California. The school was established in 1955 as part of the Chaffey Joint Union High School District, and since 1988 it has been a member of the Upland Unified School District. It currently serves students from Upland and the northern portions of Ontario and Montclair that are above the San Bernardino Freeway.

History
Just prior to the City of Upland's growth spurt in the 1960s, Upland High School was established in 1955. By the 1980s this population growth had the side-effect of overcrowding, which in turn caused students to transfer to other high schools in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District. The affected families then began a movement towards unifying Upland High School with the existing elementary and middle schools of the Upland School District. Superintendent George Renworth promoted this movement and the Upland Unified School District was established in 1986. Upland High School has been a part of the district since it left the Chaffey Joint Union High School District in 1988. The school offers many classes, electives, and sports. Auto, Graphic Arts, Art, Photo, Cooking, Choir, Marching Band, Colorguard and Ceramics are just a fraction of the extra classes available. For more advanced students, the school offers a wide variety of Advanced Placement and honors courses. In addition, there are many sports available to the students, including Volleyball, Football, Baseball, Softball, Basketball, Tennis, Water Polo, Cheerleading, Wrestling, Track & Field, Cross Country, Soccer, and Swimming. The main quad area has been renovated, along with the football field and pool to offer a better environment at Upland High School. A bond passed by the community has allowed for "Twenty-First Century Classrooms," a series of renovations which include skylights, smart boards, and class sets of laptops.
