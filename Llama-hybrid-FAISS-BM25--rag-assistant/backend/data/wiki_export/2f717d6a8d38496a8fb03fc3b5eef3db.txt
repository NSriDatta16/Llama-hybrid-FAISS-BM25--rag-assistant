Professional career

Pittsburgh Steelers
Bishop was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers after the 1958 NFL Draft on January 29. He was tried at split end and as a halfback, catching only 3 passes in his rookie season. In his second year, he was used at defensive halfback and punt returner, but was released after 2 games on October 12, because of poor performances.

Chicago Bears
The Chicago Bears claimed him off waivers during the 1959 season, but played him in only one game.

Dallas Cowboys
On September 6, 1960, the expansion Dallas Cowboys claimed him off waivers. Bishop was switched to cornerback and during the Cowboys' 1960 inaugural year, he became the franchise first starting right cornerback, registering 71 tackles, 13 passes defensed and 3 interceptions in a 12-game season, tying him with Tom Franckhauser for the team lead.

In 1961, he began to stand out, finishing with 8 interceptions in a 14-game season, including 6 in the first five contests. He trailed league leader Dick Lynch by one. Only Everson Walls (twice) and Mel Renfro (once), have had more interceptions in a season for the Cowboys. He also established a team record that still stands today, with five consecutive games with an interception. Bishop did not make the Pro Bowl, but was named to the Sporting News first-team All-NFL team.

In 1962, he had 6 interceptions and also scored his lone career touchdown, returning an interception 84 yards in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams. After missing the Pro Bowl the previous season, Bishop was one of the first Cowboys players ever to receive this honor. In the Pro Bowl, he recovered an Abe Woodson kickoff fumble, returning it 20 yards untouched for the final score in a 30-20 win.

In 1963, he recorded 5 interceptions, making him the Cowboys leader in interceptions during their first four years of existence. He suffered a knee injury in the sixth game against the New York Giants.

The knee injury forced him to have surgery before the 1964 season, which would limit him the rest of his career. He started 7 games at right cornerback, while alternating with Warren Livingston. 

In 1965, he was a backup behind Livingston. He retired at the end of the 1966 season.

Bishop played 9 seasons in the NFL, leaving as the Cowboys career interceptions leader. His 22 interceptions rank eleventh on the current franchise career interceptions list. Although he played on some of the Cowboys worst teams, he became one of their original defensive stars.

Personal life
Bishop at one point worked as a morticians' assistant during the off-season.
