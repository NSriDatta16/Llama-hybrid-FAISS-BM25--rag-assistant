The Xenophobe's Guide books are a series of short books published by Oval Books that aim to give the reader the most important information about a country or region in a humorous way. They briefly describe its culture and history and something of the values held by its people under headings like "Business", "Language", etc.

Reception 
Jo Myers of the Evening Standard described the series as "quick to read, lighthearted and entertaining". In a review of the French guide, the English writer Lorna Sage called it "short, aphoristic, seriously funny, not that xenophobic and almost entirely apt".

The Scots guide, written by David Ross, was controversially received for its jokes about Scottish people, including one that alleged poor hygiene. Alex Salmond, then the leader of the Scottish National Party, criticised it as "a few gags short of the full joke", and historian Tom Devine found it too extreme. Others worried that the book would depict Scotland as an undesirable place. Ross defended the jokes and said that he was trying to "pinpoint what it is to be Scottish".
