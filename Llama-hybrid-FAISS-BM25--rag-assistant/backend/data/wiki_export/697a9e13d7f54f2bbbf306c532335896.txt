The superior thoracic artery (highest thoracic artery) is a small artery located near the armpit. It usually arises from (the first division of) the axillary artery, but may sometimes instead arise from the thoracoacromial artery (itself a branch of the second division of the axillary artery). It supplies the pectoralis minor and major muscles, and the chest wall.

Anatomy

Course and relations 
It passes anteromedially along medial upper border of the pectoralis before passing between pectoralis minor and pectoralis major to reach the chest wall.

Anastomoses 
It forms anastomoses with the internal thoracic artery, and upper intercostal arteries.
