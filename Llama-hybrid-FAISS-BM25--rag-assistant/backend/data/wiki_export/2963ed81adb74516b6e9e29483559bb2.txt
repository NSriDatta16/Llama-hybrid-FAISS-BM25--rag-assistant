The Curtiss F6C Hawk was a late 1920s American naval biplane fighter aircraft. It was part of the long line of Curtiss Hawk airplanes built by the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company for the American military.

Originally designed for land-based use, the Model 34C was virtually identical to the P-1 Hawk in United States Army Air Corps service. The United States Navy ordered nine, but starting with the sixth example, they were  strengthened for carrier-borne operations and redesignated Model 34D. Flown from the carriers  and  from 1927â€“30, most of the later variants passed to Marine fighter-bomber units, while a few were flown for a time as twin-float floatplanes.

Operators

 VF-9M (US Marines) operated 5 Model 34C, F6C-1 and XF6C-4 from land bases.
 VF-2 (US Navy) operated 4 Model 34D, F6C-2 from 
 VF-5S, later renamed VF-1B (US Navy) along with VF-8M (US Marines) operated 35 Model 34E, F6C-3 from 
 VF-2B (US Navy) operated 31 Model 34H, F6C-4 from Langley
