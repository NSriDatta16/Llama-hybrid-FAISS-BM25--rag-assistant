Judith Mary Berrisford (1921â€“2008) was a British writer of children's pony stories which are very similar to those of the Pullein-Thompson sisters, as well as other animal story and books on gardening. 

Berrisford was born in Fenton, Staffordshire in 1921. She also wrote under the name Amanda Hope.

Berrisford married Clifford Lewis in 1945, with whom she wrote under the name Judith M. Berrisford. As of 1974, Berrisford was living in Deganwy, Wales, but moved to Ramsey, Isle of Man in 1976. She died there in 2008, at the age of 87.
