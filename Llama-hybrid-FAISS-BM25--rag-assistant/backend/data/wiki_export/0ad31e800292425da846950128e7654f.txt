Throughout its history of publications, Marvel Comics has produced many inter-company crossover stories combining characters from different series. The following is a list of crossover events involving superheroes and characters from other series.

Line-wide events 

Secret Wars was the first modern Marvel event where a separate limited series was launched, with other tie-ins following it. After its release, Marvel started having annual crossover events where a mini series was established for the event, which impacted most Marvel comic books.

1990s

The Infinity Trilogy is a three-event arc about the Infinity Gems. Part 2 (Infinity War) and Part 3 (Infinity Crusade) deal with the fallout of the Infinity Gauntlet: the creation of separate parts of cosmic hero Adam Warlock, Goddess, and Magus.
