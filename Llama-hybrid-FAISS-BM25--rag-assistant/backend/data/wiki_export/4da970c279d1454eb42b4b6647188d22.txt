Philip the Upright () (14 July 1448 – 28 February 1508) was an Elector Palatine of the Rhine from the house of Wittelsbach from 1476 to 1508.

Biography
He was the only son of Louis IV, Count Palatine of the Rhine and his wife Margaret of Savoy. At the age of one year Philip fell under the guardianship of his uncle Frederick, who later adopted him. In 1474, he married Margaret of Bavaria-Landshut, the daughter of Louis IX, Duke of Bavaria and by virtue of the marriage received the Upper Palatinate. After the death of his adoptive father in 1476, he became the Elector. In 1499 he inherited the possessions of the branches of Palatinate-Mosbach and Palatinate-Neumarkt. Philip lost the Landshut War of Succession in 1504 to Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria.

In 1481 Philip invited Johann von Dalberg into the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg.
