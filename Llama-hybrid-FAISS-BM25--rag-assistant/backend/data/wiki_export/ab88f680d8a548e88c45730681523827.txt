Adam Bomb (born Adam Brenner, 14 August 1963) is an American guitarist who worked with artists like TKO, Black 'N Blue, Steel Pulse, John Paul Jones, and Michael Monroe. His stage name is a play on the name Atom Bomb.

Early
In 1979, Adam Bomb and future Queensrÿche frontman Geoff Tate started a cover band called Tyrant. Later, Bomb joined the band TKO, with who he recorded the album In Your Face. In 1982, Bomb flew to LA and unsuccessfully auditioned for Kiss. He then moved to Hollywood and shared an apartment with Jeffrey Isbell (better known as Izzy Stradlin). He met neighbor, Tommy Thayer, a guitarist for the band Movie Star (which later evolved into Black N' Blue), who came up with the original idea that he should call his act 'Adam Bomb'. Movie Star opened for TKO at The Showbox in 1983. Adam recorded his first demos with producer Rick Keefer while playing gigs with Steeler as a replacement. One year later, Bomb recorded songs with drummer Chuck Ruff and bassist Cliff Williams of AC/DC, and finally finished his album Fatal Attraction.

The Adam Bomb Band

Bomb signed a management deal with Leber Krebs, and moved to NYC to start the Adam Bomb Band with former Billy Idol drummer Gregg Gerson, Billy Idol/Riot bassist Phil Feit, and Aerosmith guitarist Jimmy Crespo. They recorded Fatal Attraction in 1985. The band later moved again to Los Angeles, and for a time, opened for bands Armored Saint and Metallica.

The follow-up contained mainly left over material from their debut release, and so Pure S.E.X. (1989) had indifferent reviews.

2011
In 2011, Adam Bomb bassist Paul Del Bello and drummer Violet Cannibal had started recording on a CDs  Rock On, Rock Hard, Rock Animal. The album had cover songs as well as original material. Bomb recorded "Affection" (written by Little Steven), continued touring, and lived around Europe occasionally.  In July 2016, he recorded a single with drummer Bobby Reynolds, keyboardist Alan St Jon, saxophonist Arno Hecht, and Phil Feit.
