France

Paris

Musée d'Orsay

On the occasion of the Exposition Universelle of 1900, sculptor Frédéric Bartholdi crafted a  1/16 scale, 2.743 metre (nine-foot) version of his Liberty Enlightening the World. It was cast in 1889 and he subsequently gave it to the Musée du Luxembourg. In 1906, the statue was placed outside the museum in the Jardin du Luxembourg, where it stood for over a century, until 2011. Since 2012 it has stood within the entrance hall to the Musée d'Orsay, and a newly constructed bronze replica stands in its place in the Jardin du Luxembourg.

Île aux Cygnes

This statue was given in 1889 to France by U.S. citizens living in Paris to celebrate the French Revolution three years after the main statue in New York was inaugurated. Originally, the statue was turned towards the east in order to face the Eiffel Tower. In 1937 it was turned towards the west so that it would be facing the original statue in New York. It is one of three replicas in Paris.

The statue is near the Grenelle Bridge on the Île aux Cygnes, a man-made island in the Seine (). It is a quarter-scale version ( high), and was one of the working models used during construction of the actual Statue of Liberty. This model weighs 14 tons. It was inaugurated on 4 July 1889. Its tablet bears two dates: "IV JUILLET 1776" (4 July 1776: the United States Declaration of Independence) like the New York statue, and "XIV JUILLET 1789" (14 July 1789: the storming of the Bastille) associated with an equal sign. This statue is shown in the film National Treasure: Book of Secrets as a historic location.

Former Musée des Arts et Métiers location 
The  tall original plaster maquette finished in 1878 by Auguste Bartholdi that was used to make the statue in New York is in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. This original plaster model was bequeathed by the artist's widow in 1907, together with part of the artist's estate.

On the square outside the Musée des Arts et Métierss entrance was a bronze copy made from the plaster maquette, number 1 from an original edition of 12, made by the museum and cast by Susse Fondeur Paris. It was this replica that was shipped to America under a joint effort by the Embassy of France in the United States, the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers and the shipping company CMA CGM Group. After spending time on Ellis Island for Independence Day 2021, it now resides at the French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.

Flame of Liberty
A life-size copy of the torch, Flame of Liberty, can be seen above the entrance to the Pont de l'Alma tunnel near the Champs-Élysées in Paris. It was given to the city as a return gift in honour of the centennial celebration of the statue's dedication. Since it is above the Pont de l'Alma car tunnel in which Princess Diana died, the torch became an unofficial memorial to the princess.

Barentin
There is a 13.5 m (44 feet) polyester replica in the northwest of France, in the small town of Barentin near Rouen. It was made for the 1969 French film, Le Cerveau ("The Brain"), directed by Gérard Oury and featuring actors Jean-Paul Belmondo and Bourvil.

Bordeaux
There is a  replica of the statue in the city of Bordeaux. The first Bordeaux statue was seized and melted down by the Nazis in World War II. The statue was replaced in 2000 and a plaque was added to commemorate the victims of the 11 September terrorist attacks. On the night of 25 March 2003, unknown vandals poured red paint and gasoline on the replica and set it on fire. The vandals also cracked the pedestal of the plaque. The mayor of Bordeaux, former prime minister Alain Juppé, condemned the attack.

Colmar

A  replica of the Statue of Liberty in Colmar, the city of Bartholdi's birth, was dedicated on 4 July 2004, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his death. It stands at the north entrance of the city. The Bartholdi Museum in Colmar contains numerous models of various sizes made by Bartholdi during the process of designing the statue.

Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer
Frédéric Bartholdi donated a copy of the Statue of Liberty to the town square of Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer.

United States

 From 1902 to 2002, visitors to midtown Manhattan were occasionally disoriented by what seemed to be an impossibly nearby view of the statue. They were seeing a  replica located at 43 West 64th Street atop the Liberty Warehouse. In February 2002, the statue was removed by the building's owners to allow the building to be expanded. It was donated to the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which installed it in its sculpture garden in October 2005 with plans to restore it on site in spring of 2006.

 The Boy Scouts of America celebrated their fortieth anniversary in 1950 with the theme of "Strengthen the Arm of Liberty". Between 1949 and 1952, approximately two hundred  replicas of the statue, made of stamped copper, were purchased by Boy Scout troops and donated in 39 states in the U.S. and several of its possessions and territories. The project was the brainchild of Kansas City businessman J.P. Whitaker, who was then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council. The copper statues were manufactured by Friedley-Voshardt Co. (Chicago, Illinois) and purchased through the Kansas City Boy Scout office by those wanting one. The statues are approximately  tall without the base, are constructed of sheet copper, weigh , and originally cost $350 plus freight. The mass-produced statues are not great art nor meticulously accurate (a conservator notes that "her face isn't as mature as the real Liberty. It's rounder and more like a little girl's"), but they are cherished, particularly since 9/11. Many have been lost or destroyed, but preservationists have been able to account for about a hundred of them, and BSA Troop 101 of Cheyenne, Wyoming, has collected photographs of over 100 of them. They are commonly installed at city halls, libraries, and schools. One of these statues was sent to the Philippines. After some years at the mouth of the Pasig River, Manila, it was kept in a store room at the Scout Reservation, Makiling, Laguna, for about two decades. It is now stored at the national office of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines, Manila.

South America

Argentina
In Buenos Aires there is a small iron replica in Barrancas de Belgrano Square, cast by Bartholdi from the same mould as those cast in Paris; although it is much smaller. It was inaugurated on 3 October 1886, 25 days before the one in New York. Another replica was bought by the government and placed in a school, Colegio Nacional Sarmiento, about the same date. There is another replica in Plaza Libertad (Liberty Square) in the city of Villa Aberastain, San Juan.

Brazil

In Bangu, Rio de Janeiro exists a nickel replica made by Bartholdi in 1899.

Until 1940, the statue was Paranhos family property. In 1940 the statue was passed to Guanabara State. On 20 January 1964, Carlos Lacerda, governor of Guanabara State, placed the statue in Miami Square, Bangu.

A small-scale cast metal replica can be found in Maceió, the capital of Alagoas State, in northeast Brazil. The replica is in front of a building constructed in 1869 as the seat of the Conselho Provincial (Provincial Council), and which today is the Museu da Imagem e do Som de Alagoas (Museum of Image and Sound of Alagoas). This replica is possibly a casting produced by the  in France, as in the Praça Lavenere Machado (formerly Praça Dois Leões) on the opposite side of the museum, there are four somewhat larger-than-life size cast metal statues of wild animals, at least one of which is embossed with the name of the foundry. These castings and the replica all appear to be made of similar material and to be of similar age. It is also probable that they are near contemporaries of the actual Statue of Liberty.

Philippines

As early as January 1945, there were already news of a campaign that would help erect a Statue of Liberty replica in the Philippines. The said monument was supposed to be sponsored by The Chicago Daily Times whose goal was "to commemorate one of the great epics in the struggle for human freedom–the liberation of the Philippines."

Fast forward to 1950, the Boy Scouts of America was celebrating its 40th anniversary. Jack P. Whitaker, then Scout Commissioner of the Kansas City Area Council, had earlier suggested the creation and distribution of several Statue of Liberty replicas to all American states and territories, including the Philippines.

The eight-foot statues, which were cast in bronze, were distributed all over the U.S. and the world from 1949 to 1951. Almost 200 replicas were delivered to the 39 states of the U.S. and countries such as Panama and Puerto Rico. The Boy Scouts of the Philippines, on the other hand, received its own replica in the early part of 1950.

The statues were donated by the Boy Scouts of America as "an expression of scout brotherhood and goodwill." Their 40th anniversary theme was "Strengthen the Arm of Liberty."

Miniature versions of the statue were also given as gifts. The Philippines became the first independent nation to receive one of the 4,000 eight-inch statues from the Boy Scouts of America. In April 1950, the said statue was officially given by Chief Scout Executive Arthur A. Shuck to Carlos P. Romulo, then chief of the Philippine Mission to the United Nations.

In the Philippines, several places were suggested as the site where the eight-foot bronze replica would be erected. The task of choosing the perfect site was delegated to the National Urban Planning Commission, and among those it considered were “Engineer Island, atop the proposed reviewing stand on the Rizal Park, and on the center island rotunda between the Old Legislative building and Manila City Hall.”

In the end, the Boy Scouts of the Philippines (BSP) erected the statue just outside Intramuros. As the icon of the United States, the replica of Lady Liberty would survive several attacks by student protesters in the 1960s. It remained standing until the early 1970s, when the BSP decided to transfer it to the Scout Reservation in Mt. Makiling which would serve as the statue's home for two decades or so.

In a 2002 article published by the Philippine Star, then BSP PR head Nixon Canlapan revealed that the Statue of Liberty was eventually moved and stored at the BSP headquarters on Concepcion Street (now Natividad Almeda-Lopez) in Ermita, Manila.

Turns out, the American-sponsored replica was not the first Lady Liberty in Manila. In the 1930s, one of Manila's biggest shopping stores at that time became the talk of the town not just for its products but also for its unique multi-story building. Located in Juan Luna Street, the L.R. Aguinaldo's Emporium had an Art Deco facade featuring two contrasting statues: Andres Bonifacio on the right and the Statue of Liberty on the left.

Established by Philippine retailing pioneer Leopoldo R. Aguinaldo, the store would later become known as the Aguinaldo's Department Store. After the war, Leopoldo's son Francisco took over the business and the store was moved to Echague.

The Echague branch in the 1950s was known for introducing its customers to quality products both from the Philippines and abroad. It also commissioned young interior designers to update the store's furniture section. Thus, the store catapulted the careers of famous designers like Myra Cruz, Edgar Ramirez, and Bonnie Ramos, among others. Aguinaldo's succumbed to the competition and closed in the 1960s. The original building in Juan Luna Street still stands, along with both the Bonifacio and the Liberty statues.

Since the creation of the Liberty statues in Intramuros and Juan Luna Street, other Philippine provinces soon followed suit. Statue of Liberty replicas in can be found in Pangasinan and as far as Camp John Hay amphitheater in Baguio.

Vietnam
From 1887 to 1945, Hanoi was home to another copy of the statue. Measuring  tall, it was erected by the French colonial government after being sent from France for an exhibition. It was known to locals unaware of its history as  (Statue of the Western lady wearing dress). When the French lost control of French Indochina during World War II, the statue was toppled on 1 August 1945, after being deemed a vestige of the colonial government along with other statues erected by the French.

Australia
A 30-foot replica can also be seen at the Westfield Marion shopping complex in Adelaide, South Australia.
