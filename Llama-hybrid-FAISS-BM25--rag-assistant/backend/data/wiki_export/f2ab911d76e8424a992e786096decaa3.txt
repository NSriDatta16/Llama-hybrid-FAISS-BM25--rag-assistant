Recreation and conservation

The Upper Mountain Fork River offers  of canoeing or kayaking from near Hatfield, Arkansas to Broken Bow Lake. This part of the river has class I and II rapids. clear water, fishing for smallmouth bass and other species, and excellent scenery with pine forests covering the hills and bluffs along the river's course. Water levels in the river are generally adequate for boating year-round.  On the upper portion of Broken Bow Lake is the McCurtain County Wilderness Area, an Oklahoma State-owned  tract which contains the largest remaining virgin shortleaf pine/hardwood forest in the nation. Hunting is permitted in the wilderness area.

Below Broken Bow dam and lake, the  of the Lower Mountain Fork is described as the "consistently flowing and best whitewater stream" in Oklahoma. Class I and II rapids are found in the upper part of this section and paddlers must navigate waterfalls with a  drop.  Bald cypress trees line and, in some places, grow in the river.   The cool waters issuing below Broken Bow dam provide year-round habitat and fishing for rainbow and brown trout which are stocked regularly throughout the year.  In 2008, a  brown trout was caught by an angler in the Mountain Fork.
