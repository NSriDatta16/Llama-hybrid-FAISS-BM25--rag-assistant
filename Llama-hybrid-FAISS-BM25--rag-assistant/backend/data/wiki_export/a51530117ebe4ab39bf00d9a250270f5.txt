Fleshies is an American punk rock band from Oakland, California, United States, that released three albums on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles, Kill the Dreamer's Dream, The Sicilian, and Scrape the Walls. Fleshies have also released albums on Recess Records ("Brown Flag"), Adeline Records ("The Futbol EP"), Life is Abuse Records, Thrillhouse Records and S.P.A.M. Records, as well as singles, 7" records and splits on a variety of labels. They are known for their outlandish stage presence, their left-wing politics and their non-stop world touring schedule from 1999 to 2006. From their inception, they were an influential presence at events such as Geekfest, held in the late 1990s, The Fest in Gainesville, Florida, and Wantage Records' Total Fest. As of May 2019, the band released Introducing The Fleshies on Portland's Dirt Cult Records, its first album in ten years.

Members of the band have also played (or currently play) in projects such as Triclops!, Harbinger, Meercaz and the Visions, Street Eaters, Swiftumz, Pigs, and  Pins of Light
