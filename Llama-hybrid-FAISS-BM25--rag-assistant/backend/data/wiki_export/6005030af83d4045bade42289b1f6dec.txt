Diomin is a dark fantasy role-playing game, designed by R. Hyrum Savage and published by OtherWorld Creations (OWC).  The only familiar race in Diomin are the humans, who are divided into two cultures: the good-leaning "Tirasim" and the evil-leaning "Zeredites". OWC has announced plans to release Diomin material for the new version of RuneQuest, published by Mongoose Publishing.

History
Diomin was a fantasy setting which was originally designed for GURPS, but after starting RPG publisher OtherWorld Creations (OWC) during the d20 boom, R. Hyrum Savage and his friends Chad Cunningham and Chris Miller were convinced by the d20 licensing to convert Diomin to d20 and the company released it in 2000. OtherWorld supported Diomin with publications through 2003, but production was halted soon after with the crash of the d20 market. Savage brought back OtherWorld Creations in 2006 using another licensing opportunity similar to the OGL, and thus Diomin was brought back for the Mongoose Publishing version of the RuneQuest system, with new books that were mostly released as PDFs.

Races 
Arak: An insular people with blue skin, black hair, and reddish eyes.  Tribal and proud.
Gadianti: A race of bipedal catpeople marked as jaguars or tigers.  One of the two main "villain races" of Diomin (the other being the Zeredites) who obey Akish, one of Diomin's Lords of Darkness.
Gnolaum: A seafaring and long-lived race whose culture resembles that of feudal Japan.
Hearthom: Mysterious beings who resemble living statues (with hair).  Their origins are hidden and while there are male and female Hearthom, there seems to be an utter lack of Hearthom children.
Humans (see Tirasim and Zeredites)  Both cultures of humans have practices that resemble those of the ancient Greeks (Tirasim) and Sumerians (Zeredites).
Tirasim are descendants of the Zeredites who fled East to found a new nation at the behest of Barak, chief deity of the Warriors of Light.
Zeredites were outcasts from the Arak during the Gods War and were the first humans on Diomin.

Classes 
With the sole exception of the Rogue class, all of the core D&D base classes are modified for their niche in the d20 edition Diomin, if only in terms of cultural availability.  The Paladin class receives the most in terms of game mechanic changes, followed by the Wizard.  Also introduced is the Shaman class and Spirit Magic.  The RuneQuest system does not use character classes.
