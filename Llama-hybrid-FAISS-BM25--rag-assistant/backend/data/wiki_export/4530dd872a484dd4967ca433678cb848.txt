The rules are non-negotiable, for each week of the holiday one of the families is in charge in their ideal holiday location. Both families have a challenge - to convince the other of the wonders of their holiday.
 
Holiday Showdown guarantees stress and conflict aplenty but also surprising insights discovering what happens when one family's idea of holiday heaven is someone else's holiday hell!
 
In 2007, Holiday Showdown was re-branded as Holiday Showdown: Extreme, but kept its original format.
