Andy Freed (born 1971 in Ellicott City, Maryland) is a radio announcer for the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. He and fellow broadcaster Dave Wills shared play-by-play and color commentating duties for the Rays from 2005 until Wills' death in 2023, often alternating roles for several innings at a time during ballgames. 

In 2016, Freed signed a contract extension with the Tampa Bay Rays Radio Network which will keep him with the team until at least the 2019 season. During baseball's offseason, Freed has done college basketball broadcasts for ESPN Regional.

Freed's radio career has featured work with the Pawtucket Red Sox, the Trenton Thunder, and the St. Lucie Mets in minor league baseball. He also did radio broadcasts for Providence College basketball, Rider University basketball, College of New Jersey football, and Baltimore Spirit soccer. Freed started his broadcast career while still a student at his alma mater, Towson State University, when he covered various sporting events for the university's radio station, WTMD.
