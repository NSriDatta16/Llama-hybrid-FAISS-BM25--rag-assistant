Characters

Woody Woodpecker / Winnie Woodpecker / Knothead and Splinter
 Woody Woodpecker - a mischievous pileated woodpecker who lives in a tree-house overlooking his landlady's house in the suburbs of the Southland. His personality mirrors Tom Sawyer, a lazy and crazy moocher or even a freeloader, often looking for ways to get by without lifting a finger. This does not endear him to his rivals, but Woody doesn't take their resistance lightly. His father is Scottish, and Woody is proud of his Scottish heritage, even though he uses English golf balls and oftentimes shows English traits, or rather British traits.
 Winnie Woodpecker - a female pileated woodpecker and Woody's best friend/girlfriend who tends to get into her own misadventures. She has a more dignified persona than Woody's.
 Knothead and Splinter - Woody and Winnie's nephew and niece, respectively, a pair of young pileated woodpeckers who can't help but give to their uncle (and anybody else) a hard time.
 Buzz Buzzard - a sleazy common buzzard who is the main antagonist of the series. He always concocts scams and cons on Woody, Winnie or Knothead and Splinter, though the woodpeckers frequently outsmart him. 
 Tweaky the Lackey - a domestic canary who is usually Buzz's henchman, often reluctant about it.
 Wally Walrus - a Swedish walrus who is Woody's neighbor and long-time foil but is not as antagonistic as either Buzz or other characters with Woody being always greedy and looking for mischief to ensue. Despite his rivalry with Woody, there are times where the duo team up and work together.
 Ms. Meany - Woody's ugly old landlady who rents the tree-house Woody lives in and Wally's neighbor. Being more violent than other characters, she is generally more antagonistic and mean-spirited than both Buzz and Wally. She is often portrayed as a hard worker who takes her job seriously and respects those in authority.
 Dapper Denver Dooley - an obnoxious manchild who always tries to steal things from Woody.

Chilly Willy
 Chilly Willy - a voiceless penguin who lives in Antarctica, his misadventures result from his constant endeavors to fill his empty stomach and/or find relief from the cold. Despite his innocent demeanor, Chilly is quite the troublemaker.
 Smedley - a hound dog that is frequently at odds with Chilly, though usually portrayed as more an authority figure than an antagonist. He is very easygoing and generally does not break his calm demeanor, but Chilly always pushes Smedley's patience to the breaking point.
 Chilly Lilly - a female penguin who is Chilly Willy's girlfriend and appears in the episode "Chilly Lilly".
 Maxie the Polar Bear - an intelligent polar bear who is one of Chilly's friends. He makes a few appearances on Chilly's segments.
 Sgt. Hogwash - a pig military officer who operates in a government base in the Antarctic and is plagued by Chilly's mischievousness.
 Major Bull - a bull who is Hogwash's superior.

Other characters
 Dr. Doug Nutts - a physician who is impersonating Don Knotts. He appears in the episode "Woody and the Termite" until "Painfaker".
 Mother Nature - a fairy who usually gets onto Woody for being too lazy to fulfill his role in nature. She appears in the episodes "Woody and the Termite", "Downsized Woody", "Whistle Stop Woody" and "Teacher's Pet". In "Teacher's Pet", her appearance is different from that in the three prior episodes. She retains her original pre-design in Crazy Castle 5.
 Creepy Badger - a creepy and psychotic badger. While is not generally a real villain, he has worked alongside Wally Walrus as assistant and played the role as the main antagonist in one episode. He speaks in a gravelly, deep, and generally creepy voice. He also really loves tobogganing. His catchphrase is "Hi-ya, buddy!".
 Nicky Knickknacker - a high society pileated woodpecker thief who appears in the episode "Eenie, Meany, Out You Go".
 Billy and Louie - a pair of troublemaker dogs that had the tendency to annoy Knothead and Splinter. Billy is the leader and aggressive of the duet, while Louie is a little dumb.
 Woody's Father - a pileated woodpecker who is the father of Woody.
 Caveman Woodpecker - a caveman who is a woodpecker.
 Judge - a judge who appears in the episode "Painfaker" until "Couples Therapy". In "Stage Fright", he condemns Buzz and Tweakey.
 Willy Walrus - Wally's nephew who appears in the episodes "Just Say Uncle" and "Stuck on You".
 Cupid - a cupid who appears in the episode "Date with Destiny".
 Woodrow Woodpecker - a nerdy woodpecker who appears in "Teacher's Pet".
