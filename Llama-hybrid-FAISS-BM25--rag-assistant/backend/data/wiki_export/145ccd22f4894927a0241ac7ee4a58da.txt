Oleg Felevich Bozhev () (born 25 August 1961 in Moscow, Russian SFSR) is a former speed skater. He trained at VSS Trud.

Short biography
Competing for the Soviet Union, Oleg Bozhev had his best year in 1984 when he won a bronze medal on the 1,500 m at the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, became World Allround Champion ten days later, became Soviet Allround Champion two weeks after that and skated a world record on the 1,500 m another two weeks later. He also was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples that year. The following three years (1985-1987), he won silver at the World Allround Championships. The closest he came to winning a second World Allround Championship was in 1986 when he finished second behind Hein Vergeer, with a difference of only 0.014 points, which translates to a mere 0.28 seconds of difference on the final distance (the 10,000 m). Except for one more international appearance in 1992, his last international appearance was in 1988.

Bozhev currently is the senior coach of the Russian skating team.
