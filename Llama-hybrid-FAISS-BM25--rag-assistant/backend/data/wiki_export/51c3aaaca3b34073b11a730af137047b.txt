History
The opening up of these lands began in 1939 when several families from Minas Gerais and Bahia settled along the banks of the Rio Claro and the Córrego Encantado seeking gold and diamonds.  In 1944 a dirt road was opened and a village was formed called Boa Vista, because of the location on the plateau between Iporá and Cachoeira de Goiás.  In 1947 the first church dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Abadia was built and one year later came the first primary school.  In 1952 Boa Vista was made a district of Aurilândia and the name was changed to Ivolândia, in homage to the pioneer Ivo Moreira Neves.  In 1953 it was raised to municipal status.
