The Howling Commandos is the name of several fictional groups appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team also appears in the franchises developed for other media.

Fictional team history

Original Incarnation (1963)

The first group of Howling Commandos (introduced in their own 1963 comic book series) was an elite unit of the United States Army Rangers formed in World War II. The original team consisted of:

 Sergeant Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury
 Corporal Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader "Dum Dum" Dugan
 Private Isadore "Izzy" Cohen
 Private Gabriel Jones
 Private Dino Manelli
 Private Robert "Rebel" Ralston
 Private Jonathan "Junior" Juniper
 Private Percival "Pinky" Pinkerton: A British soldier, in issue #8.
 Private Eric Koenig: A defector from Nazi Germany. He joined the squad in issue #27.
 Private Jim Morita
 Private Jacques "Frenchie" Dernier

Occasional other members would join for an issue or two before being killed, transferred, or otherwise leaving (such as Fred Jones in issue #81). Also daringly for the time, the series killed Fury's girlfriend, British nurse Pamela Hawley, introduced in issue #4 and killed in a London air raid in #18.

Nick Fury's Howling Commandos

A second Howling Commandos team was introduced in the 2005 series Nick Fury's Howling Commandos as a supernatural unit that works for S.H.I.E.L.D. Its members were:

 Clay Quartermain: The commanding officer of Area 13. He takes over in the first issue from Dum Dum Dugan.
 Warwolf (real name Vince Marcus): The field leader. He is a werewolf who can transform voluntarily whenever Mars is in the night sky.
 Nina Price, Vampire by Night: A woman who is half-vampire and half-werewolf.
 N'Kantu, the Living Mummy: A previously existing character. N'Kantu is an undead prince of Ancient Egypt.
 Frankenstein: An intelligent clone of the original Frankenstein's Monster. How this process did not produce different clones of the various individual body parts making up the original Monster was briefly mentioned in issue #1. The response was "Don't go there".
 Gorilla-Man I: A previously existing character. Kenneth Hale is a man trapped in a gorilla's body. He is now a member of the Agents of Atlas.
 John Doe: A zombie depicted as having normal human-level intelligence, in contrast to other zombie characters in the Marvel universe.

 Phobos: The ten-year-old son of Ares. He possesses the power to cause fear in others by looking in their eyes.
 Druid: The son of Doctor Druid who has inherited some of his father's skill with magic.
 Yo-Yo: The daughter of the Griffin. She can run at superhuman speed and bounces back to the point where she began running.
 Hellfire: The grandson of the Phantom Rider. He is able to charge a chain with fire to wield as a weapon.
 Stonewall: Son of the Absorbing Man. Daisy Johnson bails him out of jail after he is imprisoned for hitting a cop. Possesses superhuman strength. Very little so far has been revealed about the character.

Under the leadership of Dum Dum Dugan and Gabe Jones, they became a private military company which is hired by Nick Fury to fight against both Hydra and H.A.M.M.E.R.

MAX
In Fury and Fury: Peacemaker by Garth Ennis, the Howling Commandos were an OSS special operations unit created by Fury and modeled after the SAS. Most of the unit's lineup were wiped out following D-Day, and only Fury and two other members survived (one of whom is most likely Dum-Dum Dugan, who appears in Fury MAX).

During the Ultimate X-Men comic, Nick Fury dispatches a special S.H.I.E.L.D. unit to protect the Triskelion from elements of the Academy of Tomorrow, who came to break out one of their own.

A new version of the Howling Commandos appeared in Ultimate Comics: Ultimates #20; S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Monica Chang grants Nick Fury and ex-Hydra soldier Abigail Brand to take on the growing power of Hydra.

The full team finally makes its debut during the Dark Ultimates' attack on Earth. Besides Nick Fury, Monica Chang and Abigail Brand, the roster consists of Punisher, Falcon, Stature, Dum Dum Dugan, Danny "The Ghost" Ketch, Emil "The Abomination" Blonsky, and Hercules
