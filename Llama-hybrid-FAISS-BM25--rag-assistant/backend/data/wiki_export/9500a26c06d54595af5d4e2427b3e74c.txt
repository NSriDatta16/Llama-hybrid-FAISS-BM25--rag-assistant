Princess Wilhelmine of Baden (Wilhelmine Louise; 21 September 1788 – 27 January 1836), was by birth a Princess of Baden from the House of Zähringen and by marriage Grand Duchess consort of Hesse and by Rhine. Her descendants include the last emperor of Russia, Nicholas II and his wife Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, King Charles III of the United Kingdom, King Felipe VI of Spain, and other members of European royalty.

She was the youngest daughter of Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden and Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the younger sister of Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna of Russia, born Princess Louise of Baden.

Life
Princess Wilhelmine Louise of Baden was born on 21 September 1788 as the eighth and youngest child of Charles Louis, Hereditary Prince of Baden (1755–1801) and Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt (1754–1832). In Karlsruhe on 19 June 1804, Wilhelmine married her maternal second cousin Louis, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt (1777–1848). The union proved to be unhappy due to Louis's extramarital affairs, and they separated after the birth of their three older children.

In 1820, she acquired Schloss Heiligenberg, where Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy (1794–1871) was the chamberlain, and they started an affair. Her last four children were believed to have been fathered by Senarclens de Grancy, although they were recognized by Grand Duke Louis II as his own. In 1830, following her father-in-law's death, she became Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine.
