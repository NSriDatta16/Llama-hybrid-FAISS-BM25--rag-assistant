Moor Grange Estate is a housing estate in the West Park area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, which was built in the 1950s on reclaimed farmland. Work on the Moor Grange Estate began in 1955.  It was originally owned by the local council, and was leased by the council to tenants as a council estate. Most of the housing on the estate is now privately owned.  Moor Grange does not suffer the crime problems of other council estates (including the nearby Hawksworth Estate).  House prices on the estate are high, and Moor Grange is considered a 'model council estate'.  This may be due to the affluence of the area in which it is situated.  Moor Grange backs onto the smaller Spen Estate which is another council estate in West Park. The Estate falls within the Kirkstall ward of the Leeds Metropolitan Council.

For details on the original planning of the estate see the Leodis website.

Education

Moor Grange  was also the name of a boys county secondary school sited across the ring road. In the latter stages of its life it was renamed Moor Grange High School. It had a football pitch, a cricket square, a rugby field, an athletics area including long jump, high jump and pole vault, a running track of 440 yards and two tennis courts. It also boasted a gym and its assembly hall was frequently used as an additional gym. It has since been demolished and a HM Revenue and Customs House has been built on the site.

On the junction of Spen Lane and Butcher Hill was West Park County Secondary (Girls) School. This building has now been demolished and a new housing estate is in the process of being built.

Abbey Grange School is located on Butcher Hill near to Hawksworth. Abbey Grange School was named after a former Kirkstall Abbey Mannor.  The School was opened on 11 October 1952 by the then Princess Royal Princess Mary, Countess of Harewood.

Buildings

Moor Grange has three rows of shops which include newsagents, charity shop, and grocers. It does not have a church but close by on West Park is the West Park United Reformed Church. Another church was built in the late 1960s called St Andrews on the junction of Butcher Hill and Old Oak Drive which is technically on the Spen estate. Details on the St Andrews web site . The row of shops that has the Co-op is technically on the Spen Estate and used to contain a Milk delivery dairy and in the 70's a Fish and Chip Shop opened which was formerly a butcher shop.

Housing

There is a wide variety of council housing in Moor Grange built throughout the 1950s and 1960s.  Most of the estate is made up of red brick semi-detached houses, there are also flats built in the style of houses, and a few rows of red brick terraced houses.  There is the Linton Croft complex of sheltered housing situated at the top of Old Farm Parade.  There are three blocks of high rise flats, these being Clayton Court, Clayton Grange (both of which were used for the filming of The Beiderbecke Affair) and Moor Grange Court situated on Butcher Hill.  There are also several smaller blocks of flats (three and four stories) situated around the estate, as well as flats built in the style of houses.  There are also flats situated above all of the parades of shops on the estate.

Overview
Most Street names are preceded by Old Farm, Latchmere, Moor Grange and Fillingfir.  It also benefits from three large grassed areas for recreation.  Close by for fishing are Clayton Ponds which are located in Clayton Wood. Some old and recent pictures of the estate can be seen on the Leodis website which has a large collection of photos from Leeds and surrounding areas.  It is circled by the West Park section of the Leeds Outer Ring Road (A6120), Spen Lane and Butcher Hill. There are three high rise blocks of flats: one on Butcher Hill called Moor Grange Court; the other two are Clayton Grange and Clayton Court at the bottom of Fillingfir Drive. At the corner of Old Farm Parade are three sets of maisonettes which have recently been renovated on the outside.

Proximity to the airport
Moor Grange is situated about 4 miles from Leeds Bradford International Airport.  Since 2000 the air traffic to the airport has increased from around 1.6 million passengers a year to over 3 million passengers a year.  This has led to a large increase in air traffic over the estate, particularly in the summer months.  The frequency of the extra traffic, has caused annoyance to some residents.  At peak time, five or six passenger jets may pass over Moor Grange to land at the airport every hour.  The level of traffic is expected to grow further.

History
Moor Grange had a number of bus routes either passing through or terminating/starting on the estate.

West Yorkshire Bus route number 655 from Leeds to Bradford and the similar route 755 both skirted the estate via Spen Lane and Butcher Hill. These routes have been either discontinued or re-routed due to the deregulation of the bus routes in the 1980s. Route 135 was a school bus route and operated the same route as the 74 but terminated at the Beckett Park estate; it ran through the week purely for pupils of Beckett Park Junior mixed and Infant School.
