Diponegoro University (; , abbreviated as UNDIP) is a public university in Semarang, Central Java, Indonesia. Founded in 1957 as a private university by the Semarang University Foundation, which later in 1960 became public university, and named after Javanese Prince Diponegoro. It is the oldest education corporation in Central Java.

History 

In the early 1950s, people in Central Java, especially in Semarang, needed a university to provide higher education learning and teaching facilities. It has been purpose to support of government in handling and in conducting all sectors of development, especially in the field of education. At that time, it was only Gajah Mada University as a public university which provides higher education for people in Yogyakarta and also Central Java.

As the number of senior high school graduates have continuously been increasing without increment in the number of universities, some graduates may not be able to gain a seat in higher education in north of Central Java. Considering this situation, MR. Imam Bardjo and his colleagues formed an educational foundation, namely Yayasan Universitas Semarang (Foundation of Semarang University), noted by notary R.M. Soeprapto on Notarial Deed No 59, 4 December 1956. The foundation was the first step to establish a university in Semarang, namely Semarang University, which was officially opened on 9 January 1957, and Mr. Imam Bardjo was the first President (Rector) of the university.

When Semarang University celebrated its third Dies Natalis (anniversary) on 9 January 1960, President of Indonesia, Sukarno renamed the Semarang University as Diponegoro University. Changing the name of Semarang University was intended as a tribute to the university's performance in development of higher education in Central Java. The President's decision was confirmed by the Government Regulation No. 7 1961 and Decree Minister of Education, Teaching and Culture No. 101247 / UU on 3 December 1960.

The decision was retroactive to 15 October 1957, and this date is commemorated as the day of Diponegoro University's Dies Natalis as well as for remembering "Five Days Battle in Semarang", which is part of Indonesian National Revolution war that took place in Semarang City. Diponegoro University chose the date as its Dies Natalis for continuing national heroes' vision and mission for Indonesia's independence, by developing the nation's next generation.

The year of 1957 was defined as the year of Diponegoro University's establishment, by considering history of Semarang University as a private university founded in 1957 was an embryo of Diponegoro University. And the date of establishment 15 October 1957 was stated in Rector's report on the 13th Dies Natalis of Diponegoro University.

Currently under Government Regulations No. 81/2014 and Government Regulations of the Republic of Indonesia No. 52/2015, Diponegoro University earns the status of PTN-BH (Perguruan Tinggi Negeri-Badan Hukum/State-Owned Higher Education with a Legal Entity Status).
