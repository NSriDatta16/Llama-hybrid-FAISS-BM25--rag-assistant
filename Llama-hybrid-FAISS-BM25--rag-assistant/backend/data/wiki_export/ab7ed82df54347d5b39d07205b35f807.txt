Barclaya is a genus of six species of flowering plants of the family Nymphaeaceae. Barclaya are aquatic plants native to tropical Asia. The genus was named in honour of the American-born English brewer and patron of science Robert Barclay.

Synonym
Though Hydrostemma is a name that is older than the name Barclaya, having been published 6 months earlier, the name Barclaya has been "conserved" as it was deemed being much better known than Hydrostemma.

Taxonomy

Rejected classification
The separate family Barclayaceae H.L.Li was published in 1955. It has been believed to be separate, due to the extended perianth tube (combined sepals and petals) arising from the top of the ovary and by stamens that are joined basally. However, morphological and genetic studies support the position of Barclaya in the family Nymphaeaceae.
A separate order Barclayales Doweld was proposed in 2001.

The accepted placement of Barclaya is within the family Nymphaeaceae of the order Nymphaeales.

Description
Plants grow from egg-shaped tubers that produce short runners and a basal rosette of leaves. All leaves are submerged.

Cytology
The chromosome count of Barclaya longifolia is n=17.

Species

Habitat
Within tropical rainforests, Barclaya develops alongside streams or at their fringes. The escalating deforestation across Southeast Asia is causing the habitats to become clouded, endangering Barclaya.

Cultivation
Barclaya longifolia is a popular aquarium plant. Under high light conditions the attractive, upright foliage displays green colouration. Under lower light conditions brownish foliage is produced. It easily sets seed in cultivation, if pollen is deposited on the stigma.
