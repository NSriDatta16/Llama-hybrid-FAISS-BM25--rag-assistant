Recording
Recording sessions for the album began at RCA Studio B in Nashville, Tennessee, on May 14, 1969. Three additional sessions followed on May 20, 21 and June 2. "Daddy" was recorded on September 9, 1968, during a session for 1969's In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad).

Content
The title song tells the story of a small town girl whose aspirations take her to New Orleans, where she becomes a prostitute, dreaming of the boy she'd left behind. "Gypsy, Joe and Me" details the story of a woman, her love and their small dog, who all eventually perish. "Evening Shade" tells the story of an orphanage run by an evil headmistress, Mrs. Bailey. The orphans eventually burn the home down, with Mrs. Bailey sleeping inside. "Daddy", a Parton composition, tells the story of a daughter pleading with her father to reconsider leaving her mother for a woman much younger.

Also included are Parton's covers of the Mac Davis-penned Elvis Presley hit "In the Ghetto" and Joe South's "Games People Play". She also covered current country hits by Porter Wagoner ("Big Wind") and Jan Howard ("We Had All the Good Things Going").

In a CMT interview with Patty Loveless, Parton confirmed that the man on the album cover is her reclusive husband, Carl Dean.

Critical reception

The review in the September 20, 1969 issue of Billboard said, "Undoubtedly, this is the best composite album that Miss Dolly Parton has created. Her country version of "In the Ghetto" is now on the country singles chart and should provide plenty of LP sales impetus. While her "Daddy", "Gypsy, Joe and Me", and "Home for Pete's Sake" are tearjerkers in the traditional vein. "Games People Play" is also a strong contender for honors."

Cashbox also published a review of the album, saying, "Dolly Parton effectively changes moods and tempos as she sings her way through this set containing her latest singles in addition to other noteworthy offerings. The set includes, besides title track, "In the Ghetto", "Games People Play", "Big Wind", "Daddy", and "We Had All the Good Things Going." Rapid chart action can be expected on this one."

AllMusic gave the album 3 out of 5 stars.

On a list of the top 50 Dolly Parton songs, Rolling Stone magazine listed the title track at number 31, and "Evening Shade" at number 23.
