Hollywood, Tennessee is the ninth studio album by American country music singer Crystal Gayle. Released in August 1981, it peaked at #5 on the Billboard Country Albums chart.

As the title intends to suggest, half of the album was produced in a pop music style, whilst the other half was produced in a "Tennessee" country music style. It includes four singles released in 1982 and 1983 which appeared on the Billboard Country charts: "The Woman in Me" (#3), "You Never Gave Up on Me" (#5), "Living in These Troubled Times" (#9), and "Keepin' Power" (#49).
