Professional career
Despite his injury-plagued year, Helm was invited to the 2006 Adidas MLS Combine, where his performance earned him the first overall selection in the 2006 MLS Supplemental Draft by Chivas USA, who signed him to a developmental contract.

Following the season, he left Chivas to join lower-division Portuguese club Marinhas for the remainder of the 2006/07 season.
