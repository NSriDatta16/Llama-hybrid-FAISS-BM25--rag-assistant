Mian Channu, alternately spelled Mian Chunnun, is the capital city of Mian Channu Tehsil in Khanewal District, Punjab province of Pakistan.

Etymology 
The city was named after a Sufi saint, Baba Mian Channu, who had lived there at one point. After his death, he was buried there. There is an urban legend about the name; it is believed that during the British rule, administration attempted to change the name of the city. They painted all boards with the new name. However, an unknown vandal changed the boards back to the original name. They tried repeatedly in vain, and since then, the name of the city remained 'Mian Channu'.

Mian Channu has many services and areas for its inhabitants, as well as tourists.

History 
In the year 1919, Mian Channu was considered a village, and by 1938, it was considered a town. Its limits were last extended in the year 1950. Since then, no extension has been made, and the development of the town from 1947 to 1961 remained slow. A municipal council was established in 1975, as it had grown into small urban centre by that time. After that, the town began developing, and major growth has been taking place, from 1972 to 1984. The trend of growth in this period has largely been along G.T Road, and in the northern direction.

It has been the headquarters of the Mian Channu Tehsil of Khanewal District since 1985, and is administratively subdivided into three Union councils.

For more than a century, Mian Channu was part of Multan District. With the raising of status of Mian Channu to a tehsil headquarters, and the creation of Khanewal District on 1 July 1985, Mian Channu Tehsil became a part of Khanewal District.

In 2009, a bombing killed approximately 12 people.  

An accidentally fired BrahMos missile from India landed in Mian Channu in 2022, resulting in the 2022 India–Pakistan missile incident.
