The BMW N46 is a naturally aspirated inline-four piston engines which replaced the BMW N42 and was produced from 2004 to 2015.

The N46 serves as the basis for the smaller BMW N45 engine (which does not have Valvetronic).

In 2007, the N46's successor - the BMW N43 - was introduced. However, the direct-injected N43 was not sold in countries with high-sulfur fuel, so the N46 continued to be produced alongside the N43. The N46 continued production until 2015, when the last N46 models were replaced by the BMW N13 turbocharged four-cylinder engine.

Design 
Compared with its N42 predecessor, the N46 features a revised crankshaft, intake manifold and valvetrain. In 2007, the N46 was updated, which was known as the N46N. Changes included the intake manifold, exhaust camshaft and the engine control unit was changed from Bosch Motronic version ME9.2 to version MV17.4.6. The redline is 6,500 rpm.
