James Caldwell High School is a four-year comprehensive public high school serving students in ninth through twelfth grades in West Caldwell, in Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, operating as the lone secondary school of the Caldwell-West Caldwell Public Schools, which serves students from both Caldwell and West Caldwell. The school is named after American Revolutionary War figure Reverend James Caldwell. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.

As of the 2021–22 school year, the school had an enrollment of 843 students and 78.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.8:1. There were 53 students (6.3% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 4 (0.5% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.

History
The original Caldwell High School was built in 1910, at which time it served students from Essex Fells, Fairfield Township, Hanover Township, Livingston, North Caldwell, Roseland and Verona, who attended as part of sending/receiving relationships with their home school districts. It was replaced in 1925 by Grover Cleveland High School.

As the high school became increasingly overcrowded, a 1957 referendum was held to consider the establishment of a regional high school district to serve all of the communities attending school in Caldwell; Caldwell and North Caldwell residents voted against the regionalization, while Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell and Roseland all voted in favor of the creation of the West Essex Regional School District. In 1960, James Caldwell High School replaced Grover Cleveland High School, which was repurposed as a junior high school.
