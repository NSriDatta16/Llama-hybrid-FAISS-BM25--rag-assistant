The National Union of Congolese Workers (UNTC), (previously known as the Union Nationale des Travailleurs du Zaire (UNTZa)) is the largest trade union centre in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Founded in 1967, the UNTZa was the sole trade union centre in Zaire. By 1990 the union expelled its general secretary, Komdo Ntonga Booke, a member of the party central committee, and broke away from its close ties with the government. This came after the steady decline of workers purchasing power in the late 1980s.

In 1997, the union was renamed the UNTC, reflecting the renaming of Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
