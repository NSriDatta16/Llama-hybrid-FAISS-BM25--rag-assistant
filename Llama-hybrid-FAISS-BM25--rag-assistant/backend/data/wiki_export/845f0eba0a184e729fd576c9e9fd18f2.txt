Reactions

Tedy Dragomir (the owner of Playboy): "We are deeply pained by this, I cannot believe it. We tried so hard in order to make him well. We had almost collected all the money needed for his treatment."

Ioan Neculaie (the owner of FC Brașov): "I met Dossey only as a player for the club I own, but I can say about him that I never heard anyone saying bad things about him. His character was an example. It is unbelievable."
