Fred Schneider and the Shake Society is the debut solo studio album by American new wave musician Fred Schneider, released in 1984 by Warner Bros. Records. It was re-released in 1991 as Fred Schneider.

Musicians and backing vocalists varied from track to track. Notable names included co-producer Bernie Worrell on keyboards, synthesizers and/or backing vocals on several tracks, as well as Schneider's B-52's bandmate Kate Pierson on backing vocals on four tracks, including "Monster" (in addition to appearing in its music video).

The song "Monster" peaked at No. 85 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1991, and its music video was included that year on the VHS video compilation The B-52's: 1979–1989.

In November 2020, Schneider released a new music video for the song "This Planet's a Mess".
