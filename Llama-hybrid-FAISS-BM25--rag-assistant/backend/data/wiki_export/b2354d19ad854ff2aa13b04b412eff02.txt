The Prahran Football Club (), nicknamed the Two Blues, is an Australian rules football club based at Toorak Park in Armadale, Melbourne, Victoria. The club is currently in Division 1 of the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The nickname Two Blues comes from the club uniform which has been royal blue and sky blue since the club formed in 1886.

Prahran fields Senior, Reserves, Club XVIII and junior teams.

History 

Prahran first played as a senior club in the Victorian Football Association in 1886 and 1887, playing its games first at the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground, then at the Wesley College Ground. After 1887, it amalgamated with the neighbouring St Kilda Football Club, which was based less than a mile away.

Prahran was reformed as a club on 15 March 1899, and joined the VFA that season, this time playing at Toorak Park, approximately two miles from St Kilda. It played in the VFA between 1899 and 1994, with the exception of 1959, when it competed in the Metropolitan League; this was because the Prahran Council would not lease Toorak Park to Prahran's Seconds team, leaving the club expelled from the Association's requirements for failing to meet its minimum home ground requirements. At the end of 1994, when administration of the VFA was turned over to the Victorian State Football League, Prahran left the Association as part of the VSFL's efforts to reduce the size of the VFA and align it with the TAC Cup; Prahran's identity was carried on within the TAC Cup from 1995, when the Central Dragons club moved to Toorak Park and was renamed the Prahran Dragons, a name it carried until the end of 1999.

The club continued to exist in an administrative capacity after its departure from the VFA, and continued to operate the Prahran Tabaret – a gambling bar it owns and operates in Chapel Street, Prahran – despite having no on-field presence. In 1999, the club merged with Southbank Amateur Football Club in 1999 and joined the Victorian Amateur Football Association under the stewardship of Herald Sun racing writer Tim Habel. It also re-established its junior arm; and, after commencing with just two junior teams, the club now has eight junior teams and has formed a joint Under 19 team with Caulfield Football Club. In 2010, a joint venture with Assumption College was approved and in 2011 the club changed its name to Prahran/Assumption Football Club. The club won 2 premierships in 2011 and 2017 as Prahran Assumption, and reverted to the ‘Prahran’ moniker only in 2023.
