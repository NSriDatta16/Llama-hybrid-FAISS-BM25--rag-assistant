The Kyriale is a collection of Gregorian chant settings for the Ordinary of the Mass. It contains eighteen Masses (each consisting of the Kyrie, Gloria [excluded from Masses intended for weekdays/ferias and Sundays in Advent and Lent], Sanctus, and Agnus Dei), six Credos, and several ad libitum chants. This collection is included in liturgical books such as the Graduale Romanum and Liber Usualis, and it is also published as a separate book by the monks of Solesmes Abbey.

In the Kyriale, the individual chants of the Ordinary are grouped into complete sets, whose title usually indicates the opening of the prosula formerly sung to each respective Kyrie melody. These masses are followed by individual items not grouped with the complete masses.

A shorter Kyriale is included in the second edition of the Graduale Simplex.

Contents 
The following list of Masses indicates the seasons or feasts for which each Mass is intended. In practice, however, Mass settings may be used on days that fall outside the seasons or feasts listed below; additionally, chants may be extracted from multiple Mass settings for use during a given Mass.

For most Mass settings, the seasonal/festal classification is listed as follows: as practiced prior to the 1955 liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII/as practiced under the 1960 Code of Rubrics of Pope John XXIII/as practiced following the liturgical reforms of Pope Paul VI.
