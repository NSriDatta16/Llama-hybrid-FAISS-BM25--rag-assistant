Philippe Nicolet (born 4 January 1953 in Lausanne), is a Swiss film director of both documentaries and fiction. Journalist and scriptwriter, he was the first editor-in-chief of the Lausanne television station before embarking on a project tracing the history of relations between Switzerland and the European Union for the Jean Monnet Foundation, of which Professor Henri Rieben was the president. In addition to documentary footage filmed in some fifty countries, he became known for his hundreds of interviews of political, scientific and artistic personages. In 2006, Nicolet began creating 3D films.
