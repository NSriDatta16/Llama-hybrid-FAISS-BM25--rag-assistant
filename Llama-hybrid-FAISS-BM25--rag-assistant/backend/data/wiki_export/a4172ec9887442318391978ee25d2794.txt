In mathematics, a sequence of vectors (xn) in a Hilbert space  is called a Riesz sequence if there exist constants  such that

for all sequences of scalars  (an) in the ℓp space ℓ2.  A Riesz sequence is called a Riesz basis if

.

Alternatively, one can define the Riesz basis as a family of the form , where  is an orthonormal basis for  and  is a bounded bijective operator.

Paley-Wiener criterion 
Let  be an orthonormal basis for a Hilbert space  and let   be "close" to  in the sense that 

 

for some constant , , and arbitrary scalars   . Then  is a Riesz basis for . Hence, Riesz bases need not be orthonormal.

Theorems
If H is a finite-dimensional space, then every basis of H is a Riesz basis.

Let  be in the Lp space L2(R), let

and let  denote the Fourier transform of .  Define constants c and C with .  Then the following are equivalent:

The first of the above conditions is the definition for () to form a Riesz basis for the space it spans.
