The Langove () is a Sulemani-speaking Baloch tribe in Pakistani Balochistan, though other communities can be found in Punjab and Sindh. Most Langove speak the Sulemani dialect of the Balochi language, although some who live in proximity to Brahui tribes speak Brahui language. Three salient sub-tribal Langove identity-groups are the Meeranzai, Halizai and Shadizai.
