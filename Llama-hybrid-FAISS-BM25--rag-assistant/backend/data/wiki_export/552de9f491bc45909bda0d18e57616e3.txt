From 1918 he went to N. Sklifasovski Art Studio; in 1925-1939 – to Tbilisi Academy of Arts. The years spent in Moscow and Leningrad in the early 1930s had a great impact on the artist's professional development. From 1932 Sergo Kobuladze efficiently worked for the Tbilisi Kote Marjanishvili and Shota Rustaveli Theatres, Tbilisi Zakaria Paliashvili Opera and Ballet State Theatre and for Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. In 1938 Sergo Kobuladze started teaching activity in Tbilisi Academy of Arts, where he founded and headed the Department of Painting and in 1953-1958 he became the Rector of the State Academy of Arts. After many years of work, in 1961 he completed the iconic painted stage curtain (170 sq. m) for Zakaria Paliashvili Opera and Ballet State Theatre.
