Veøy is a former municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. It initially consisted of all of the present-day Vestnes Municipality, as well as the southern part of Molde Municipality and the northern part of Rauma Municipality. Vestnes Municipality was only part of Veøy for a few months in 1838 before it was made into a separate municipality. In 1964, the municipality was split between Molde and Rauma municipalities. Veøy Municipality was named after the island of Veøya, the administrative centre, where the main church for the municipality (Old Veøy Church) was located. There are no inhabitants on the island of Veøya (as of 2020).

History

Landslide
Just before 8:00 p.m. on 22 February 1756, a landslide with a volume of  — the largest known landslide in Norway in historic time — traveled at high speed from a height of  on the side of the mountain Tjellafjellet into the Langfjorden  from Veøy. The slide generated three mega-tsunamis in the immediate area in the Langfjorden and the Eresfjorden with heights of . Damaging waves reached Veøy, where, although reduced in size, they washed inland  above normal flood levels.

Municipality
The parish of Veøy was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The western district of Veøy was separated in the fall of 1838 to become Vestnes Municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the islands of Sekken and Veøya as well as the Nesjestranda district on the mainland north of the Langfjorden (with a total population of 756) were incorporated into the newly enlarged Molde Municipality. The remainder of Veøy on the south side of the Langfjorden and the Vågstranda area (population: 1,400) were merged with the small municipalities of Eid, Grytten, Hen, and Voll to form the new Rauma Municipality.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Veøya () since the first Veøy Church was built there and it was the religious center of the whole Romsdal region. The first element part is  which means "sanctuary" (Vé is a word that comes from German paganism). The last element is  which means "island". Thus, the name refers to it being a holy island. The name was historically spelled Veø.

Government
