In 1960, the United States FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, continued for an eleventh year to maintain a public list of the people it regarded as the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.

As 1960 began, seven of the ten places on the list remained filled by these elusive long-time fugitives, then still at large:

 1950 #14 (ten years), Frederick J. Tenuto remained at large
 1952 #36 (eight years), James Eddie Diggs remained at large
 1954 #78 (six years), David Daniel Keegan remained at large
 1956 #97 (four years), Eugene Francis Newman remained at large
 1958 #107 (two years), Angelo Luigi Pero process dismissed December 2, 1960
 1959 #112 (one year), Edwin Sanford Garrison arrested September 9, 1960
 1959 #116 (eight months), Billy Owens Williams arrested March 4, 1960

This would be a very successful year for capturing fugitives from the Ten Most Wanted list, clearing space for new fugitives to be added to the list.  As a result, the FBI was able to add 22 new fugitives to the list over the course of the year, the highest since the 24 additions in the still (as of 2013) record year of 1953.
