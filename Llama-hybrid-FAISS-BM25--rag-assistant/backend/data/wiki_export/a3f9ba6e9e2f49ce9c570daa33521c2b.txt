History 

In medieval times, the area was within the heartland of the Khalaj tribe. The Khalji dynasty of India originated from this city. Many of the Khalaj were Pashtunized, transforming into the Ghilji tribe of Pashtuns.

A political mission came through the city April 16, 1857, en route to Kandahar to broker a new treaty of friendship between the British government at Peshawar and the Amir of Kabul.  The party was greeted by a group sent out by the heir-apparent to welcome them and check on the party's supplies.  Two companies of infantry were formed so the British could inspect the troops.  Afterwards, a shura was held.

Sher Ali Khan captured the city on January 22, 1867.  In the battle, he lost a son, Mahomed Ali, killed in single combat by his uncle.  His uncle was subsequently killed.

American reconstruction efforts 
In an effort to bring economic development to the area, Zabul province's first airstrip was built just outside the city in 2006.  It is a dirt runway.  The first flight brought in supplies for Provincial Reconstruction Team Zabul and other organizations trying to rebuild the area.  Three years later, a girls school was built to attempt to improve education in the area.  An initial school supply and prayer mat donation was made, and regular book drops and school supply donations were made until the PRT left in 2013.  Clean water programs around the city improved the availability of clean water sources.  In 2009, efforts were completed to improve the water system at the old Qalat City Hospital to bring clean drinking water to patients there.

Not all the reconstruction efforts were successful, however.  In 2006, construction began on a new economic district for the city.  Meant to be an area of commerce and development, ten million dollars and three years later, most of the buildings are unoccupied, unusable either due to lack of the skills to maintain the buildings or due to a lack of need for the building.  Zabul province's governor refused to move into the new house, citing the lack of security.

Anne Smedinghoff, a 25-year-old U.S. diplomat, was killed by a suicide car inside the city in the spring of 2013.
