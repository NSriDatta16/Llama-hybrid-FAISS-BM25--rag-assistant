Obuasi Municipal Assembly is one of the forty-three districts in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger Adansi West District in 1988, until part of the district was split off to create Obuasi Municipal District on 15 December 2003 (effectively 17 February 2004); whose remaining parts had been absorbed into parts of Adansi North District and Adansi South District respectively. Later, the eastern part of the district was split off to create Obuasi East District on 15 March 2018; thus the remaining part has been retained as Obuasi Municipal Assembly.
