Portslade railway station (in full, Portslade & West Hove station) is a railway station located in Portslade-by-Sea in the city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, England, but located on the western fringes of the village of Aldrington (a part commonly known as 'West Hove'). It is  down the line from Brighton.

Services 
All services at Portslade are operated by Southern using  EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
 2 tph to  via 
 2 tph to  (1 of these calls at all stations and 1 does not stop at )
 2 tph to 
 1 tph to 
 1 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by a small number of direct trains between Brighton and Littlehampton, as well as a single peak hour service per day between  and Littlehampton.

Future developments 
The Thameslink Programme contains proposals to extend the Thameslink network to various additional routes in southern England; one of these would be the section of the West Coastway line between Hove and Littlehampton, with services running via the Cliftonville Curve from the Brighton Main Line. This will see services that currently terminate at London Bridge continuing through Central London and north wards via the Midland Main Line or East Coast Main Line to destinations such as Luton or Cambridge. This however is not imminent, a Department for Transport whitepaper states only that "the Thameslink Programme will be completed by the end of 2015" and that "interim outputs will be delivered by the end of 2011". This was eventually implemented in 2017, with a single peak hour service from Littlehampton to Bedford. This service was cut back to London Bridge in January 2023, before the service was transferred to Southern in May 2023.
