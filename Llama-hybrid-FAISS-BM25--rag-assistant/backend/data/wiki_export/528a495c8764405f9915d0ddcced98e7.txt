Can't Get a Date is a documentary-style reality show on VH1 and Logo.

The show takes a variety of individuals from New York City who feel that they have personal issues that are holding them back from finding romance. An anonymous host, producer Stefan Springman, guides them through lifestyle changes  physical, emotional, and behavioral  to help them improve themselves and ultimately become more "dateable".

As VH1 states on its website, Can't Get a Date "explores the problems of such people and teaches them the skills to find love in an honest, amusing, and unique way".

The working title of the program was "Crushed Out", and the program was co-created by Stefan Springman, Toby Barraud, and Manny Kivowitz.

The final original episode of Can't Get A Date aired on June 28, 2006. The series run is available free to watch on the Logo website. It was also licensed exclusively to Netflix as part of an ongoing licensing agreement between the network and the company; it can be watched by Netflix account holders via their website, and an exclusive DVD (by "Red Envelope Entertainment") can be rented through Netflix. It contains only the gay and lesbian episodes.
