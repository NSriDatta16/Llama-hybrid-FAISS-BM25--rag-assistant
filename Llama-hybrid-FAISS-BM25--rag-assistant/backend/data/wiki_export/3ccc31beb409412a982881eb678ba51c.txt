Þóra Magnúsdóttir (born c. 1100; Old Norse: ; Modern Icelandic: ; Modern Norwegian: ) was a daughter of King Magnus III of Norway (Magnus 3 Olavsson Berrføtt).

Þóra married an Icelandic man and moved to Iceland. Her husband, Loftur Sæmundsson was a chieftain of Oddi at Rangárvellir in the south part of Iceland. He was  a member of the Oddaverjar clan and son of Icelandic priest and scholar Sæmundur fróði Sigfússon. Their son Jón Loftsson was later chieftain at Oddi.  

Descendants of Loftur and Þóra included Þuríður Sturludóttir (born c. 1228), who married  Hrafn Oddsson (born c. 1225), a descendant of Skallagrímur Kveldúlfsson (Skalla-Grímr), the father of skald  Egill Skallagrímsson. With the birth of Jón korpur Hrafnsson, the feuding clans of the Fairhair  and Skalla-Grímr dynasties were united.
