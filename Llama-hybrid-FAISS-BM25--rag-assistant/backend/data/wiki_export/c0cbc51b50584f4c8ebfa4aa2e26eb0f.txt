Writing

The Destroyer
The first Destroyer novel to which Mullaney contributed was #88: The Ultimate Death; he then went on to become the sole writer of the series for issues #111-131. When the series moved from Gold Eagle to Tor Books, he and series co-creator Warren Murphy shared coauthor credit on The Destroyer, beginning May 2007.

Sony Pictures has announced that Mullaney has been hired, along with Jim Uhls, to co-write the script for a new Destroyer movie, which is currently in development.

Other work
Mullaney has two series of his own.  The Red Menace is an adventure series that centers on Patrick "Podge" Becket, a retired communist-fighter and secret agent from the 1950s who returns to crime-fighting in the 1970s, aided by his friend and partner Dr. Thaddeus Wainwright.  The first novel, Red and Buried, was released on September 15, 2011 to mostly positive reviews. The paperback of Red and Buried was issued in paperback by Moonstone Books in 2013.

Four more E-books in the Red Menace series have been released, Drowning In Red Ink, Red the Riot Act, A Red Letter Day, and Red on the Menu.  In 2021, Bold Venture Press brought out the first three works in paperback and will most likely bring the rest out as well.  A sixth and seventh are listed.
