The temple's exterior totals , four ordinance rooms and six sealing rooms.

Two LDS Church presidents hold ties to Toronto. John Taylor and his wife immigrated to Toronto in 1832, while Monson served as president of the church's Canadian Mission, headquartered in Toronto, from 1959 to 1962.

In 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Toronto Ontario Temple was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
