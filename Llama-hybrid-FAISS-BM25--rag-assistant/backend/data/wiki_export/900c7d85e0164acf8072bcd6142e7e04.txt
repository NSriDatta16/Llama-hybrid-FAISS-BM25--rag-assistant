Bangalow is a small town in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia in Byron Shire. The town is  north of Sydney and  south of Brisbane, just off the Pacific Highway. The town's name appears to have been derived from an Aboriginal word, "Bangalla", said to mean 'a low hill' or 'a kind of palm tree'.

History
Bangalow's historic streetscape, monthly market and proximity to the popular tourist resort of Byron Bay has increased its appeal as a tourist destination. Timber cutters established a camp on the banks of Byron Creek in the 1840s but it was not until the 1880s that a town appeared on the site. The town was known as Bangaloe until 1907, when the modern spelling came into use.

In recent years Bangalow has become a pleasant stop for holiday-makers and day-trippers as its main street is lined with modern cafes and boutique-shops. Organic produce grown nearby is a regular feature in the cafes, in particular the Byron Bay coffee-beans are a popular purchase.

Bangalow Public School was first built in 1884. In 1925, a 4 classroom brick building block was built. The Bangalow Uniting Church was rebuilt in the early 1900s after a tornado blew down the original (Methodist) church. The church congregation is still active.

Events
Bangalow is also home to the Bangalow Billy Cart Derby, which is held each year. It is a fun day, when the school has its fundraiser "The Mad Hatter's Teaparty".
