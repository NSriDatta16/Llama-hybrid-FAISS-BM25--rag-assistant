Pittsburgh Pirates
Neagle was dealt to the Pittsburgh Pirates during spring training in , and became a full-time starter for the Pirates in . The following season, Neagle posted a 13–8 record with a 3.43 ERA and became the ace of a mediocre Pittsburgh staff.

On August 27, 1996, he pitched eight innings giving up only two runs to the first place Atlanta Braves.

Remaining with the Braves in , Neagle had his best season, going 20–5 with a 2.97 ERA.

In Game 4 of the 1997 National League Championship Series, Neagle pitched a complete-game shutout.

Neagle's 16–11 record and 3.55 ERA in  were still solid numbers, but the emergence of Kevin Millwood made him expendable and he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds after the season.

New York Yankees
The playoff-bound New York Yankees traded prospects Drew Henson, Jackson Melián and Ed Yarnall to acquire Neagle along with outfielder Mike Frank on July 12, 2000.

Colorado Rockies, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and legal troubles
In December 2000, the Colorado Rockies signed Neagle and fellow left-hander Mike Hampton to expensive contracts. Neagle's contract was for five years and $51 million, and his 17–19 record and 5.31 ERA over the  and  seasons spelled disaster for the Rockies. Due to injuries, Neagle only started seven games in . He went 2–4 with a 7.90 ERA, pitching what was to be his last Major League game on July 20, 2003.

Neagle missed the  season due to ligament and elbow surgeries. Then, in late November 2004, a Lakewood, Colorado, police officer ticketed him for soliciting a woman for oral sex. Less than a week later, the Rockies canceled the final year of his lucrative contract, citing a morals clause in his contract. The incident ultimately led to the end of Neagle's marriage.

He signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before the 2005 season, but did not play due to injury.
