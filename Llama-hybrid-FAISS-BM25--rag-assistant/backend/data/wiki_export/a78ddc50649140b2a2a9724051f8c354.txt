"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)" is a song by the American rap rock band Limp Bizkit from their album Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. It was released as the second and third single simultaneously, along with "My Generation", on September 5, 2000. The song peaked at number 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving the band their highest-charting single in the US, and remained on the chart for 17 weeks. Internationally, "Rollin'" topped the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom and peaked within the top 10 of the charts in Austria, Finland, Germany, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden.

"Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle)", was the original version of the song, although sometimes it is referred to as a hip-hop remix of "Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)". It features hip-hop artists DMX, Method Man and Redman, and was produced by Swizz Beatz. It is included as the second-to-last track on the Chocolate Starfish album. This version is also featured on the soundtrack to the 2001 film The Fast and the Furious.

Writing and recording
Rollin was created through a collaborative effort with hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz. Although sometimes referred to as a hip-hop remix, the Urban Assault Vehicle version of the song was actually the first version that was created. Fred and Swizz Beatz worked together to create this version and when it was presented to the band there was some initial frustration. The band felt the song might work better as a rock song, which led to the creation of the Air Raid Vehicle version of the song. Wes Borland would later state "we liked both versions so much that that's what it ended up being, two versions: a hip-hop version of the song and a rock version of the song."

Music video
The music video was filmed in September 2000 atop the South Tower of the original World Trade Center in New York City. The introduction features Ben Stiller and Stephen Dorff mistaking Fred Durst for the valet and giving him the keys to their Bentley Azure, out front of The Roxy Hotel. Also making a cameo is break dancer Mr. Wiggles. The rest of the video has several cuts to Durst and his bandmates hanging out of the Bentley as they drive about Manhattan. The song Ben Stiller is playing at the beginning is "My Generation" from the same album. The video also features scenes of Fred Durst with five girls dancing in a room. The video was filmed around the same time as the film Zoolander, which explains Stiller and Dorff's appearance. Fred Durst has a small cameo in that film.

The "Rollin'" video received the award for Best Rock Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. On September 10, 2001 (the day before the Twin Towers were destroyed in the September 11 attacks), Limp Bizkit received a letter and a fruit basket from the Port Authority of New York City, thanking them for featuring the twin towers in the video and congratulating the band after the video had won the VMA for Best Rock Video at the VMAs on September 6.

About the music video, Durst said: "It felt like we just started to poke fun at what people thought we were and embrace that. That’s why we made the Rollin’ video. There were red caps everywhere, and look at Wes at the beginning of the video with his grills in. How the hell did people not realize we weren’t being serious? We thought it was hilarious."

In 2022, Louder Sound and Kerrang ranked the song number eight and number nine, respectively, on their lists of Limp Bizkit's greatest songs.
