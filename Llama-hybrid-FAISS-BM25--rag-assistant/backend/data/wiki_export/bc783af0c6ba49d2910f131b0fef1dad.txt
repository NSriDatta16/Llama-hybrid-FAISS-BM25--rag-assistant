Hub () is a city and capital of the Hub District in Balochistan, Pakistan. It is the 49th largest city of Pakistan by population according to the 2017 census, and is also Balochistan's fourth-largest city. Hub is an industrial city and its original name was Hub Chowki because once there was a police and customs check post (which is known as chowki in Urdu), named Nakahi. After the development of factories and many other industries, the town was renamed to Hub. Hub is one of the largest industrial centres of Balochistan, and because of its proximity to Karachi, it is becoming a commuter town of the Karachi metropolitan area.

History 
The Kalmati Malik Principality of Hub-Malir Following the downfall of the Sultanate of Makran (mid 12th-early 14th century, A.D.)" the succeeding Baloch state of Kalmat (14th to mid-16th century) flourished in the coastal region extending from Pasni southward most probably as far as the Hub river.

Demographics
The majority of the population is Muslim, while there are small Hindu and Christian minorities. Increased commercialization in this area has led to many social, political and hygienic problems. The worsening state of roads and streets in the area has made everyday life difficult. Roads are too busy as the area serves as a hub between Balochistan and Karachi, that is one of the main reasons behind the lack of development in this area. Presence of political parties usually lead to deteriorating law and order situations, affecting the life and commerce in many ways and eventually leading to the decline of national economy.
