Tourism 

With its rain forests, volcanoes, hills and valleys lined with rows upon rows of coffee plants and sugar cane, the Orosi region offers some of the richest scenery to be found in Costa Rica. But the region is also rich in history and contains a number of monuments to the past, including a colonial capital founded in 1563 and archeological excavations that date back to 1000 B.C. Although this area was one of the first in the country to be settled, it has been one of the last to be developed for tourism.

A few kilometers away, at the southern end of the valley, the road ends and the Tapantí National Park begins. This park covers about 600 km2 and forms the northernmost section of a massive collection of nature parks that extends into Panamá (the largest of which is the La Amistad International Park). As a result, wildlife abounds. However, access is difficult and largely restricted apart from a few kilometers of easy trails. The abundance of birds makes it a popular place for ornithology studies. Part of the reason for the abundant growth is the heavy rainfall, which ranges up to 7,000mm (275 inches) in the mountains. It is the drinkable water source that supplies much of the metropolitan area. Lake Cachí lies to the northeast.
