Woolton Picture House (also known as Woolton Cinema) is a privately owned cinema in the Woolton area of Liverpool, England. It is the only remaining single-screen cinema in the city, and is popular with cinema enthusiasts because of its old-fashioned atmosphere. The music of Mantovani plays before the main programme and in the traditional halfway interval, during which ice cream can be bought from usherettes.

It was purchased in 1992 by David Wood, the grandson of Liverpool cinema pioneer John Frederick Wood. Wood died on 12 June 2006 leading to the cinema's closure on 3 September. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was the last film to be shown. In 2007, a group of entrepreneurs purchased the cinema and re-opened it on 29 March 2007 with a screening of The Queen.

The 2020 coronavirus pandemic led to the closure of the establishment, but a crowd-funding effort on Go Fund Me has raised £20,000, and the owners have suspended redundancies whilst they evaluate the availability of grants from the BFI and other sources.
