The Love Ranch is a legal, licensed brothel located about  east of Carson City, Nevada in the unincorporated town of Mound House, in Lyon County, at 95 Kit Kat Drive, also known as The Love Ranch North.

It sits along the southeast side of the cul de sac at the end of Kit Kat Drive, just off Highway 50 (Lincoln Highway), approximately 1.2 mile (1.6 km) from the Moonlite BunnyRanch. Also on the cul de sac are two other brothels the Kit Kat Guest Ranch and the Sagebrush Ranch; and Madam Suzette's Red Light Cabaret Strip Club. The cul de sac is collectively known as the Madam Suzette and Dennis Hof's Red Light District.

History
Formerly known under several variations of the name Kitty's, this brothel was owned by Dennis Hof until his death in 2018. Hof is best known as the star of HBO's Cathouse and proprietor of the nearby Moonlite BunnyRanch.  Hof reportedly renamed this operation in 2004 to better take advantage of the "BunnyRanch brand name", which he has heavily promoted. In June 2008, this house was again renamed, this time as The Love Ranch in order to build a unique identity for the brothel. It is sometimes referred to as The Love Ranch North, to differentiate it from Love Ranch Vegas.
