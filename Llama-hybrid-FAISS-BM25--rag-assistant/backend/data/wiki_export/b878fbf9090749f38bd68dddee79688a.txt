Burnside railway station serves the Burnside and Blairbeth areas of the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, Greater Glasgow, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is located on the Newton branch of the Cathcart Circle Lines, which has been electrified since 1962 by British Railways. This is the busiest railway station on the Newton branch.

History 
The station was opened by the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway on 1 August 1904. Later taken over by the Caledonian Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the 1923 Grouping and subsequently the Scottish Region of British Railways at nationalisation in 1948.  B.R electrified the line through the station in 1962, when the section beyond  was closed - since that time, all services have run to/from Glasgow only, though it became possible to travel there via both sides of the Circle following track alterations in the Carthcart area carried out as part of the modernisation work.

Facilities 
Access to this station is by one of two railway bridges and as a result there is no disabled access to trains from here. A single waiting room serves both platforms. The ticket office is only open on Mondays to Saturdays. Customer information screens are also available at this station. A help point is available, like on every other ScotRail station in Glasgow. Automatic announcements have recently been fitted at this station as well as all the stations on the Cathcart Circle.  There is no dedicated car park, but six cycle storage places are available.
