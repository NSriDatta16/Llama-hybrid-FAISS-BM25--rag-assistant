Plot

Set in Washington, D.C., this film documents an attempted power grab by White House Chief of Staff Jacob Conrad. Bobby Bishop is a special aide to the President of the United States who finds out about a plot to assassinate the President from a former professor.

He recruits his journalist friend Amanda Givens to help him uncover the mystery and stop the assassination.

Cast

Reception
Shadow Conspiracy was panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 3% based on reviews from 29 critics, and an average rating of 3.3/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: "Rather than exciting audiences with a thrilling race against time, Shadow Conspiracy suggests there may be a secret cabal duping talented actors into selecting woefully deficient scripts." The film did not fare well at the box office, grossing a little over $2 million domestically.
