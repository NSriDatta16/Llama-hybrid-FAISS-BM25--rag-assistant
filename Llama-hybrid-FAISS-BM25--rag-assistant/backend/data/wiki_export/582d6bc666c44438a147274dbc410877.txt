Introduction 

The school was started in 1985 in rented premises with 18 children with classes Nursery to III. This was made possible by the  support of Mr. B. Ratnakar, the then chairman of Canara Bank who made sure that the loan was sanctioned for starting the school. In 1986 the No Objection Certificate was obtained from the Government of Karnataka and the strength of the school grew to 30. In 1987, the school was granted Provisional Affiliation by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. Then began the search for a piece of land. After a lot of wrangling and struggle the present civic amenity site was allotted to the school.
