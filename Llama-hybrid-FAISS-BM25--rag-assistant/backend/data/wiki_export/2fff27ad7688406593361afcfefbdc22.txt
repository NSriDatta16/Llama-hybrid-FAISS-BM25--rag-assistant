Life and career
Limbaugh was born on December 11, 1952, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to Mildred Carolyn "Millie" (n√©e Armstrong) and Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Jr. Limbaugh's paternal grandfather was Missouri state representative, lawyer, and United States Ambassador Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr.

Following high school, Limbaugh attended Southeast Missouri State University in 1971 and 1972, transferring to the University of Missouri, where he graduated cum laude with a bachelor's degree in political science.  Limbaugh then went on to law school at Missouri where he received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Missouri in 1978. He also served in the National Guard for six years.  He has written columns that are carried by Creators Syndicate, Townhall.com, WorldNetDaily and Jewish World Review. In addition to his legal and writing work, Limbaugh also works as an agent for several conservative talk radio hosts.

Limbaugh was chosen by Christian authors Norman Geisler and Frank Turek to write the foreword to their book I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist (Crossway, 2004). In the book, Limbaugh states that he became a Christian after years of being a skeptic and that he now has a strong interest in Christian apologetics. Limbaugh describes himself as "an evangelical Christian".

Limbaugh and his wife, Lisa, have five children. Limbaugh has written several books, some of which have been bestsellers, such as Crimes Against Liberty, which was The New York Times''' Non-fiction best seller for two weeks in 2010.
