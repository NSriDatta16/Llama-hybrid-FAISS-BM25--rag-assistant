Zijdewind (West Frisian: Sidewind) is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon, and lies about 8Â km north of Heerhugowaard.

The village was first mentioned in 1421 as Nuwe Nyedorper Zydwijnde, and means "sidewards located dike". Zijdewind started as a peat excavation village. In 1652, a church was built, but was decommissioned. It was used as a farm and often mockingly called the cow church. In 1970, it was demolished to make way for a roundabout.

The statistical area "Zijdewind", which also can include the surrounding countryside, has a population of around 310.
