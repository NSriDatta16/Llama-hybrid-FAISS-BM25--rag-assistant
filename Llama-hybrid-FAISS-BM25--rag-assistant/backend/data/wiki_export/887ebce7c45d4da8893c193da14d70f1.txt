Activism during the Bush administration

NSA domestic surveillance
In May 2006, Young signed on as a plaintiff in a suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against AT&T, alleging that the telecommunications company provided its customers' phone records to the United States government without a court-issued warrant. Young joined historian and author Studs Terkel who was also a plaintiff in the case. This suit was part of the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, during which it was reported that the National Security Agency was maintaining a database of phone calls placed domestically in the United States.

Medical savings accounts
Young is an outspoken opponent of medical savings account (MSAs), a public health policy promoted by President George W. Bush. Young calls them a "scam on American patients and taxpayers," and "based on the incorrect assumption that Americans are addicts for health care and that if there isn’t a dollar barrier, they’ll overconsume. In fact, Americans get fewer doctors’ visits than people in countries with universal health care."

Illinois Sports Facilities Authority Scandal
In November, 2012 at age of 89, Young was the last-minute appointment of his long-time political associate Illinois Governor Patrick Quinn, to displace the Latino incumbent. Young agreed to the appointment for the sole purpose of voting to install a young white aide of the governor to the directorship of the state sports authority. The governor's candidate, a former television reporter, won the position with Young's support in a contentious vote of the authority's board despite her demonstrated history of financial mismanagement including filing for personal bankruptcy due to excessive credit card expenditures to luxury retailers such as Bloomingdales. Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his appointees had sought to appoint the African American former CFO of Sara Lee Corp, a Yale graduate and criticized the move to install an individual whose incompetence could subject Illinois' taxpayers to significant financial liability Young stayed on the board until 2015.
