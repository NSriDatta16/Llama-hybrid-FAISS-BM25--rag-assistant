The Remix Album is an album released by Milli Vanilli in 1990. Due to the significant differences between the original Milli Vanilli debut album, All or Nothing, and the North America-only Girl You Know It's True release, producer Frank Farian decided to repackage these previously unreleased songs in a remix album. The album peaked at number thirty-two in the US and was certified Gold by the RIAA in July 1990.

The songs that had been unreleased in the US are "Money", "Hush", "Can't You Feel My Love" and "Boy in the Tree". Most of the songs on this album are completely remixed from the version included on the group's European debut album.
