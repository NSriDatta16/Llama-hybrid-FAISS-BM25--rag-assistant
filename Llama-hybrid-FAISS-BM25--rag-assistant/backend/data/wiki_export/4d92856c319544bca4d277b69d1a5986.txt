Girl Trouble is a garage rock band formed in 1983, composed of three musicians from Tacoma, Washington and one from Spokane, Washington.

History 

The band played their first show in 1984, and signed to Olympia's K Records label soon afterwards, on which they released two singles ("Riverbed" and "Old Time Religion") in 1987. One of their recordings, "Gonna Find A Cave" written by Jimmy Radcliffe and Buddy Scott, made an appearance on the Sub Pop 200 compilation alongside tracks by Nirvana and Soundgarden.
Various albums followed on different independent labels. As a side project, guitarist Kahuna plays in a Sonics tribute band called New Original Sonic Sound, featuring members of Mudhoney and the Young Fresh Fellows.
