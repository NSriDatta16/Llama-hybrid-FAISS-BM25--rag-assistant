History 
Named for the first Union General to die in the Civil War, Nathaniel Lyon, the cemetery was established as part of Fort Lyon the first time in 1887. The fort was abandoned in 1897 and the remains buried in the cemetery were transferred to Fort McPherson National Cemetery in Nebraska. In 1906 the fort buildings were converted into a sanitarium to treat soldiers and prisoners of war with tuberculosis, and burials began in 1907. The cemetery was transferred to the National Cemetery system in 1973 to be managed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.
