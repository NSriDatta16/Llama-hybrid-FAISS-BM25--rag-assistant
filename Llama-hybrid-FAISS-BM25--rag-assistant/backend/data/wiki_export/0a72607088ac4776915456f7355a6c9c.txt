History 
Originally named "Monmouth Shopping Center", the Monmouth Mall opened on March 1, 1960, as a , 14-building, 50-store open-air center. The mall was built on what was then a farm owned by the Valentino Family of the nearby city of Long Branch, New Jersey. Original anchors of the mall consisted of Bamberger's (at that time a subsidiary of Macy's) and Montgomery Ward. After pulling out of New Jersey, Montgomery Ward became Alexander's in 1975. The mall was enclosed and expanded to its current size in 1975. The older section of the mall continued to have one level while the new expansion included two levels that were anchored by Abraham & Straus, Hahne's and JCPenney as of 1975.

In 1987, the mall was renovated. The renovation brought in new lighting, new flooring, and new glass and chrome handrails along the second level. The renovation also removed the in-floor planters and replaced them with movable planters. The renovation also closed off the entrance near the former arcade on the Wyckoff Road side of the old wing; and raised the lowered seating areas in front of the anchors.

Ashley Tisdale was discovered at the mall in 1989 as a three-year-old.

In 1994â€“1996, the mall was expanded to include an elevator and a food court (modeled after a Jersey Shore theme) including 1920s style beach photos wrapped around the columns in the older section of the mall, as well as Nobody Beats the Wiz, a new 15-screen Loews Theatres (now AMC). Old Navy to replace the closed Caldor. The mall also saw minor cosmetic changes that consisted of replacing black with sky blue in the color schemes through painting and retiling, as well as new lighting along the pillars.

Through the years, Monmouth Mall has seen many different anchors that have come and gone, however, JCPenney was built by themselves in 1976 and remains to this day. In 1987, the Bamberger's brand was eliminated and the store was renamed for its parent corporation, Macy's. Anchor changes consisted of Caldor replacing Alexander's in 1986, Macy's replacing the former store Bamberger's in 1987, Lord & Taylor replacing the former store Hahne's in 1990, Stern's replacing Abraham & Straus in 1995 and Boscov's replacing Stern's in 2001. In 2010, Planet Fitness opened at Monmouth Mall. However, after many years at the mall, Planet Fitness announced plans to close it's Monmouth Mall location and relocate to a new store in Shrewsbury in 2022.

Monmouth Mall went through a significant expansion in 2009. In mid-2010, cosmetic renovations started at the mall including new tile, paint, lighting, and a complete overhaul of the food court. The renovations lasted until summer 2011.

In 2012, Vornado Realty Trust announced plans to sell its portfolio of enclosed shopping malls. In August 2015, Vornado's fifty percent stake and management in the Monmouth Mall was sold to co-owner Kushner Companies for $38 million.

Redevelopment
In February 2016, Monmouth Mall owner Kushner Companies announced conceptual plans to redevelop the mall into a pedestrian-friendly "live, work and play" development at a cost of approximately $500 million. The development, which would be renamed the "Monmouth Town Center" was proposed to include residential apartments, a hotel, retail space, entertainment, and dining options. The proposal also included an outdoor plaza, green spaces, and a biker- and pedestrian- friendly streetscape. The residential component was intended to include one and two bedroom apartment units to minimize impacts on local traffic and public school systems. Kushner Companies then-CEO Jared Kushner noted the struggle face by traditional enclosed shopping malls in the 21st Century and consumer trends of the Millennial generation as catalysts behind the redevelopment.

On April 27 of that year, a public meeting was held in a local middle school gymnasium where Eatontown's mayor Dennis Connelly and the Borough Council spoke out against a zoning change that would allow the expansion of the mall.  Several borough residents also spoke out against the redevelopment, and Kushner announced the abandonment of the project at the same meeting.

A proposal issued in January 2018 named "The Heights At Monmouth" suggested the demolition of the two-story wing that includes Boscov's and covers . It also proposed additions that would total  and bring the mall's total gross leasable area to . During this time, Kushner partnered with Rouse Properties (now Brookfield Properties) for the redevelopment. The redevelopment was approved on July 16, 2018. The new plans include opening up the two story mall corridor and creating new outdoor corridors. The plan also includes provisions for the addition of 700 residential apartment units, of which 88 will be designated affordable housing.

On August 1, 2023 it was revealed that one of the first retailers for the updated mall would be Whole Foods. This location is planning to open where the Barnes & Noble is located at the mall, with the bookstore still planning to stay in operation at this site but relocating to a different section. These changes, along with proposals to create apartments and green areas, are all parts of the new plan to turn the mall into an improved commercial area dubbed "Monmouth Square." In April 2023, the local government of Eatontown officially agreed to these plans, which will start at the end of 2023 with the destruction of empty sections of the mall, including the location of Monmouth Mall's former Lord & Taylor. The proposed residential section, which includes the construction of apartments, will eventually become known as "Monmouth Village."
