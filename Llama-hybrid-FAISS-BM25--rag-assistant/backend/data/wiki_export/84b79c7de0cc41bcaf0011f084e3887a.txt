The Russian Basketball Super League 1, or Super Liga 1, (), formerly known as the Russian Basketball Super League A or the Russian Basketball Super Liga A, is a men's professional basketball league that was the pre-eminent league of Russian professional basketball until 2010. Currently, it is the second-tier division of the Russian professional basketball pyramid. The league is run by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF).

History
After being the first-tier division of Russian basketball, from its first season in 1991–92, the Super League A was relegated to being the second-tier division of Russian basketball after the 2009–10 season, and was replaced with a different first-tier league, starting with the 2010–11 season of the Russian Professional Basketball League (PBL). The successor league to the Super League 1 was not controlled by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF), like the Super League 1 is, but by a separate body named the Professional Basketball League (PBL).

From the 2010–11 season onward, the Super League A and Super League B (the previous second division of the Russian basketball pyramid) divisions were united into a single league that serves as the second tier of Russian basketball, named the Super League 1. The 2010–11 season featured 11 clubs.
