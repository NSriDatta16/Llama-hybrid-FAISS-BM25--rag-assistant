It was known as Lycopolis or Lykopolis (Greek: ) in the Antiquity, an ancient town in the Sebennytic nome in Lower Egypt.

History 
From its appellation, the city was apparently founded by a colony of Osirian priests from the town of Lycopolis in Upper Egypt.

The city is mentioned in the inscription on the Rosetta Stone. It was besieged by Ptolemy V during civil strife:
He went to the stronghold of Shekan [which was] fortified by the enemy with every device... he laid siege to the stronghold in question with a wall around its exterior on account of the enemies who were within it who had inflicted great wrong upon Egypt, having abandoned the path of duty to Pharaoh and duty [to the] gods.
The king "seized the stronghold in question by force in a short time" having cut off the water supply to the fortress and taken control of the irrigation canals.
