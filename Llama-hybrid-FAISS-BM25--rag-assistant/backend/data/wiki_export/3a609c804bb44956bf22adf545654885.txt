Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting the uptake of zinc through the inner lining of the bowel, the mucous membrane. It is characterized by inflammation of the skin (dermatitis) around bodily openings (periorificial) and the tips of fingers and toes (acral), hair loss (alopecia), and diarrhea. It can also be related to deficiency of zinc due to other, i.e. congenital causes.

Other names for acrodermatitis enteropathica include Brandt syndrome and Danboltâ€“Cross syndrome.

Signs and symptoms
Individuals with acrodermatitis enteropathica may present with the following:
 Blistering of skin
 Dry skin
 Emotional lability
 Glossitis
 Pustule
Alopecia (loss of hair from the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes) may occur. Skin lesions may be secondarily infected by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus or fungi such as Candida albicans. These skin lesions are accompanied by diarrhea.

Genetics

Acrodermatitis enteropathica, in terms of genetics, indicates that a mutation of the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8 q24.3 is responsible for the disorder. The SLC39A4 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that serves as a zinc uptake protein. The features of the disease usually start manifesting as an infant is weaned from breast milk. Zinc is very important as it is involved in the function of approximately 100 enzymes in the human body.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of an individual with acrodermatitis enteropathica includes each of the following:
 Plasma zinc level (lab)
 Light microscopy (skin biopsy)
 Electron microscopy (histology)

Treatment
Acrodermatitis enteropathica without treatment is fatal, and affected individuals may die within a few years. There is no cure for the condition. Treatment includes lifelong dietary zinc supplementation.
