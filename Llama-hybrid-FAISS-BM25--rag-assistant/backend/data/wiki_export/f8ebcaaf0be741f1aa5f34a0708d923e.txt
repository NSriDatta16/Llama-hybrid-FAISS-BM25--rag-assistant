"Curbside Prophet" is a song by Jason Mraz. It was released as part of his first major studio album, Waiting for My Rocket to Come, which is one of the lyrics of this song. Mraz credits rap group Jurassic 5 as being part of the inspiration for the story of his travels across the U.S. in pursuit of a music career.

The song was remixed with additional and modified lyrics for the 2004 film New York Minute. The song's name was changed to "Curbside Prophet '04" on the New York Minute soundtrack.

There was no music video filmed for the song other than a live performance recorded at the Eagles Ballroom with John Popper of Blues Traveler on blues harp. This live recording was used for the song's music video.
