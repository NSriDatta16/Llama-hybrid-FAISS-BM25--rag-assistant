was a Japanese video game and software developer founded in October 1983 by Kazuyuki Fukushima. The company had several video game divisions including: Wolf Team, Laser Soft, Renovation Game (Japanese publishing division), Renovation Products (North America publishing division), Riot, Commseed, and Telenet Jr. Telenet Japan's North American subsidiary, Renovation Products, was acquired by Sega of America in 1993. With debt of , the company ceased operating in late September 2007 and closed its doors on October 25. Sunsoft acquired Telenet's entire software library in December 2009, citing plans to remake or re-release (via Virtual Console) the old titles. The Japanese company Edia acquired Telenet's catalogue from City Connection in January 2020.

Riot
The Riot division came into existence in 1991 when Telenet Japan was expanding in the country.

However, because Telenet was starting to lose sales in 1993, the company went through extensive restructuring which resulted in the closing of a few subsidiaries. Some staff employed at Laser Soft and Riot were transferred to another subsidiary, Wolfteam. The same year, several key developers of the PC Engine games Tenshi no Uta I & II left Riot to found Media.Vision and work on a new RPG franchise, Wild Arms.

Riot was also known for employing graphic artist and later game director Eiji Kikuchi, as well as music composer Michiko Naruke.
