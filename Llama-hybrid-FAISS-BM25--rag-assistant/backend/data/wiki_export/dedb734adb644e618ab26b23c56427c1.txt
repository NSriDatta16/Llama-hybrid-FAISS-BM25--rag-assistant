The Catholic High School League (CHSL) is a school athletic conference based in Detroit, Michigan, led by director Victor Michaels. Most member schools are also members of the Michigan High School Athletic Association (MHSAA), the governing body for Michigan scholastic sports, except for the five schools from Toledo, which are members of the Ohio High School Athletic Association. Unlike many similar leagues, the CHSL governs secondary, middle, and elementary sports for most of the parochial schools in the Detroit area. Most league schools are Catholic, but there are other religious denominations as well. Every school in the CHSL is a private school. In 2019, the CHSL council voted to rename the AB/ Division I/II championship to the Bishop division championship, and the CD/ Division III/IV championship to the Cardinal Division championship.

Football Championships

In 1926, Detroit Holy Redeemer and Detroit St. Leo faced each other in the first football game to determine the champion of the Detroit Parochial League (later the CHSL). Holy Redeemer won that game 14-9.

The game has been played every year since 1926 under various names, with Detroit Catholic Central winning twenty-eight football league championship games, the most of any school in league history.

Starting in 1948, the league championship game was called "The Soup Bowl", as the Capuchin Soup kitchen became the benefactor of some of the proceeds from the game.
The Soup Bowl game was always played at University of Detroit Stadium. 
After the affiliation with the Capuchins ended in 1967 the game was called the "Charity Bowl" and since 1971 the "Prep Bowl".

The Prep Bowl was played at the Pontiac Silverdome and, since 2002, at Ford Field.  The Prep Bowl today also involves the Detroit Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) for Catholic elementary schools as well as games within the high school divisions of the CHSL.

Prep Bowl facts:

Through 2015, the winningest high schools in Prep Bowl history, regardless of divisions, are:
Bloomfield Hills Brother Rice (twenty-three A-B Division, Central-AA Division and Wildcard wins)
Detroit Catholic Central (twenty A-B Division, Central-AA Division and Wildcard wins)
Waterford Our Lady of the Lakes (fourteen C-D Division and Wildcard wins)

Operation Friendship

In 1947, the Detroit City League boys basketball champion and the Detroit Parochial League boys basketball champion met at Olympia Stadium in Detroit to play for the first time to determine who would wear the crown as the Detroit City Basketball Champions. The game between Detroit Miller High School and Detroit St. Joseph High School drew so much interest it sold out Olympia Stadium, with a capacity of 11,563 and in so doing established a state record for attendance at a high school basketball game. 
This was the first of what would, in later years, become known as the Operation Friendship Championship pitting the best of the Detroit Public School League against the Catholic High School League. 
At the end of the evening, the Detroit Miller Trojans defeated the Detroit St. Joseph Blue Jays 47-34 to claim the first ever Detroit City Basketball High School Championship.
Since that game, the Detroit Public School League champions and the Detroit Catholic High School League champions have met nearly every year to determine the Detroit City Champions. In later years, the game would become known as the Operation Friendship Championship.  The game has been played at University of Detroit's Calihan Hall (formerly Memorial Hall) virtually every year, although Cobo Arena in Detroit has also hosted the basketball classic.

Operation Friendship facts:
The Public School League has won 41 of the 56 Operation Friendship Championship Games played through 2016.
Since 2005, the CHSL has won six Operation Friendship championships, while the PSL has won five.
Detroit Southwestern has won the most Operation Friendship championship games with nine, followed by Detroit Northwestern with five and Detroit Eastern/Detroit King with five. Orchard Lake St. Mary's Prep has won three Operation Friendship championship games, the most among CHSL schools.

Goodfellow Game

The Goodfellow Game was an annual high school football game for the unofficial city of Detroit high school football championship.  The game was played between the champions of the Detroit City League (later the Detroit Public School League) and the Detroit Parochial League (later the Catholic High School League).  The Goodfellow Game was played every year from 1938 through 1967.  The Goodfellow Game was always played at Briggs/Tiger Stadium.

The Goodfellow Game was played in a time before Michigan had a high school state championship playoff.  As a result, the Goodfellow Game was considered one of the state's most prestigious high school football games of its time.

Goodfellow Game facts:

 The Detroit Parochial League won sixteen Goodfellow Games, the Detroit City League won eleven and there were three ties in the 30 Goodfellow Games played.
The Detroit Denby Tars played in the most Goodfellow Games of any school with nine.  The Detroit St. Mary of Redford Rustics played in seven Goodfellow Games, the most among Detroit Parochial League schools.
The Grosse Pointe St. Ambrose Cavaliers and the Detroit Catholic Central Shamrocks won the most Goodfellow Games with five each.  The Detroit Denby Tars won four Goodfellow Games, the most among Detroit City League schools. 
The Grosse Pointe St. Ambrose Cavaliers had the most Goodfellow Game shutouts with three, while the Detroit Denby Tars had the most tied Goodfellow Games with two.
The University of Detroit High Cubs played in three Goodfellows Games, all representing the Detroit City League, before joining the Detroit Parochial League in 1958.
The Goodfellow Game regularly drew crowds of 40,000 spectators at its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
