Wetherby Racecourse is a racecourse situated near the market town of Wetherby in West Yorkshire, England, located  from Leeds city centre. For most of its history the course has hosted only National Hunt racing but staged its first Flat racing fixture in April 2015.

Location
The Racecourse is located on the B1224 York Road, directly adjacent to the A1(M). It is situated opposite Wetherby (HM Prison). There are new access roads between North and East Wetherby and the A1(M). The racecourse can also be accessed from Walton Road at the rear of the stands.

History
Horse racing in Wetherby was first took place on Scaur Bank (now officially known as King George V playing fields, although still most commonly referred to as 'Scaur Bank' or 'The Ings'). In 1891 racing moved to a new site situated off York Road. From the 1920s to the 1950s the racecourse was served by Wetherby Racecourse railway station. In the 1930s the first terraces were erected. A new two-tier stand was erected adjacent to this in the 1970s, and then in 1999 the new Millennium Stand was opened, providing the racecourse with executive banqueting and conference facilities. Up until 1963, Racecourse Specials ran to Wetherby railway station from Bradford Interchange on race days. As the station on York Road had closed many years before, for decades the only rail access was via the station on Linton Road at the other end of Wetherby from the racecourse.

Today

Wetherby Racecourse was the last racecourse in Yorkshire that hosted only National Hunt jump meetings, but it now stages Flat racing as well. The course announced early in 2014 that they were investigating staging summer Flat racing and were granted four fixtures when the 2015 list was released in October 2014. The first Flat racing fixture took place on 26 April 2015.
