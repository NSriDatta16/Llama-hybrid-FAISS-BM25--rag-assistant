SS-Green Light Racing is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, fielding the No. 07 Chevrolet Camaro SS and the No. 08 Chevrolet Camaro/Ford Mustang GT full-time. The team has a technical alliance with Richard Childress Racing for their Camaros while their Mustangs were from a previous alliance with Stewart-Haas Racing.
  
The team is owned by former driver Bobby Dotter, who also drove for the team in numerous races when he was still driving. Dotter is currently the team's sole owner, although at various points in the team's history, businessman Ken Smith (who left the team in July 2017) and Steve Urvan (in 2010 only) as well as Texas politician Gene Christensen (who unsuccessfully ran in the Republican primary for Texas's 4th congressional district in 2008) were co-owners of the team with Dotter.

Green Light began competing in the Truck Series in 2000 and merged with SS Racing in 2008 during the economic downturn after teams merging was a common thing at the time which resulted in financial success and stability. SS Racing was a team that was competing in the ASA and had previously partnered with Green Light's Truck team on various occasions, but fully merged with GLR beginning that year. The team competed in the Truck Series each year until 2017 when they decided to focus on their Xfinity program.

He picked up 9 top-20 finishes, with a best finish of 14th in Bristol (August). He finished 19th in the driver standings. Black returned to the No. 07 for 2017 but was replaced with Todd Bodine for Charlotte. It was later announced that Spencer Boyd and Andy Lally would drive at Pocono and Mid-Ohio respectively.

In 2019, Black Jr. returned to the team from a part-time ride with B. J. McLeod Motorsports to replace Boyd and would compete full-time again in the No. 07. He was announced to return to the team for the 2020 season as well.

On May 23, 2020, Black Jr. announced that he would no longer be driving the No. 07 in order to concentrate on helping his family business, the CDA Technical Institute, recover after it experienced financial problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After Black's departure, it was announced that Rick Ware Racing had cut a deal with SS-Green Light to field some of their drivers in the No. 07 for the remainder of the season. This began with Garrett Smithley in the car for Charlotte and Carson Ware, Rick's son, making his series debut at Bristol.
The team's highlight of the year was when Gray Gaulding wheeled the 07 car to a 2nd-place finish at Daytona International Speedway when the top 4 wrecked on the final corner. Garrett Smithley scored a top 10 at Talladega, and Jade Buford scored a top-10 at Charlotte.

In 2021, Joe Graf Jr. ran most the races in the #07 with Ross Chastain, J. J. Yeley and Josh Bilicki making appearances in the No. 07 throughout the season. Graf scored a top-ten finish in the Sparks 300.

SS Green-Light Racing switched from running Chevrolets to Fords in 2022. Graf will be the primary driver in the No. 07 once again.

On February 26, 2022, Cup Series driver Cole Custer claimed the team's first victory, which came at Auto Club Speedway. The entry was a collaborative effort between the team and Stewart-Haas Racing. On October 4, Truck Series driver Hailie Deegan announced she would make her Xfinity Series debut in the No. 07 at Las Vegas.

For 2023 SS Green-Light Racing switched back to Chevrolet from Ford and revealed Blaine Perkins would drive the No. 07 full-time.
