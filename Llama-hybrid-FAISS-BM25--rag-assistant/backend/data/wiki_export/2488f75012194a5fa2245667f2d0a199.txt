The Hispano club competed in the Southern New York State Football Association with several successful runs in their Cup competition during the 1920s. The club won the competition in 1927 and 1930 as the New York Hispano. N.Y. Hispano was a member of the professional Eastern Soccer League - a rival of the A.S.L. during the "soccer war" of 1929-1930.

After 7 games of the 1933/34 ASL season the team merged with Brooklyn F.C. The aggregation was renamed Brooklyn Hispano Football Club which began play on January 21, 1934 and assumed the record of Hispano F.C. in the standings.
