History
During his lifetime, when Lord Swaminarayan went around village to village, on request from his followers he gave his belongings as 'prasadi' to his followers. This 'prasadi' is passed from generation to generation, and is still owned by hundreds of families. Swaminarayan temples also have their own collections, but items are usually not kept in an organized manner. The people who pass through them have no historical information about these items. Acharya Tejendraprasadji Maharaj has endeavored to establish this museum of Swaminarayan's belongings. He had some personal collections of Swaminarayan, and dreamed of gathering the 'prasadi' from the devotees. He intended to put all this collection, which gave a glimpse of Swaminarayan's life, in the museum. To fulfill this dream he passed on leadership of the Narnarayan Dev Gadi to his son, Koshalendraprasad in order to give full attention to this project. He agreed to celebrate his 60th birthday only on one condition, that all the donation and proceedings given by the devotees will be passed on towards the realization of this museum. This was the founding stone of the museum.

The museum was opened on 8 March 2011 by the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi. The ceremony started on 5 March 2011 and continued till 9 March 2011 in which 800,000 people participated. An organ donation camp was held on the museum premises on 8 March 2011 to coincide with the opening ceremony by Shatayu (a NGO). A total of 1600 - 900 women and 700 men - took the pledge for multi-organ donation.

Collection

What makes this place unique is that it houses the only existing writing scripts with the signature of Swaminarayan. This document is a power of attorney given by Swaminarayan to Thakur Kubersingh to enable the latter to handle a land dispute at the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Ahmedabad. This document is the centerpiece of the museum.

Sustainable construction

Solar and wind energy power this air-conditioned museum which has been planned with a green cover of three hundred trees surrounding the building. Rainwater harvesting is done using an underground reservoir. Windows are double glazed and insulated, along with two outer walls and an insulated ceiling to help maintain the internal temperature and save electricity. Instead of bricks, fly ash blocks have been used for the structure.
