Military service
Chapman served in the Royal Fusiliers in 1914–20, particularly in France and Belgium in 1915–18 during the First World War. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1919 New Year Honours and awarded the Military Cross (MC) in December 1919:
"For conspicuous gallantry and leadership near Ghissignies, on 4th November, 1918. When the battalion was going through Gihissignies in support of the attack, information was received that the left company of the leading battalion had been held up. Under heavy shell fire he went forward to reconnoitre, and found that the supporting battalion appeared likely to become prematurely involved in the fighting. By his energy and initiative in taking command of the situation this was prevented."

From 1920 to 1940, Chapman was involved in book publishing and then served in the Second World War.
