Manyame Air Base (IATA: HRE, ICAO: FVHA) is one of the two main air bases for the Air Force of Zimbabwe. Formerly known as New Sarum Air Force Station, Manyame Air Base is situated in Harare and is the principal air force establishment and provides facilities for aircraft squadrons of differing roles, training schools for technicians, staff and academic training and security dog handlers. A full range of amenities, which include workshops, transport fleets, equipment depots, accommodation, sports and entertainment facilities, support the base. Located on the same grounds as the Harare International Airport and sharing the same runway, it is home to these squadrons. It also houses the technical training school and the dog training unit.
