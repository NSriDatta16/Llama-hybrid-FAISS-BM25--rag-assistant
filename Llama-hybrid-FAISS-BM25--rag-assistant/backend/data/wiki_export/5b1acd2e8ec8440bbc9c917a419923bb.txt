Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983–1991 is the first compilation album by American hip hop group Run-D.M.C. It was released in 1991 and was complemented by a greatest hits video collection (released separately). Some pressings included an uncensored version of "Beats To The Rhyme" as heard in the film "Tougher Than Leather".

In 1998, due to the success of the Jason Nevins remixes of "It's Like That" and "It's Tricky," the compilation was re-released as Together Forever: Greatest Hits 1983–1998, with the two remixes added to the compilation.
