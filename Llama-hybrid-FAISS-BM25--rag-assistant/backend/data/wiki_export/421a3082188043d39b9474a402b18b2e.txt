Works in Progress is a compilation album by Tim Buckley. The album is a collection of studio recordings dating from early and mid-1968 in addition to one recording dating from a recording session in 1967. The material on this album consists of songs Buckley was working on for a third album, the at the time unnamed album that would become Happy Sad. The majority of the songs from the studio recording sessions were lost or erased but some songs were preserved on a compilation reel at the studio. The large part of these recordings were not used on Happy Sad and appear only on this compilation. Some of the songs here evolved into another song: "Danang" and "Ashbury Park" later came to form two movements of the three-part song "Love From Room 108 At The Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)" that would appear on the final version of Buckley's third album.

The compilation also comes with a 20-page booklet complete with lyrics and liner notes by Buckley's lead guitarist, Lee Underwood. The original 1999 CD release consisted of a sole batch of 7,500 copies. A larger commercial release was made in 2001.
