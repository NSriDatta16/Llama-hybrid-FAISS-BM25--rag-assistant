Mary Bridget Ryan (; 31 January 1898 – 8 February 1981) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. She was a member of Cumann na mBan and a founder member of Fianna Fáil.

She was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary constituency at the 1944 general election. Her husband Martin Ryan was a TD for the same constituency from 1933 until his death in 1943. After boundary changes, she was returned at the 1948 general election for Tipperary North, and re-elected at the 1951, 1954 and 1957 general elections.

At the 1961 general election, she lost her seat to Fine Gael's Thomas Dunne.
