History
On August 22, 1952, XESS received its concession.  After a period of construction and testing, XESS signed on the air on May 4, 1954. The station broadcast to Ensenada on 1450 kHz and was owned by Fernando J. Rodríguez Sullivan. Radiodifusora de Ensenada, S.A. became the concessionaire on March 9, 1966, and in 1986, it raised its power from 250 to 1,000 watts.

In 2003, the station was moved to Puerto Nuevo along with XESDD.  The next year, it moved frequencies to 620 kHz to reduce interference to stations in the United States and to improve its signal in both Tijuana and San Diego.  Media Sports de México became the concessionaire in 2005.

In 2007, XESS became a network affiliate of ESPN Deportes Radio. That network ceased operations in 2019, with XESS then affiliating with Unanimo Deportes. However, by that time, XESS was also airing talk programming for the Tecate area, first as "Radio Frontera 620" and then as "PSN Radio Tecate" beginning in 2018.
