History

Originally organized by the People's Republic of China as the Jinsui Border Region, the region was sparsely populated in the early 20th century. However, the discovery of coal, iron, and aluminum deposits incentivized economic investment and population growth in the region. In May 1971, Lüliang was established as a Prefecture-level area, and in July 2004 the area Lüliang was reformed into a Prefecture-level city. 

In 2010, the city had a GDP growth rate of 21%; at the time, prices for coal were high and the city had an active coal industry. There were plans to build a new business district in Lüliang, strongly supported by then-mayor Zhang Zhongsheng. However, in 2014, the GDP declined by 2%, and by 2015, due to a slowing economy, plans in Lüliang stalled and many apartment blocks were left unoccupied. Zhongsheng lost his job due to corruption in 2015, and was sentenced to death in 2021 on bribery charges, with a 2-year reprieve.

In July 2021, following a Chinese government crackdown on Abrahamic religions in China, Christian church minister Zhao Weikai was arrested and charged with "illegal holding of materials promoting terrorism and extremism" by the municipal police and was forbidden from meeting with his legal council. This incident was used by various human rights groups as an example of religious persecution by the Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese-American reproductive biologist Min Chueh Chang was born in Lüliang in 1908.
