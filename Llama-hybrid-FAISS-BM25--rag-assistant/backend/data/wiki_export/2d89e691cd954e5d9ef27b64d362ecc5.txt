ageHa (also as 'AGH') was a weekend club event in Tokyo, Japan. It was held on Friday and Saturday at the Usen Studio Coast event space in the Shin-Kiba district, which also hosted live concerts and other events. The word Ageha is Japanese for 'Swallowtail butterfly'. The event's name has also been presented in the 3-letter-version 'AGH' in capital letters, for instance on the official staff shirts. If the three letters are pronounced separately in German, they are pronounced as "ah-geh-ha", similar to the Japanese pronunciation of the club's name.

Description
The Studio Coast event space had a large main dance floor, a chill out space, an open terrace with a pool, and an outdoor dance tent. It was located on the waterfront in eastern Tokyo's reclaimed industrial district and had a capacity of over a thousand people.
