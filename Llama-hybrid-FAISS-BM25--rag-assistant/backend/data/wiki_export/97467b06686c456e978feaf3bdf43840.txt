Timothy Weston the extroverted performer, is jokingly called a prisoners little sister to whom he resembles. In this episode we learn of John's passion for engineering, physics and Dragonball Z. After their loss, the Nerds FC share lunch with the prisoners who on camera appear a jovial group of young men who have pushed societies boundaries.

Episode 5 - From Mice to Men
Keen to change the Nerds from , Coach Andy Harper sends the boys on another trip to confront their fears and extend their comfort zones. In the Kangaroo Valley the Nerds (with difficulty) set up camp in tents and hike off into the bush. There they in turn climb a hugh tree, to a platform to take a 'leap of faith' and try and catch a suspended bar. Robin Chow, a professed gamer obsessive is clearly out of this comfort zone, amongst the bush and wildlife. The next challenge after dinner is for the Nerds to trek around the bush along a rope blindfolded.

The next morning the Nerds abseil down a 60m cliff to climax their stay before being handed back to Andy Harper at the end of the episode.

The Nerds FC is taken to Aussie Stadium 24 hours before the game. Coach Harper pointedly asks Trent whether he is able to play as Goalkeeper. Trent promises to put his body on the line, and protect the goals: "It's my temple - I can't let anything in there," he says.
