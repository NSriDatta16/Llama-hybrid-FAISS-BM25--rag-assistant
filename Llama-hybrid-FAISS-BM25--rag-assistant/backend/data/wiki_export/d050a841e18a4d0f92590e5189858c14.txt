Starkers in Tokyo is a live acoustic album by English rock band Whitesnake, released only in Japan on 9 September 1997. It is performed in the style of the Unplugged series and simply features David Coverdale on vocals and Adrian Vandenberg on acoustic guitar.  The performance was recorded at the EMI studios in Japan for a small audience of fans in support of the most recent album "Restless Heart". This recording was also released on VHS and Laserdisc in Japan only. This CD was released outside Japan almost a year later in June 1998.

The album includes an acoustic version of Whitesnake's biggest hit "Here I Go Again".

The album subsequently appeared on the second disc of Whitesnake's 2018 acoustic complication album, Unzipped.
