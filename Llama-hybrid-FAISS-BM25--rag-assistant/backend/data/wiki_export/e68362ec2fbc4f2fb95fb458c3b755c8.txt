The Yijiangshan Islands are two small islands  from the Dachen Islands, located off the coast of Taizhou, Zhejiang, in the East China Sea.

During the First Taiwan Strait crisis the islands were captured in January 1955 by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) from Republic of China (ROC) Nationalist forces in the Battle of Yijiangshan even as the U.S. Seventh Fleet was patrolling nearby.
