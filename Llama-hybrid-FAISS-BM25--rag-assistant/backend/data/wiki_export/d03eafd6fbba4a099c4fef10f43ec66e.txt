Personal life
On August 13, 2013, Young was en route to a tour date in Montana when he went into septic shock from a small cut on his leg which became infected. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital in  Denver. The medical team immediately started Young on medication, and he had surgery on August 14 to treat the infection. Young returned home under his physician's care. As expected, his mobility was impacted by the surgery and his doctor requested he wait a full week post-surgery to resume touring. Young resumed on August 22.

In June 2014, Young cancelled a performance at the CMA Music Festival after accidentally cutting his left hand with a kitchen knife. The cut required surgery to reconnect tendons in the hand.

Television

 While playing Air Cannon Cornhole, a bet was made and accepted by Young’s Viral VIP with Shelton that if he gets it in the center whole he gets 6 points so they can catch up to Team Elle. The counter offer was should they lose, Shelton would pick what they had to do from the Wheel of Redemption. Even though the viral VIP did make the shot to tie the game they lost in sudden death. On the third round Team Elle had Carson Daley shoot for them where he scored 3 points.
