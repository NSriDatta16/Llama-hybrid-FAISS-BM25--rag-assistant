Renato Salvatori (20 March 1933 – 27 March 1988) was an Italian actor.

Born in Seravezza, Province of Lucca, Salvatori began his career in his teens playing juvenile, romantic roles. After working with directors such as Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica, he developed into one of Italy's strongest character actors.

He met French actress Annie Girardot on the set of the film Rocco and His Brothers (1960) and married her on 6 January 1962. They had a daughter, Giulia; later the couple separated but never divorced.

Salvatori died in Rome of liver cirrhosis on 27 March 1988.
