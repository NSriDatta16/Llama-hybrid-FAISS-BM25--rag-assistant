Proja (Cyrillic: Проја, ) is a Balkan dish made of corn flour, baking powder, sunflower oil, sparkling water and salt. Proha, Prova or Razljevak are alternative names used in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It has been popular in times of widespread poverty, mostly before the 1950s, and remains a common everyday meal. It is often mistaken with projara, a somewhat fancier variant of proja, which includes the additional ingredients flour, eggs and yogurt.

The ingredients should be mixed together and baked in a greased pan (which should be 5 cm high) until golden. Best served with kajmak and sour cream.
