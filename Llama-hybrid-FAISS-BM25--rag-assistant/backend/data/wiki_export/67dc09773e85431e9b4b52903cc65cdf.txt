The Glass House Effect (or GHE) is the resulting phenomenon brought on by an awareness that one is subject to ubiquitous surveillance. In corporate environments, the transparency is considered a good idea, as it is believed this discourages corporate crime and other misfeasance.

The Glass House Effect can cause a sense of pessimism in persons who are subjected to such unrestrained monitoring. In such circumstances, solitude is conspicuously absent, and privacy is considered a thoughtcrime. The messages conveyed to the subject in such an environment usually involve some variation on the notion of Catch-22, such as:

 There is no place to hide; nor should you want to.
 Any exhibited avoidance behavior is considered a threat, and an invitation for additional scrutiny.
