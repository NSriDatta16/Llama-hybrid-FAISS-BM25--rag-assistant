History
WBYR was the former WERT-FM and WKSD in Van Wert, Ohio, owned by Ray Livesay. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, WERT-FM simulcast its sister AM station.  When the FCC gave the ultimatum for Class B FM stations to increase power to maximum levels or be downgraded, WERT-FM increased power to 50,000 watts and introduced a beautiful music format.  Once the station was sold to Atlantic Resources, the call letters were changed to WKSD ("Kiss 99") with a satellite-delivered adult contemporary format.

In January 1989, the station began stunting with comedy clips (including Looney Tunes clips), construction sound effects and a vague but brief announcement repeatedly for about a week, "9890 songs in a row on Fort Wayne's new 98.9". A classic hits format debuted on the 11th of the month at Noon, with the first song being "Old Time Rock and Roll" by Bob Seger. Meanwhile, the WKSD calls resurfaced at 99.7 FM licensed to Paulding, Ohio; WKSD 99.7 FM now features oldies and sports talk as a sister station to WERT/1220.
