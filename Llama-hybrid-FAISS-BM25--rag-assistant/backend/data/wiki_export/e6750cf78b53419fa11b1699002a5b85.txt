Diego Borrego (born 29 January 1972) is a Spanish golfer.

He started playing golf at the age of seven and turned professional in 1991. He was a rookie on the European Tour in 1994, and two years later, he had his best season, winning the Turespana Masters and finishing thirtieth on the European Tour Order of Merit. He won his second European Tour title at the 2002 Madeira Island Open, but he has sometimes struggled to hold on to his card, and in 2006 dropped down to the second tier Challenge Tour.
