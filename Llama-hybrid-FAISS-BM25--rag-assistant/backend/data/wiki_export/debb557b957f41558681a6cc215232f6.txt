History
Diamond Bar High School was founded in 1982 and was the growing city's first high school.  Diamond Bar High School is part of the Walnut Valley Unified School District, which was established in 1970. Diamond Bar High's first students were residents that lived in south Diamond Bar (specifically residents that lived south of Diamond Bar's Grand Avenue). It is a dividing line that still exists today. Prior to the opening of DBHS, the area's students were bused from Diamond Bar to Walnut High School. Some of the teachers came from Suzanne Middle School, Chaparral Middle School and Walnut High School. The first principal of the school was Walt Holmes, who came to DBHS from North Monterey County High School in Castroville, California, where he also served as principal.

Academic programs
Diamond Bar High School has a relatively rigorous and competitive atmosphere for a public high school. It is ranked 219 on the US News's Best High Schools in the nation and ranked 39 on the best California high schools.

Pathways Communications Academy
Pathways is an alternate program offered to students. The program offers different courses and class schedules. The curriculum includes a broad range of college preparatory courses and work experience classes.

Brahma Tech Academy
Brahma Tech is a curriculum-driven academic diploma program with an emphasis on the relevance and application of STEM - science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in today's workplace. The goal of Brahma Tech is to address the need for a stronger and more specific STEM education by equipping students with a competent set of skills in these critical fields.

The Brahma Tech curriculum, spanning four years of high school, consists of an entry-level course called Computer Systems, followed by designated courses in one of four subsidiaries (or "strands") of the student's choice concluding with a 150-hour internship.

The four strands available are:

Information Information and Communication Technology: How technology is utilized in the realms of journalism, global society, and enterprise.

Digital Media and Design: How to utilize graphic design technology to create and publish works ranging from illustration, photography, to the yearbook.

Engineering and Architecture: An introduction to engineering from architectural design, robotics, to computer repair. Advanced courses focus solely on engineering design.

Computer Science: An introduction to computer science principles in both programming and hardware repairs. Students will be able to take an AP class.

The 150-hour Internship not only includes an online internship course but also Seminars and a Senior Presentation about a topic of their choice.

Students who successfully complete the program will receive a STEM diploma and have the honor of wearing the academy stole at graduation. The Brahma Tech program also offers a competitive internship at The Boeing Company, to which a minimum of five students are offered positions. While scholarships are available, if a student were to take this internship opportunity, he or she is thus bound to the program and is forced to complete the program, no matter the cost.

Music program
In March 2013, the Diamond Bar High Symphony Orchestra competed at the prestigious National Orchestra Cup held at the Lincoln Center in New York with Tchaikovsky's masterpiece "Swan Lake." In addition to finishing second overall, the orchestra also brought home the Best String Section and Best High String Soloist Awards; the latter was won by concertmaster Johnny Wang.
In April 2013, the Diamond Bar concert percussion ensemble were the Southern California Percussion Alliance PSCO champions (placing first) in San Bernardino, CA, and placed second at the Winter Guard International world championships in Dayton, Ohio. They performed the show, "Star-Crossed Lovers," an arrangement of music surrounding the story of Romeo & Juliet. It was arranged by instructor Gabriel Cobas. In addition, in the same year, the Diamond Bar indoor drumline placed third at the Southern California Percussion Alliance PSA finals, with a show named "Bushido."

Diamond Bar High School has been recognized as the 2014 National Grammy Signature School, thanks to the choral and instrumental music programs at DBHS.
