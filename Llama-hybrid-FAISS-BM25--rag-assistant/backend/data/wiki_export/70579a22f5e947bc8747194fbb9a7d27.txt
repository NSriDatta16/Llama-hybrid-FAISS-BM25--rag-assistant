Plockton High School is a 221-pupil high school in the village of Plockton, Scotland.  The catchment area for the school stretches from Applecross in the north to Corran in the south. Since the opening of the Skye Bridge, increasing numbers of pupils from South Skye, who would have traditionally gone to Portree High School, have instead attended Plockton High School.  The school has a small hostel to cater for pupils who live far away.
