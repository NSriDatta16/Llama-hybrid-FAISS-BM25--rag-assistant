Four secular Catholic priests presided over it, as well as the Brothers of Christian Instruction, who also supervised several other religious and educational institutions throughout the Republic of Haiti. The school also has a long history with the island's religious and political figures, archbishops and presidents. Former President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide was educated at the school.
