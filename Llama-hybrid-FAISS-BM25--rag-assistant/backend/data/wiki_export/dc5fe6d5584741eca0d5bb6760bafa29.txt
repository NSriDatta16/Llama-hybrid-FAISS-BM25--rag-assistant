Lansdowne Road railway station () is a railway station in Dublin, Ireland. The station serves the Ballsbridge and Upper Baggot Street areas of Dublin 4.

Facilities and services 
The station has two through platforms, 1 and 2, connected via a subway. Both have separate entrances as there is a level crossing adjacent to the station on Lansdowne Road. There are 2 automated ticket vending machines at both entrances. When there is an event at the stadium, additional access points are opened to allow for crowd control.

All DART services serve the station, as do several South Eastern Commuter (Dublin Connolly to Gorey) and a number of services to Drogheda and Maynooth.

History
The station was adjacent to its namesake Lansdowne Road Stadium before the stadium was demolished in 2007 and replaced on-site by the new Aviva Stadium, which the station now serves. It has disability access to both platforms. The information office is open at various times between 06:00-00:00 Monday to Friday and during events at the Aviva Stadium.

The station opened on 1 July 1870. It was electrified in 1983 with the arrival of DART services.
