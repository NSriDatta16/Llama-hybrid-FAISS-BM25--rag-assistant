Military career
Arthur Hayne began his military career in 1807. When the frigate Chesapeake was attacked, he secured a commission as first lieutenant in a regiment of light dragoons, commanded by Colonel Wade Hampton of Revolutionary war fame. In 1809, he was sent by Hampton to Mississippi, where he laid the Foundation for his later career. He fought in the battle of Sacket's Harbor, was brevetted major for gallantry in action, accompanied General Wilkinson down the St. Lawrence in the contemplated attack on Montreal and also served with General Brown. In 1814 he became Inspector General, with orders to join General Andrew Jackson in the Creek nation. In the absence of Colonel Butler, he also acted as adjutant general. Jackson sent him to Fort Montgomery to organize forces for an attack upon Pensacola. In the storming of the city, Colonel Hayne was one of the first to take possession of an enemy battery under heavy fire. After its fall, he was placed in charge of the city. In the famous Battle of New Orleans, Hayne selected the site for Jackson's defense and had much to do with repulsing the British and saving the city, as did Major Wade Hampton of Columbia. After the battle, Jackson sent Hayne to Washington to secure additional troops for the continued defense of the city, not realizing the war had ended. During the war, he was thrice brevetted for bravery.
