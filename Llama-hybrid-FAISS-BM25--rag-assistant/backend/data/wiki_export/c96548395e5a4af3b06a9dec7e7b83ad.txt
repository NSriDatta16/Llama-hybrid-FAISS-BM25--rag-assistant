History
The Cougars spent time in the Eastern Junior "B" league and the Central Junior C Hockey League before jumping to the Central Junior "B" league in 1992.  The team graduated to Junior "A" when the league became the OPJHL the next season.

In the summer of 2010, the Cobourg Cougars absorbed the Bowmanville Eagles.  This move eliminated their local competition for players and local fan base.  In March 2011, the Cougars also absorbed the Streetsville Derbys. The Cougars were chosen to host the 2017 Royal Bank Cup.
