The station was formerly known as Fučíkova, after journalist Julius Fučík. The station was opened on 3 November 1984 as the northern terminus of the extension from Sokolovská (later renamed Florenc), a status it retained until 26 June 2004 when the line was extended to Ládví station.

The station is  below ground level, and contains two tracks on opposite sides of the station platform. The station has two exits - the southern exit on Plynární street leads to tram stops and a local bus station, and the northern exit on Vrbenského street leads to the mainline and suburban railway station and a long-distance bus station.
