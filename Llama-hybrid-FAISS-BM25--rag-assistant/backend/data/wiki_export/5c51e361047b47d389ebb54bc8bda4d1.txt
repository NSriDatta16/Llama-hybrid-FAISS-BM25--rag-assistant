Cuevas was released by Club América, and trained for brief period with Premier League club Portsmouth.

However, Cuevas would end up playing the first half of 2008 for Libertad in his native country and was later signed by Brazilian club Santos in July 2008. On 15 January 2009, he was released from his contract with Santos.
