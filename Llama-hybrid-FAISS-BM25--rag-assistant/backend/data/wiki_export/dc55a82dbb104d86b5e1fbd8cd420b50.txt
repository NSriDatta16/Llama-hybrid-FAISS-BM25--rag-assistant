Live at the Garden is the fourth DVD release by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam, recorded on July 8, 2003 at Madison Square Garden in New York City. It was released on November 11, 2003.

Overview
The DVD documents Pearl Jam on its 2003 Riot Act Tour, the band's first with organist Boom Gaspar. The concert was also made available as the 7/8/03 - New York, New York official bootleg. It includes several bonus songs, including four montages, as well as the Matt Cam feature (which debuted on one of the band's previous DVD releases, Touring Band 2000) with which you can watch selected songs from the camera focused on drummer Matt Cameron. Live at the Garden has been certified three times platinum by the RIAA.

The DVD features an improv by lead guitarist Mike McCready within "Even Flow" that goes on for nearly five minutes. "Wishlist" contains a tag of the Buzzcocks song "Why Can't I Touch It?"

Vocalist Eddie Vedder, in tribute to the late Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood, says, "I think Jeff and Stone will back me up on this: Andy would have loved it here."
