Biography 
Pedro Manuel Guerra Mancito was born in Güímar, Tenerife, on June 2, 1966. Guerra is the son of Pedro Guerra Cabrera, the first President of the Canarian Parliament. 
He began studying the guitar at the Conservatorio Superior de Música de Tenerife.

At the age of 16 he started to perform regularly throughout Tenerife. At 18, he moved to the university city San Cristóbal de La Laguna, where he met fellow singer-songwriters Andrés Molina, Rogelio Botanz, and Marisa Delgado, with whom he formed Taller Canario de Canción in 1985. Marisa left the group the following year.

Pedro Guerras' style is based on Canarian folk music, as well as contemporary popular music, Latin American, and North African music.
