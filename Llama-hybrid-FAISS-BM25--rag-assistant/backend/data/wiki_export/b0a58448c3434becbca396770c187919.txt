Joseph Pisani (born November 17, 1976) is an American contemporary artist, abstract painter, and photographer, living in Zurich, Switzerland.

Life
Joseph Pisani was born and raised in the Bronx, New York, by a second-generation Italian family with strong ethnic roots. He was originally taught to draw and paint by his grandmother at around the age of seven.

He left New York in 1994 and traveled throughout America, including visits to forty-two of the fifty states, before setting off on a "backpack" solo tour of Western Europe. He stayed in Prague for a time, and in 1996 settled in the Rocky Mountains, West of Denver, Colorado. As well as painting and drawing, he began to design and produce furniture and experiment with wood sculpture and mixed media.

In 1998 he traveled again to Europe and the Middle East and found "an interesting spot hidden between two worlds" in South Sinai, Egypt, where he discovered scuba diving. The influence of the colorful underwater life of the Red Sea is apparent in paintings, such as "The Secrets of the Underwater World", and "Deep (Approximately 63 Meters Below the Red Sea)".

Pisani continues to travel extensively, visiting seventy-one countries to date  and using his travel, along with philosophy, as the main source of inspiration for his art.

Art
Pisani's is influenced by the Abstract Expressionism of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. However, unlike Rothko, who purposely avoided giving titles to his work, because he did not want to influence viewers, Pisani deliberately lends clues through the poetic titles of his paintings:
