Streaming XML is a synonym for dynamic data in XML format.

Another popular use of this term refers to one method of consuming XML data â€“ largely known as Simple API for XML. This is via asynchronous events that are generated as the XML data is parsed. In this context, the consumer streams through the XML data one item at a time. It does not have anything to do whether the underlying data is being updated via dynamic or static means.
