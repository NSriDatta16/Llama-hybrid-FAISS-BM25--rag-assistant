2020s
In February 2017 the district proposed redrawing the attendance boundaries of its high schools; this would take effect in the 2020-2021 school year. The district also plans to establish one ninth grade center for each comprehensive high school. According to the proposed 2020-2021 high school map, the eastern portion of the Spring census-designated place will be reassigned from Spring High School to Dekaney High School. The school district delayed the rezoning at least until after the 2021-2022 school year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, as it determines how the pandemic changed student enrollment patterns in Spring ISD.

Campus 
It is located along Interstate 45, about  north of Downtown Houston. In the 1990s banners about the school's achievements were posted so commuters on I-45 could view them.
