The station is situated in the northern part of Ã˜restad. The name of the station is related to Danmarks Radio's new headquarters DR Byen (DR town) that lies close to the station. Originally, the station was named Universitetet Station, because of new university buildings were intended to be constructed near the station, but the project was moved nearer Islands Brygge Station, next to the old buildings.
