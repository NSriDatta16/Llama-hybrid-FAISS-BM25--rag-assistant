Waddle is currently a co-host of "Waddle and Silvy" on ESPN 1000, and a football analyst for WLS-TV in Chicago.  He also appears on Pro Football Weekly and NFL Network. He spent his entire six-year career with the Chicago Bears. He attended Boston College.

College career
Waddle was a receiver for the Boston College Eagles. He is sixth all-time in career receptions with 139, and amassed 1,956 yards and six touchdowns.  Waddle finished his collegiate career first on the school’s all-time list for receptions in a season with 70 in 1988, and is tied for first in all-time receptions in a single game with 13 against TCU in 1988. Waddle was a first-team All-East selection in 1988 and made appearance in the Japan Bowl.  His achievements at BC resulted in his induction into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998. He also played alongside Doug Flutie's younger brother, Darren Flutie.

1985: 8 catches for 122 yards.
1986: 18 catches for 160 yards and 1 touchdown.
1987: 43 catches for 781 yards.
1988: 70 catches for 902 yards and 5 touchdowns.

Professional career
In 1989, the Chicago Bears signed Waddle as an undrafted free agent. During his first two years with the Bears, he struggled to make an impact as a receiver. Waddle lacked the size and speed to distinguish himself from other Bears wide receivers and remained on the lower rungs of the team's depth chart. He received a chance to start in 1991 after the Bears lost starters due to injuries. In a nationally televised Monday night game against the Jets, he made eight catches for 102 yards in an overtime win. In Chicago's wild card playoff loss to Dallas (17-13), Waddle was the Bears' sole standout performer on the offensive side of the ball, catching nine passes for 104 yards and a touchdown. His performance established him as a mainstay in the Bears lineup and clinched him a spot on the famed All-Madden team.

In 1992, Waddle began the season as a starting wide receiver and became a fan favorite. In the opener against the Detroit Lions, he caught a last second game-winning touchdown pass from Jim Harbaugh. Later in a week 4 victory over the Falcons, he managed to outrun Deion Sanders into the endzone for a score. Waddle missed the final four games of the season because of injury.

After finishing the 1992 season with a record of 5–11, coach Mike Ditka was fired and Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt was brought in to replace him. After leading the Bears in receiving yards and receptions in 1993, Wannstedt demoted Waddle in favor of faster receivers. Later that year, he suffered a concussion and a partially torn knee ligament from an illegal hit by Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive back Thomas Everett.  The following off-season, the Bears offered Waddle a choice between a guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary, and a more lucrative deal that would be dissolved if he were cut.  He instead attended the Cincinnati Bengals' training camp, but elected to retire, as he felt that his lingering leg injuries no longer allowed him to compete at the professional level.
