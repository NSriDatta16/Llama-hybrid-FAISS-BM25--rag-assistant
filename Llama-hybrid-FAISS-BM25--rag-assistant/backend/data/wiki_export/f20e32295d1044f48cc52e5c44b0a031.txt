Cedarbrook is a neighborhood located in the Northwest section of the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

The Ivy Hill neighborhood comprises roughly the northwestern half of Cedarbrook. Ivy Hill Cemetery (established 1867) forms the geographic heart of the neighborhood. (The neighborhood most likely takes its name from the cemetery [rather than vice versa], as the area was woods and farmland when the cemetery was established.) Ivy Hill Road is sometimes mistakenly restyled as "Ivyhill Road"â€”most notably on its own newest street signs.
