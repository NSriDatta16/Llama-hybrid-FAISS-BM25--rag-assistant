China is the world's second most populous country, and its largest city, Shanghai, is the largest city proper in the world, with a population of 26.3 million as of 2019. According to the Demographia research group, in 2017, there were 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the "urban area", as defined by the group's methodology.

Definition and classification 
According to the administrative divisions of China, there are three levels of cities, namely direct-administered municipalities (), prefecture-level cities (), and county-level cities (). The special administrative regions () of Hong Kong and Macau are not included in this administrative classification.

Municipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a 'city' in the strictest sense of the term, but are, instead, an administrative unit comprising, typically, both the urban core (a city in the strict sense) and surrounding rural or less-urbanized areas.

Prefecture-level cities nearly always contain multiple counties (), county-level cities, and other such sub-divisions. To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (city in the strict sense), the term "" (shì qū; "urban area") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than , sometimes only the urban core, whereas the agglomeration overtakes the city limits. Thus, the "urban core" would be roughly comparable to the American term "city limit", the "shì qū", or "urban area", would be roughly comparable to "metropolitan area", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.

While in 2013 Chongqing had the largest population total of any special municipality, 28 million, only 4.5 million of the people were in the actual Chongqing urban area, with the remainder of the population in suburban and rural areas.
