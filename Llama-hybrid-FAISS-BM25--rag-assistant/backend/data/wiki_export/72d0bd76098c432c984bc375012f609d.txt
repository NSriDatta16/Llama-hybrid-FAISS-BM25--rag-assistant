"Let the Beat Control Your Body" is a song by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance band 2 Unlimited. It was released by various labels in January 1994 as the fifth and final single from the band's second album, No Limits (1993). The album version is largely instrumental and contains just a few spoken words from bandmembers Ray Slijngaard and Anita Doth. The single version contains full verses rapped by Slijngaard and a new chorus sung by Doth, which were co-written by them both. The song enjoyed chart success in many European countries, peaking at number two in the Netherlands and within the top 10 in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. It was nominated in the category for Best Song on MTV Awards. Nigel Simpkiss directed the music video for "Let the Beat Control Your Body".

Reception and airplay
Miranda Sawyer from The Guardian wrote, "The result is a hectic fusion of marching techno beat, catchy tune, and marvellously bossy lyrics: Speed up the pace./ Take it to the maximum./ Let the beat control your body." Simon Price from Melody Maker commented, "Try listening to the intros to "No Limit" and "Let the Beat Control Your Body" without going at it like a woodpecker on poppers." James Hamilton from Music Weeks RM Dance Update described the song as a "techno-pop galloper". Scottish Perthshire Advertiser stated, "You know what to expect and, yes, they deliver it!" Mark Frith from Smash Hits declared it as "buzzy" in his review of the No Limits album, complimenting it as a song "that stands out individually." Another editor, Tony Cross, gave it two out of five, saying, "It's still techno, techno, techno with a dash of techno for good measure."

"Let The Beat Control Your Body" entered the European airplay chart Border Breakers at number 16 on 4 February due to crossover airplay in Central-, North West- and North-Europe and peaked at number four on 19 March.

Music video
The accompanying music video for "Let The Beat Control Your Body" was directed by Nigel Simpkiss and released in the UK in January 1994. It received heavy rotation on MTV Europe and was A-listed on Germany's VIVA. In the video, Anita Doth and Ray Slijngaard performs in front of a wall consisting of vibrating speakers. In between, several gymnasts and dancers are performing, mixed with computer generated images. In the rap part, Slijngaard trains bare-chested with weights. Tom Sheehan from Melody Maker felt the 2 Unlimited look in the video was very provocative: "Head-to-toe PVC suffocation gear. It was very S&M. Stephen Milligan would have loved it." "Let the Beat Control Your Body" was later made available on 2 Unlimited's official YouTube channel in 2013, and as of September 2023, it had generated almost five million views. Simpkiss would also be directing the video for the duo's next single, "The Real Thing".
