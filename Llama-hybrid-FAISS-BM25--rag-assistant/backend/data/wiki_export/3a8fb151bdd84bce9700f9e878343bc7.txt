Ernest H. Wiegand (July 10, 1886 â€“ April 1973) was a professor of horticulture at Oregon State University who, in 1925 during Prohibition, developed a brine method that led to the modern maraschino cherry. He won the Nicholas Appert Award in 1960.  The food sciences building on the university's Corvallis, Oregon campus, Wiegand Hall, is named in his honour.
