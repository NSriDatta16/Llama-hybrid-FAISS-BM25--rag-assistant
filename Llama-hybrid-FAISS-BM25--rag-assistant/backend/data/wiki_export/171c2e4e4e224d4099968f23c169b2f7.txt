Plot

Thangapaandi (S.J. Suryah) is the son of Malaiswamy (Vijayakumar), who is financially mediocre but well respected and loved in the Tirunelveli village. Thangapaandi, however, is immature and spends his time gallivanting about the village and dancing at temple functions, while failing his +2 examinations with regularity every year.

His niece Rasathi (Preethi Varma) is in love with him, as their parents have informally promised them to each other from childhood itself. However, Thangapaandi pursues his own agenda and falls for loud-mouthed orphan girl Ayyakka (Meera Jasmine), who makes and sells pots for a living.

Thangapaandi, despite his lack of a regular job or prospects, appears to be the most sought after bachelor in the village. In the midst of this love 'square', the elders add their own two cents of interference, causing more chaos. How Thangapaandi and his ladies deal with this is the fodder for the rest of the film.

Cast

Production
Rathnakumar, who directed Senathipathi with Sathyaraj, announced in 2005 that S. J. Suryah would act in his film titled Thirumagan. There were rumours that Suryah and Meerajasmine were dating, which was eventually denied by Suryah. During the shooting, Suryah had a misunderstanding with Rathnakumar, and many of the crew claimed that they felt difficult to work with the director.

Soundtrack
The music was composed by Deva, with lyrics written by Vairamuthu.
