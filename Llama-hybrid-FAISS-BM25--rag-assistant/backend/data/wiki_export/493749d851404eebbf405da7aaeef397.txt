The St. Marys Lincolns are a junior ice hockey team based in St. Marys, Ontario, Canada.  They play in the Western division of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League.

History

Founded in 1956, the Lincolns have never missed a season. The team survived a rather revolutionary era in Ontario hockey. In 1964, they walked away from the old Western Ontario Junior B Hockey League and joined the Central Junior B Hockey League to avoid the eventual jump the Western made to Junior A. The Lincolns joined the current Western Junior "B" league in 1969.

Behind the Waterloo Siskins, the Lincolns are the second oldest Junior "B" team in all of Ontario.
