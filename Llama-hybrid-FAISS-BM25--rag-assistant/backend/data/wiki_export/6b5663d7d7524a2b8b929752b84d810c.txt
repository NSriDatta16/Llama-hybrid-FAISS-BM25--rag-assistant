The Olympic Gymnastics Arena (), also known as the KSPO Dome since 2018, is an indoor arena located within the Olympic Park in Seoul, South Korea. It has a capacity of 15,000.

It was constructed between 31 August 1984 and 30 April 1986, to host the gymnastics competitions at the 1988 Summer Olympics. The roof was designed by David H. Geiger. It is a self-supporting cable dome – the first of its kind ever built – with a four-layer fabric cladding.

History
Since the Olympics it has hosted a variety of events, notably as a concert venue for both South Korean and international artists.

The arena is also infamous due to an incident on 17 February 1992 when American boy band New Kids on the Block abruptly halted their performance after 20 minutes due to a fatal human crush incident where female Korean teenagers swarmed the band to the stage. One person was killed and about 50 people treated for injuries.
