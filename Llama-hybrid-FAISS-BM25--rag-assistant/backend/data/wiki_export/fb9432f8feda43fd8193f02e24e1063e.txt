Urmila () is a princess featured in the Ramayana. She is the daughter of King Janaka of Mithila and Queen Sunayana. Sita, the female protagonist of the epic, is her elder adoptive sister. She becomes the wife of Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rama. She is considered to be an incarnation of Nagalakshmi.

Legend 
Urmila was married to King Dasharatha's third son, Lakshmana. They had two sons named Angada and Chandraketu. She is described as being as dedicated to Sita as Lakshmana was to Rama. 

When Lakshmana joined Rama and Sita in their exile, Urmila was ready to accompany him, but he hesitated and asked her to stay back in Ayodhya to take care of his aging parents. According to a legend, Urmila slept continuously for fourteen years. It is believed that during these fourteen years of exile, her husband also never slept to protect his brother and sister-in-law. On the first night of exile, when Rama and Sita were sleeping, the deity Nidra appeared to Lakshmana, and he requested her to offer him the boon of not requiring sleep. The goddess asked him that she could grant his wish, but someone else would have to take his place asleep. Lakshmana wondered if his wife could sleep instead of him. After hearing this, Nidra enquired Urmila regarding this, and the latter happily accepted the task. Urmila is notable for this unparalleled sacrifice, which is called Urmila Nidra.

According to another legend, it is said that when Lakshmana came to inform Urmila of his decision to join Rama in his exile, she was dressed as a queen. Lakshmana grew angry with her and compared her with Kaikeyi. This is stated to be a deliberate act of provocation to alleviate Lakshmana's guilt of leaving her behind so that he could take care of her brother and sister-in-law. When Sita learned of this, she remarked that hundreds of her would not be able to match Urmila's sacrifice. 

According to some puranas, she also along  with Lakshman had taken Jal samadhi. She is also considered as the goddess of sacrifice. According to Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas, After Sita death  Ayodhya got  curse that  no Suhagan women will alive so Urmila Mandvi and Shrutakriti along with Suhagan womens of Ayodhya took Samadhi  in Saryu river after that she become nagalakshmi and went vaikunth
