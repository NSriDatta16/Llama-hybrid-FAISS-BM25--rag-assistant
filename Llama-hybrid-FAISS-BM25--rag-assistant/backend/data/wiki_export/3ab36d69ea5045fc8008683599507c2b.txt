Troy McIntosh (born March 29, 1973) is a male sprinter from The Bahamas. He represented his nation at the Summer Olympics in 1996 and 2000. He had his greatest achievements with the Bahamian 4Ã—400 metres relay team. He won the bronze medal in that event at the 2000 Summer Olympics after the United States team were retrospectively disqualified due to doping. This same disqualification, of Antonio Pettigrew, also resulted in Bahamas taking the gold medal at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, where McIntosh was initially a silver medallist.

Individually he was the bronze medallist in the 400 metres at the 1998 IAAF World Cup and the champion at the 1998 Central American and Caribbean Games. He ran an indoor Bahamian record of 46.05 seconds at the 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where he finished fourth.
