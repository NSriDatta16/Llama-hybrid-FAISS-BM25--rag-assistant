Dame Angela Claire Rosemary Rumbold  (née Jones; 11 August 1932 – 19 June 2010) was a British Conservative politician who served as the Member of Parliament from a 1982 by-election until the 1997 general election.

Education

Marriage and early career 
She married John Rumbold, a solicitor, by whom she had two sons and a daughter and, , seven grandchildren.

She returned to a working life after raising her children and worked as the Chief Executive for a charity, The National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital.

In 1982, Bruce Douglas-Mann, the MP for Mitcham and Morden, left the Labour Party to join the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He decided to resign as an MP and seek re-election under the SDP banner. The resulting by-election was held during the Falklands War and was won by Rumbold. She held the seat for the Conservatives in the landslide 1983 general election and for a further 14 years, usually with robust majorities.
