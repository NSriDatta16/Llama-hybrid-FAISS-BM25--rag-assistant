The 2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup was a ten-race series that commenced with the Sylvania 300 on September 17, 2006, at New Hampshire International Speedway and concluded with the Ford 400 on November 19 of that same year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The first ten drivers in the championship standings (and any other drivers with teams within 400 points of the leader) qualified after the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 on September 9, 2006, at Richmond International Raceway. The 2006 Chase had a strong Chevrolet presence, with seven of the ten teams making the 2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup fielding Chevrolets.

This was the final season for NBC to cover the Chase along with TNT. Starting in 2007, ABC carried the Chase in its entirety, while TNT televised mid-season races.

UAW Ford 500

At this year's event, David Gilliland won his first career Bud Pole Award, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. led the most laps.

Johnson moved down low to pass Earnhardt, and his teammate Vickers followed, but accidentally caught the right rear quarter panel of Johnson's Chevrolet. Johnson spun up into Earnhardt's car, sending both of them down into the infield grass. Vickers moved past and took his first career victory, amid boos from Earnhardt's and Johnson's fans.

Trivia
 Denny Hamlin became the first rookie to make the Chase for the Cup.
 Tony Stewart did not make the Chase for the Cup this year. This marked the first time since the chase format was implemented in 2004 that the defending champion did not clinch a spot. However, he won three of the Chase races en route to a $1 million (US) bonus as the best finisher not among the drivers participating in the Chase. In both years, the winner of the regular season did not make the next year's Chase.
 Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth, and Mark Martin returned for their third consecutive chase, while Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr. entered their second chase and Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, Kasey Kahne, Kyle Busch, and Jeff Burton all qualified for their first chase.
 Jeremy Mayfield, Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch and Tony Stewart made the first two chases but failed to make this year's playoff, with Mayfield without a team after being released by Evernham Motorsports in August.
 The top three finishers of the 2005 Chase did not qualify for the 2006 chase. (#1 Tony Stewart, #2 Greg Biffle, and #3 Carl Edwards)
