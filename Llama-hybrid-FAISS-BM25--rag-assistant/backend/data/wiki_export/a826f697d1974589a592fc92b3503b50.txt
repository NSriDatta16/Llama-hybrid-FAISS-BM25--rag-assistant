Cedric Laquon Killings (December 14, 1977 – June 21, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL).

Career-ending injury
Killings was involved in a head-to-head collision by Roy Hall during the second quarter of a game against the Indianapolis Colts on September 23, 2007, and had to be taken off the field in a stretcher. Trainers said he was complaining of numbness in his lower extremities, and was unable to move them. He had suffered a fractured vertebra.  He also sustained a deep cut under his right eye. A Houston Methodist Hospital spokesperson said that Killings could move all of his extremities but was complaining of numbness coming and going in his lower back area.

NFL rule change
The Texans' Harry Williams, a receiver, and Cedric Killings, a defensive lineman, both saw their careers end in sudden, frightening fashion because of wedge-related neck injuries during the 2007 season.

The NFL's rules were subsequently changed. They now state that once the ball has been kicked, no more than two receiving team players can be within 2 yards of each other on the same yard line, or to quote Texans special teams coach Joe Marciano, "shoulder pad to shoulder pad."

"Everybody else has to be 3 yards away," Marciano said. "So we're telling our guys 4 yards to stay out of any gray area. The penalty is just too severe to take chances."

Violation of this rule will result in a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Personal life and death
Killings and his wife, Shavon, had three children.

Killings died of pancreatic cancer on June 21, 2023, at the age of 45.
