This is a bibliography of works by American writer John W. Campbell Jr.

The bibliography is in chronological order of first publication of the books.  In most cases only first editions are shown for each title, with the following exceptions.  Both British and US editions are shown for Who Goes There? as the title was changed.  The Moon is Hell was released both as a novel and a short story collection; both versions are shown.  Some confusing variants are shown in full for the Astounding Science Fiction Anthology and its derivatives; the situation is explained more fully in that section.  Some other variant titles are listed separately, with notes indicating what the original titles were.

The main bibliographic sources are footnoted from this paragraph and provided much of the information in the following sections.,,,,  Some footnotes annotating specific points are provided at the appropriate places below.

Novels and fixups
The Mightiest Machine. Providence, Rhode Island: Hadley Publishing Company, 1947; hardcover.  Originally serialized over five issues in Astounding, starting in December 1934.
The Incredible Planet. Reading: Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1949; hardcover.  Three linked novellas: "The Incredible Planet", "The Interstellar Search", and "The Infinite Atom", originally written as sequels to The Mightiest Machine but rejected by Tremaine for publication in Astounding.  This is their first publication, so the book is not a fixup in the usual sense, although the stories were not originally intended for publication as a novel.
The Moon is Hell.  London: New English Library, 1975; paperback.  See the entry in the short story collection section below.
The Black Star Passes.  Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1953; hardcover.  Fixup of three stories in Campbell's "Arcot, Morey and Wade" series, all from 1930: "Piracy Preferred", "Solarite", and "The Black Star Passes".
Islands of Space. Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1956; hardcover.  Originally published in Amazing Stories Quarterly, Spring 1931.
Invaders from the Infinite. Hicksville, New York: Gnome Press, 1961; hardcover simultaneous with: Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1961; hardcover.  Originally published in Amazing Stories Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1932.  Note that the Gnome Press and Fantasy Press editions were very limited in release.  The Reginald Index lists the Fantasy Press as the first edition but this is apparently incorrect.  Both the Tuck Encyclopedia and the Chalker-Owings History list the editions as simultaneous.  It was to have been a Fantasy Press project, but was handed off to Gnome when the Fantasy Press folded.  Lloyd Eshbach of Fantasy Press printed the copies for both editions, including 100 that he did for longtime customers.
The Ultimate Weapon.  New York: Ace Books, Inc., 1966; paperback.  Bound dos-a-dos with Campbell's The Planeteers, as Ace Double G-585; see below.  Originally serialized in the October and November 1936 Astoundings as Uncertainty.
 "Who Goes There?" Novellete originally published in Astounding, August 1938.

The Nicholls Encyclopedia mentions a 1952 chapbook, published in Australia, as the first edition of Who Goes There? as a standalone novel, but provides no bibliographic details.  The story itself first saw book form in the 1948 Shasta collection; see below.

Short story collections and omnibus editions
Who Goes There?.  Chicago: Shasta Publishers, 1948; hardcover.  Collection of seven stories.
The Moon Is Hell!.  Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1951; hardcover.  Contains The Moon Is Hell! and also "The Elder Gods", which was originally published in the October 1939 Unknown as by Don A. Stuart, but which was actually a collaboration between John Campbell and Arthur J. Burks according to Contento.  Chalker reports that Campbell purchased the story from Burks in order to use the concept.  Note that this same title is listed above as a novel, since all later editions dropped this short story.  The Tuck Encyclopedia and the Chalker History give the first edition as "Fantasy, 1950", whereas the Currey bibliography gives the first edition as "Fantasy Press, 1951".  There does not seem to be support for the Tuck/Chalker date in other sources.

The Thing and Other Stories. London: Fantasy Books, 1952; paperback.  Reprint of the 1948 Shasta edition of Who Goes There?.

Other
Empire. New York: World Editions, 1951; paperback.  Written (and bylined) by Clifford Simak from Campbell's plot.  The book was apparently written by Campbell as a teenager; he was unable to find a publisher for it and turned it over to Simak to rewrite it for Astounding.  Simak said of the book that "Empire was essentially a rewrite of John's plot.  I may have taken a few of the ideas and action, but I didn't use any of his words.  And I certainly tried to humanize his characters".  Simak's version was, ironically, rejected by Campbell, and finally appeared in the Galaxy Novel series from World Editions. Currey indicates here that the quote from Simak is "via Muriel Becker", without giving more details.  There is a Simak bibliography by Muriel R. Becker, which may be the source: Clifford D. Simak: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography; Boston, G. K. Hall & Co.; 1980.

The situation with regard to The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology and its reprints is confusing enough to warrant a separate discussion.  The original anthology, published by Simon & Schuster in 1952, contained 23 stories, and an introduction by Campbell.  There have been three separate reissues of these stories in two volumes.  The first was done by Grayson & Grayson, in 1954, as The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology (seven stories) and The Second Science Fiction Anthology (eight stories).  This selection omitted the introduction (as did all the later editions) and also omitted eight of the stories.  Then in 1956 and 1957 Berkley issued two paperback selections.  The first, with serial number G-41, had the same title as the original, 'The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology', but included only eight stories.  This was re-released in 1967 under the title Selections From the Astounding Science Fiction Anthology.  The second Berkley anthology, which had serial number G-47, was Astounding Tales of Space and Time; this selected another seven stories; again eight stories were omitted, although not the same eight as omitted by the Grayson books: Berkley included five stories not printed in the Grayson versions of the anthology, and omitted five that Grayson did print.  Finally, in 1964 and 1965, Four Square printed a third version, again in two volumes, and with the same titles as the Grayson books: The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology and The Second Astounding Science Fiction Anthology.  The first volume contained eleven stories, and the second twelve stories; this version reprinted everything from the original 1952 one-volume edition except for Campbell's introduction.
