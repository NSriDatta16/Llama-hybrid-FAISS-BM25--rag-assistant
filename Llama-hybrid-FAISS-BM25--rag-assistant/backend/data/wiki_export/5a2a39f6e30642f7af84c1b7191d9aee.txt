Magija () is the eighth studio album by Serbian singer Jelena Karleuša. Released on 22 February 2005, it was Karleuša's first studio album under City Records. Most of the tracks are covers to songs created by Phoebus. The lyrics were written by Marina Tucaković. The production was handled by Nebojša Arežina and Marko Peruničić from Atelje Trag, who were also involved in songwriting.

Background 
In February 2004, Karleuša competed in the Beovizija 2004 with the song "Moli me" in order to represent Serbia and Montenegro in Eurovision Song Contest. She ultimately finished in 11th place out of 28 entries, and thus failed to qualify for the grand final.

The album was promoted with music videos for the songs "Slatka mala" and "Upravo ostavljena". Both videos generated controversy in the conservative groups by respectively featuring drag queens and a scene of Karleuša crucified. The latter according to Kareluša meant to represent her position in public life. Serbian magazine Vreme likened Karleuša's "shocking" image in the music videos to Madonna.
