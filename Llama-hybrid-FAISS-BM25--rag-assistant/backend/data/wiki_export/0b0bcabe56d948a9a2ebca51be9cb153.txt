Housing 
Erimus Housing is the main housing provider, managing the social housing which in the past was owned by Middlesbrough Council. The housing stock has gone through several stages in the evolution of netherfields. Most housing is traditional, 1960s terraced houses, but there have also been rows of flats with communal stairways, demolished in the 1980s, and several blocks of high-rise flats.

In 2009, two of Netherfields' three high-rise blocks of flats were demolished, after a lengthy consultation with Netherfields' residents. The flats, which were built in 1968, each contained 90 flats. Concerns from residents indicated problems within each of the blocks, which experienced high levels of anti-social behaviour and were becoming increasingly difficult to let. The demolition was carried out by the use of explosives, and provided a spectacle for those who came to watch. After the demolition, Erimus Housing made improvements to the remaining block of flats, Welton House, which included new kitchens, bathrooms, rewiring and new double glazed units.
