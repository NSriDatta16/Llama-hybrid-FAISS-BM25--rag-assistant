is a business district of Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan, situated in between the Ginza and Hibiya Park, southeast of the Tokyo Imperial Palace. The district takes its name from Oda Nagamasu (1547–1622), who was also known as Yūraku (有楽). Oda Nagamasu built his mansion here on land granted by Tokugawa Ieyasu near the Sukiya-bashi Gate of Edo Castle. The place name dates from the Meiji period.

Yūrakuchō is served by several train and subway stations, including Hibiya Station (Toei Subway and Tokyo Metro lines) and Yūrakuchō Station (JR East and Tokyo Metro lines).

Unlike its tonier neighbor Ginza, Yūrakuchō provides a glimpse of Japanese life from the early postwar period, with its many izakaya (Japanese-style bars, denoted by their red lanterns known as akachochin) and outdoor yakitori restaurants, many of which are located near or under the train tracks serving Tokyo's JR Yamanote Line. Because of its easy access to Tokyo Station, Yūrakuchō bars and restaurants are popular among businessmen on their way home from work.

The administrative Yūrakuchō district also covers the Hibiya area.

History
In 1707, the Tokugawa shogunate established the Minami-machi Bugyō-sho, the office of one of the magistrates of Edo, in this area. 
The place name dates from the Meiji period. It arises from an altered pronunciation of Urakusai.
