National Institute of Technology Agartala (NIT Agartala or NITA) is a technology-oriented institute of higher education established by India's Ministry of Human Resource Development Government of India in Agartala, India. It was founded as Tripura Engineering College in 1965 and declared a National Institute of Technology (NIT) in 2006, thus being recognized as an Institute of National Importance.

The institute was established in 1965 as Tripura Engineering College, with the branches of civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering. It was initially affiliated with Calcutta University and had the same curriculum structure and examination system as Bengal Engineering College (currently IIEST Shibpur).

After the establishment of Tripura University in 1987, the institute was affiliated with it. Courses toward a degree in computer science and engineering were offered beginning in the 1999–2000 session, and three new degrees were offered beginning in the 2005–06 session: Electrical & Electronics, Production and Transportation Engineering.

On 23 February 2006, the Union Cabinet approved the proposal of the state government for the conversion of Tripura Engineering College to the National Institute of Technology.

History
The institute was converted from Tripura Engineering College, a State Engineering College, to a National Institute of Technology in 2006 |url https://www.nita.ac.in/| . To better reflect this new status, the total seats were increased from 250 to 420 for the academic session 2007 2008 and undergraduate courses were introduced in electrical and electronics engineering, transportation engineering and production engineering. The Civil Engineering Department started a postgraduate programme in structural engineering to fulfill a state requirement. The campus, which had been nonresidential, was made residential for the 2007 2008 session with the reopening of two boys' hostels and one girls' hostel. The institute is built over 365.6 acres (1.48 km2) of land.
