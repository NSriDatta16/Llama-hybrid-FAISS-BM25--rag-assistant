Moselle is an unincorporated community in Franklin County, Missouri, United States. It is located approximately five miles northeast of St. Clair.

Moselle had its start in 1849 when a blast furnace was built at the site. The community most likely was named after Moselle, France. A post office called Moselle was established in 1860, and remained in operation until 1971.

The Moselle Iron Furnace Stack was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.
