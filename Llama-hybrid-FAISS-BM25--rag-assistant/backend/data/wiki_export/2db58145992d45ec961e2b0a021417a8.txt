The Axilrodâ€“Teller potential in molecular physics, is a three-body potential that results from a third-order perturbation correction to the attractive London dispersion interactions (instantaneous induced dipole-induced dipole)

where  is the distance between atoms  and , and  is the angle between the vectors
 and .  The coefficient   is positive and of the order , where  is the ionization energy and  is the mean atomic polarizability; the exact value of  depends on the magnitudes of the dipole matrix elements and on the energies of the  orbitals.
