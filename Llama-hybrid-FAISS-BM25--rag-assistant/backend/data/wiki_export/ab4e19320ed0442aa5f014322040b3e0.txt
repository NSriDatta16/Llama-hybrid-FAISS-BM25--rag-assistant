La Sexta (; "The Sixth"; stylized as laSexta) is a privately owned Spanish free-to-air television channel that was founded on 18 March 2001 as Beca TV and began broadcasting on 1 April 2001. By 21 July 2003, the channel ran into debt and was shut down, but two years later in 2005, it was replaced by a new channel called La Sexta that began test transmissions on 25 November 2005, and a year later, it started broadcasting officially on 27 March 2006. The channel's programming is generalist, however, there is an emphasis on humour and entertainment. The channel broadcasts a large amount of American and sports programming, and in recent years it has covered political events such as elections, including extensive debate through three key programmes: Al rojo vivo (Red-hot), El objetivo (The lens) and Salvados (Saved). The political alignment of its news and debate programs is left-leaning.

In 2012 the channel was acquired by Grupo Antena 3, later named Atresmedia Televisión.

Programming

LaSexta's programming from Monday to Friday is mainly based on information and debate spaces, although more general programming such as movies, reality shows or reporting programs are broadcast at night.

History
La Sexta was first founded as a TV production company on 25 November 2005 when it got its broadcast license. It began testing the broadcast on 12 December, shortly before knowing the analog frequencies assigned to Madrid and Barcelona.

On 23 December, broadcasts started in Madrid and Barcelona, expanding later to all Spain.

Starting 23 January 2006 they began broadcasting a promotional video. 20 February marked the start of content emissions testing. Actual broadcasts started with documentaries (Champions, Natura) and programs dedicated to tuning, like 'Tuning Mania'. From 22 February, La Sexta broadcast twelve hours of programming every day.

On 2 March, a football match between Croatia and Argentina was the occasion for the first live broadcast. Five days before the actual date, José Miguel Contreras announced the official starting date, 27 March, on the Círculo de Bellas Artes.
