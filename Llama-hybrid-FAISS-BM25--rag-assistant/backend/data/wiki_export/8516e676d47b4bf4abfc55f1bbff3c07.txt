The Toyota Fortuner, also known as the Toyota SW4, is a mid-size SUV manufactured by the Japanese automaker Toyota since 2004. Built on the Hilux pickup truck platform, it features two/three rows of seats and is available in either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive configuration. It is a part of Toyota's IMV project for emerging markets, which also includes the Hilux and the Innova.

The name Fortuner is derived from the English word fortune.

Production 
While the first-generation Fortuner was developed in Thailand by Thai and Japanese engineers, its facelifted version, as well as the Hilux and Innova, was designed in Australia by Toyota Australia, which is also responsible for developing the second-generation model.

For the medium body-on-frame SUV segment, Toyota offers the Hilux Surf/4Runner (Japan/North America) and the Land Cruiser Prado (Europe and Australasia). However, in some Central and South American countries and New Zealand, Toyota offers the Fortuner alongside the 4Runner and/or Prado, like in Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala.

Specialised variants with a naturally-aspirated 5L-E diesel engine is offered to governments, organisations and the UN alongside other utility vehicles such as the Prado, Hilux, HiAce, and the 70 and 200 series Land Cruisers.

First generation (AN50/AN60; 2004)

The first generation Fortuner was unveiled in December 2004 at the Thailand International Motor Expo and was available for sale in early 2005. It is positioned below the Land Cruiser and above the RAV4.

At first, the Fortuner was sold with 4 different types of 2 petrol engines and 2 diesel engines. All variants were offered in 4×2 (RWD) or 4×4 configuration, with 5-speed manual transmission and a 4 or 5-speed automatic transmission. In August 2012, the 2.5-litre common-rail turbodiesel 2KD-FTV engine was upgraded to a variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) which was already equipped in the 3.0-litre common-rail turbo diesel 1KD-FTV since its introduction in 2005 to increase power and torque about 60%, also reducing fuel consumption up to 30%. With this VNT equipment, the Fortuner could now accelerate from  in about 11 seconds (less than 10 seconds for 3.0-litre engine). It was launched to commemorate Pertamina's successful expedition from Jakarta, Indonesia to Rome, Italy (a distance of roughly ) using a group of Fortuners.

Variants 
A number of engine options are available depending on the country of sale, including a 2.7-litre 2TR-FE and 4.0-litre 1GR-FE V6 petrol with Variable Valve Timing and 2.5-litre 2KD-FTV and 3.0-litre 1KD-FTV common rail variable geometry turbocharger diesel models.

Grade levels are G and G Luxury for rear-wheel drive diesel and petrol, and V for 4×4 Diesel and petrol. The common rail turbo intercooled diesel has a functional scoop on its hood.

In 2007, Toyota Thailand dropped the 4×4 petrol model and replaced it with a two-wheel drive petrol version.

Facelifts

Second generation (AN150/AN160; 2015) 

The second generation Fortuner was unveiled simultaneously on 16 July 2015 in Australia and Thailand. Along with the Hilux, the Fortuner features the "Keen Look" design language. Both the Hilux and Fortuner share the chassis, transmission and engine lineup, with two new diesel engines from the GD series. The 2.7-litre and 4.0-litre petrol engines were updated with Dual VVT-i. The second-generation Fortuner features a part-time 4×4 system instead of the full-time 4×4 system used in the previous generation.

The development of the vehicle was led by executive chief engineer Hiroki Nakajima. Despite sharing the hood panels, front pillar area, windscreen glass and front doors as the Hilux, the exterior of the Fortuner has been described as more slim-looking, featuring slim headlights with bi-beam LED projector as an option and blacked-out D-pillars for a "floating roof" look. Toyota designers drew inspiration from their own Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser Prado heritage, as a means of differentiating the Fortuner from competing body-on-frame SUV rivals.

Since this generation, the Fortuner no longer shares the interior design with the Hilux to give a 'distinct character' between the two. As the result, the interior took an upwards step in perceived quality with an upright dashboard design with synthetic leather trims with stitching, a three-spoke steering wheel shared with the Hilux and a modern instrument cluster with a large colour TFT LCD multi-info display.

The Fortuner also features larger cross sections for its ladder frame, and sits on double wishbone front suspension and five-link rear suspension with coil springs. The rear differential lock also has its componentry placed within the differential housing for improved off-road protection.

All variants are equipped with ABS, EBD, dual airbags plus knee airbag, "follow me home" light function, all around sensor, glove box with chiller function, digital automatic climate control, all auto power windows along with tilt and telescopic steering wheel as standard. All variants also have Eco Mode and Power Mode features to adjust throttle responses. The front braking system consists of 17" disc brakes, whilst the rear braking system uses drum brakes, except in Australia and India where disc brakes are used all around. In 2017, the Fortuner was upgraded to disc brakes all around in all markets. In the third row, the 50:50 split seats continue to flips up onto the body side while being folded instead of folding flat into the floor like on most of its competitors.

Powertrain 
The Fortuner is powered by a range of petrol and diesel engines. The two GD series engines are newly developed for this generation, which feature common-rail direct-injection and variable nozzle turbocharging; the 2.8-litre also gets auto start-stop in some markets. The 2.7-litre petrol engine is lighter and equipped with Dual VVT-i, improved combustion and less friction.
