History 

The County of Schwalenberg was first mentioned with count Widekind I in 1127. The original seat of the counts had been Oldenburg Castle at Marienmünster. The monastery of Marienmünster was founded by the counts in 1128. Schwalenberg Castle was built between 1228 and 1231 by count Volkwin III. During the 13th century the territory of the counts was split between several branches, creating the county of Schwalenberg itself (then mainly restricted to a small territory around Schwalenberg Castle), the county of Pyrmont (existing from 1194 until 1495), the county of Waldeck (existing as a principality until 1918) and the county of Sternberg (existing from 1243 until 1377, later disputed between the counts of Schaumburg and the counts of Lippe). When the Schwalenberg branch extinguished in 1365, its territory was divided between the House of Lippe (which used Schwalenberg Castle as a seat of junior branches and later distributed parts of the county to its branches Lippe-Biesterfeld and Lippe-Weissenfeld), and the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn.
