Birote Khurd is a subdivision of Berote Kalan Union Council in Pakistan.

History 
As part of the local government reforms of 2000, Berote Khurd lost the status of Union Council and was merged into Berote Kalan.

Etymology
The name of the union council "Birote or Berote Khurd" means lesser Birote, differentiating it from the larger settlement of "Birote Kalan". The words Khurd and Kalan (little and big) are administrative terminology dating back to Mughal times â€“ to differentiate two areas with the same name, hence Birote Khurd means little birote (cf. Britannia major, "Greater Britain" and Britannia minor "Lesser Britain").

Berote Khurd is located in the east part of Abbottabad District in the North West Frontier Province. To the east is the Birote Kallan and Kashmir region and in the west Nathiagalli areas, to the south is Pluck and to the north is the Bakot area. Birote Khurd lies in the foothills of famous Mushkpuri peaks of the Galyat Region.
