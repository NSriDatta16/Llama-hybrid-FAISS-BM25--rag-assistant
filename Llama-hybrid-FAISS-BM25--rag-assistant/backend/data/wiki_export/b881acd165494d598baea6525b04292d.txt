Background 

Prior to the 2006 Contest, Germany had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty-nine times since its debut as one of seven countries to take part in . Germany has won the contest on one occasion: in 1982 with the song "Ein bißchen Frieden" performed by Nicole. Germany, to this point, has been noted for having competed in the contest more than any other country; they have competed in every contest since the first edition in 1956 except for the 1996 contest when the nation was eliminated in a pre-contest elimination round. In 2005, the German entry "Run & Hide" performed by Gracia placed last out of twenty-four competing songs scoring four points.

The German national broadcaster, ARD, broadcasts the event within Germany and delegates the selection of the nation's entry to the regional broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR). NDR confirmed that Germany would participate in the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest on 22 May 2005. Since 1996, NDR had set up national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Germany. On 29 November 2005, the broadcaster announced that they would organise a multi-artist national final to select the 2006 German entry.
