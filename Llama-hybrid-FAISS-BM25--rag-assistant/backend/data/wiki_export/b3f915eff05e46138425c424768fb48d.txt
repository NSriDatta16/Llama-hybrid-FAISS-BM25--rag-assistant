Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue  is situated in Stanmore in the London Borough of Harrow, England, and had the largest community of any single Orthodox synagogue in Europe as of 2012. It is a constituent of the United Synagogue (mainstream Orthodox).

History

The congregation became affiliated with United Synagogue in 1946, becoming a district synagogue in 1952 and subsequently a constituent (member) synagogue.

Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has previously been called "Stanmore and Canons Park District Synagogue" and "Canons Park & District Hebrew Congregation".
 The current building (Main Shul) was consecrated on 18 March 1951 (Jewish Date: 10th Adar 5711) by Dayan Dr I. Grunfeld and Isaac Wolfson Esq. The Synagogue was actually built facing north rather than east (towards Jerusalem).
 The community centre was consecrated on 8 September 1963. The Freeman Susman Hall (above the community centre) is actually bigger than the main synagogue itself.
 The corridor between the main synagogue and the community centre was widened in an extension in 2002. As part of the extension a garden was established at the front of the building.
 The synagogue added a lift in 2008 so that disabled members could access all parts of the building.
 In 2014 the main shul was refurbished as well as half of the classrooms.

Rabbis

Mendel Lew became senior rabbi in 2006.

Avrom Chaitowitz (1921–1986) was minister from 1954 to 1986.

Cohen is an author of theological works as well as over two hundred articles in popular journals and newspapers. He has published more than 25 books in the past 30 years, the most recent being The Psalms: Poetry in Poetry (2018) and Genesis in Poetry (2019), both published by Wipf & Stock, Oregon, USA.
