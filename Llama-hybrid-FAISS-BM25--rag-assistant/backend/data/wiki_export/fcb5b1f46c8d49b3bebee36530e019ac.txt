Jonathan Morris (born in Taunton, England), is an author who writes various kinds of Doctor Who spin-off material. In 2023 he stood for election to Winchester City Council as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the St Barnabas Ward and won with 58% of vote.

Career

Writing

His path to prominence in writing professional Doctor Who fiction was notable in part because he was commissioned to write a novel after only his first attempt under the
BBC's "Open Submission" policy.

He has written for the Eighth Doctor Adventures and Past Doctor Adventures. He has also written for Big Finish Productions' range of audio and printed material. Among
his Doctor Who literary credits are short stories in the Big Finish Short Trips anthologies; the novels Festival of Death, Anachrophobia,
and The Tomorrow Windows; and the audio adventures Bloodtide, Flip-Flop, Max Warp,
The Haunting of Thomas Brewster, A Perfect World, Mary's Story, Hothouse,
The Cannibalists, The Eternal Summer, Protect and Survive and 1963: The Space Race. Festival of Death
received 2000's "Best Past Doctor Novel" award from the readers of Doctor Who Magazine. Morris contributed "The Clanging Chimes of Doom" to
Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury, "Lant Land" to Short Trips: Life Science, "The Thief of Sherwood" to Short Trips: Past Tense, and "Mauritz" to
Short Trips: A Universe of Terrors. His debut novel, Festival of Death, was placed seventh in the Top 10 of SFX magazine's "Best SF/Fantasy novelisation
or TV tie-in novel" category of 2000.

In 2005, he wrote the narration script for the documentary "Paris in the Springtime", a homage to Douglas Adams' work on Doctor Who, which was included in the BBC DVD
release of the serial City of Death.

In addition to his Doctor Who work, he has also written for Big Finish's Judge Dredd range, contributing the title, I Love Judge Dredd.
For the Bernice Summerfield series of anthologies he has contributed the short stories "The Spartacus Syndrome" (in A Life of Surprises) and "The Traitors" (in
Life During Wartime). In 2011, he contributed to their Dark Shadows range with The Blind Painter
and Operation Victor.

In 2005, some of his writing was included in the televised British sketch/situation comedy fusion, Swinging.
