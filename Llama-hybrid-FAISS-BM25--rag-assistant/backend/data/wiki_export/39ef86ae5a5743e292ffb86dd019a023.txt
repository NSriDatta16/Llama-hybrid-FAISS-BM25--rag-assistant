Bangoura quickly became a fan favourite, and established himself as a goal scorer. He was known to celebrate goals with teammate and Senegalese international defender Pape Diakhaté, resembling an African dance.

Playing in Kyiv gave Bangoura the chance to showcase his abilities in European competition, with the team playing in the 2007–08 season. The forward made the most of the opportunity, scoring three goals in three games for the Ukrainians, including a 25-yard strike against Manchester United in his sides 4–2 defeat on 23 October 2007.

He scored his first goal on 16 September 2010 in a 3–1 win against Al-Ahli Dubai. During the 2010–11 season, he scored 10 goals from 17 league matches and was admired for his performances by Al Nasr and other Emirati clubs.

Early in the 2011–12 season, he decided to move away temporarily from the club for African Nations Cup in January 2012, which could see him unavailable for almost two months. Al Nasr accepted his decision, but did not wait for him. Bangoura was replaced by other players Brazilian Careca and Ivorian Amara Diané. Team manager Khalid Obaid explained that it was decided he would be away for too long and this wouldn't be of use to the team.

Nantes
Bangoura joined FC Nantes in French Ligue 2 on 31 January 2012 on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Al Nasr SC later sued Bangoura for unilaterally breach of contract. FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber confirmed the claim from the UAE club and ordered Bangoura and Nantes jointly liable to pay €4.5 million as compensation. Bangoura also banned for four months and Nantes was banned from making transfers in two consecutive transfer windows (summer and winter or one season). Both parties appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Before the FIFA DRC had a conclusion, on 10 September 2012, Bangoura joined Umm Salal in the Qatar Stars League on a temporary loan deal. He served the ban with the Qatari for about 2 months.
