Biography
Born in Barbados, Zeeteah moved to London with her parents when she was five years old. Her first name was originally spelled Zeitia. As a teenager she recorded a cover of The Jackson 5's We Got A Good Thing Going in a reggae style for RG Records. She went on to record two more reggae tracks for the label.

In 1984, Massiah appeared for nine months as Chiffon in the hit musical Little Shop of Horrors in London.

She has been an additional vocalist for artists including Barry Manilow and Boy George, and toured with Climie Fisher and Paul Weller. In 1988, she sang with Kim Wilde on the European leg of Michael Jackson's BAD tour and, in 1994/95, toured the world with Tom Jones. She has also toured extensively with Eikichi Yazawa and Johnny Hallyday, among the most successful rock stars in Japan and France respectively.

In 1993, Massiah was the lead vocalist on the Arizona track "Slide on the Rhythm", later remixed by C&C Music Factory, which was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Dance Chart in the US. She went on to record "I Specialise in Love" with Arizona, which was a UK chart hit.

On the back of her success with Arizona, Massiah signed a deal with Virgin Records, and released two singles: "Sexual Prime", which was a UK club hit, and "This Is The Place", which charted on the UK Singles Chart. In 1996 she was a UK finalist in the Eurovision Song Contest with "A Little Love".

In 2001, Massiah moved to Cologne, Germany, where she worked with a wide range of musicians, and recorded the single "Lovely Deep". During this time she spent nine months as featured singer in the hit show Fantissima, and spent three months touring Japan with Eikichi Yazawa.

In 2012, she returned to London to be with her partner Paul Caplin, and the two were married in 2016. Massiah performs regularly in London, playing songs composed by Caplin as well as her own interpretations of musical classics. She has released two albums produced by Caplin: Juice (2014), an album of original songs, and Maybe Tomorrow (2016), a collection of classics. The duo also released the single “All You” on 13 July 2018 under the name Caplin & Massiah.

On 4 February 2022 Massiah released “Wat A Ting”, the first single from her reggae album of the same name. The album itself was released on 18 November 2022. 

Massiah and Caplin are currently working on a new album of Afrobeats-influenced material.
