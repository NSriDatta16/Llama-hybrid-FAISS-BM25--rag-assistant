In 2005, he led Ecuador to their second consecutive World Cup. He has enjoyed hero status in Ecuador and Colombia, leading Ecuador to their best showing in a FIFA World Cup in 2006. Reaching the second round by inflicting defeats on Poland and Costa Rica, they lost to England 1–0 after a David Beckham free kick sailed into the net.

Suárez was offered to keep coaching the Ecuador national team till the next World Cup in 2010. Following a poor 2007 Copa América, many people wanted him out. Suárez stated that he would not resign and would improve his results. Suárez got off to the worst possible start for the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, losing 1–0 at home to Venezuela and receiving a 5–0 hammering by Brazil. After another hammering defeat 5–1 to Paraguay, he resigned irrevocably his position as head coach, immediately after the end of the match. On October 2009 he signed with Juan Aurich, a Peruvian football team.
