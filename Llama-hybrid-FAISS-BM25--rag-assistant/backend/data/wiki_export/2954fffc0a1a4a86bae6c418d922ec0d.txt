The Grand Erie District School Board (GEDSB, Originally known as Haldimand Norfolk Brant (English-language Public) District School Board No. 23 prior to May 1998)  is a school board that has legal jurisdiction over Norfolk County, Haldimand County, and Brant County in the province of Ontario, Canada. The main headquarters are in Brantford.

History
The board was formed from the amalgamation of the Norfolk Board of Education, the Brant County Board of Education, and the Haldimand Board of Education in 1998.  The announcement of the new board was made in September `997 as a part of the "Fewer School Boards Act." This was based on a report created in 1996 by the Bob Rae government; who recommended the changes. While the board was officially established on January 1, 1998, many of the administrative positions lasted until the beginning of May in 1998.

In 1998, under Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris' government, the way public schools were funded dramatically changed. Among the changes, the province replaced local boards' power to levy taxes to fund schools with a centralized system of education grants. The new regime was accompanied by a law forcing school boards to adopt balanced budgets. These changes contributed to school closures and consolidations in the Grand Erie Board.

The school teaches kindergarten through the eighth grade as in a typical parochial school. Due to its "Old Colony" name, Old Order and Conservative Mennonites tend to dominate the campus.

Closed schools
Walsingham Public School was an elementary school that educated in grades K-8, located in Walsingham Township, that was closed along with St. Williams Public School when consolidation review almagmated these two sites into the Port Rowan Public School. The schools were feeder schools to Valley Heights Secondary School. Due to the nearby presence of the Old Colony Mennonite School, which taught the local German Mennonite population, it had to attract students from both the northern and southern parts of Walsingham. Musician Geoff Suderman-Gladwell taught here.

North and South Public Schools were elementary schools in Simcoe, Ontario, that taught children from kindergarten to sixth grade. These schools were feeder schools to Elgin Avenue Public School. The schools were established in the 1928.  Windham Public School was closed in 2009. Students now attend either Delhi Public School or Teeterville public school, making both schools K-8 (formerly K-6). Nixon Public School was located near Simcoe, Ontario; it along with Lyndoch were closed and consolidated at an enlarged Walsh Elementary. Port Dover Public School served Port Dover, Ontario, and was a feeder school to Port Dover Composite School before being amalgamated into Doverwood Public School which subsequently was closed when Port Dover Composite was converted to Lakewood Elementary School.

Two of the schools located in Paris, Ontario, Bethel-Oakhill and Queen's Ward schools closed during the 2009–2010 school year and were replaced by Cobblestone Elementary School.

Walpole South Elementary School was a former K to 8 school located on Sandusk Rd south of the 3rd Concession of Walpole Township adjacent to the Nanticoke Refinery.  Opened in 1965 by the Walpole Board of Education amalgamated into the Haldimand County Board of Education in 1968, it was precipitously closed in June 1998 because of a Hydrogen Sulphide leak which occurred at the neighbouring refinery.  The students were housed at Hagersville Secondary school for the last few weeks of the school year and then the school population was amalgamated with Jarvis Public School that fall with use of portables until a new addition to house the extra students opening in February 2000.
