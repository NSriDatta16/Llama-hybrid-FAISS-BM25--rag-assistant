History
Les Roches is a hospitality school founded in 1979. Approximately 1118 students from 68 different countries attend every semester, with an additional 150 students on internship around the world at any given time.

The École des Roches, an international boarding school for young people, was founded in 1954 by Messrs Clivaz. In 1979, "Les Roches International School" became “Les Roches Hotel and Tourism School". It was the first hospitality school in Switzerland to offer all courses in English. In 2016 they became Les Roches Global Hospitality Education.

The main campus was destroyed by a fire in April 1985. This obliged the school to house students and facilities in three hotels. In June 1987, the school moved into its new buildings. In November 2000, Les Roches became part of the group now known as Laureate Education Inc. who also manages Glion Institute of Higher Education. 

It is now part of the Eurazeo portfolio and was part of the purchase of Sommet Education in June 2016.

The school maintains close ties with the hotel and tourism industry through a panel of advisors from four major hotel chains.
