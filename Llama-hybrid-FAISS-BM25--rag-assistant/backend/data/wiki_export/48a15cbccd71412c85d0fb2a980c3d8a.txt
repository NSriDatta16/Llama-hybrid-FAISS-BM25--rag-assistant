Snoddy was a six-part Scottish television sitcom, written and created by Johnny Crawford, that first broadcast on BBC One Scotland on 13 March 2002. The series, which aired at 10:35pm on Wednesdays, starred Gregor Fisher of Rab C Nesbitt fame as DCI Samuel J. Snoddy, the head of Scotland's Elite Crime Squad, who is obsessed with spending more time playing golf abroad rather than fighting crimes.

Only a single series of six episodes was broadcast, and the series was never shown outside of Scotland. The series was regarded as unsuccessful and was axed by BBC bosses following poor ratings. The series was heavily promoted in and around the Glasgow area, with a number of billboard posters portraying the tagline "it's a Hotel Oscar Oscar Tango of a show‚Äù being put up around the city. Notably, the series has never been made available on DVD.

Production
Snoddy was Johnny Crawford's first television writing credit, eventually being produced by The Comedy Unit for BBC One Scotland after first being offered to Channel 4 in 1998. Producer Colin Gilbert described Snoddy as Crawford's "rich, refreshing, and tangential left-field vision". Scripts for the series were subject to redrafting, with Gilbert commenting, "It's been a challenge for us to control everything into half-hour episodes that make narrative sense and are still funny. John's certainly had to work at making Snoddy just that bit easier for folk to follow, re-writing and re-writing, but he's become a much better writer as he's gone along."
