Plot

Twin siblings, brother Yori Yuki and sister Iku Yuki, had been extremely close since childhood. However, Yori's feelings toward Iku were more than innocent affection, and only grew stronger over time. Ashamed, Yori distances himself from Iku by pursuing a relationship with Iku's friend Tomoka Kusunoki and plans to transfer to an out-of-town high school. This does nothing to help him forget his lust for his sister, and when the twins get into an argument, Yori confesses his love to Iku. She initially rejects his advances, but fearing rejection may drive him away, she reluctantly kisses him. Yori tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him, and over the next several days, they try to begin a more intimate relationship, hidden from their parents.

Iku is torn between guilt at committing incest and her desire to remain together with Yori. However, when she discovers both Yori's relationship with Tomoka and his plans to leave, Iku realizes that she has fallen in love with him. She confesses to Yori, who accepts her feelings, breaking off his relationship with Tomoka. The twins then enter into a sexual relationship, and Yori is torn between elation and guilt. He maintains his plans to transfer to a different school, as he believes staying would prevent the two from acting like a normal couple. He suggests to Iku that they could keep their relationship if they lived somewhere no one knew them. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch.

Yori arrives at his new high school, while Iku begins living under the care of Yori's friend Haruka Yano and attending classes at a different school. Haruka is aware of their relationship and helps them meet in secret, but also begins to fall in love with Iku. When Haruka ultimately confesses to Iku, though, she rejects him. Tomoka is also enrolled at Yori's new school and tries to reinitiate their relationship, but he rejects her. Consequently, Tomoka plans her revenge against Yori. She attempts to get the twins caught visiting each other, and to blackmail Yori into sleeping with her. Although her attempts fail, she continues to plot against them, culminating in an attempt to have Iku raped by a group of classmates. In the process, Iku's visits are revealed, causing Yori to be expelled.

Yori transfers into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo Azusa, the daughter of one of their parents' friends, Dr. Yuugo Mori. She resembles Yori more than Iku, and when her father invites the Yuki family over to his house, Yori begins to suspect that Dr. Yuugo may have had an affair with his mother. Dr. Yuugo soon confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly confirms his suspicions with a DNA test. When confronted, the twins' mother admits to knowing that Yori is Yuugo's son, having kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Suspecting that Iku was adopted, and therefore not biologically related to him, Yori then reveals their relationship. Their mother insists that they are in fact siblings, and eventually reveals that they are in fact half-twins, the result of heteropaternal superfecundation. Iku is the daughter of her husband, while Yori the son of Yuugo Mori.

To avoid being separated, Yori and Iku run away from home with Haruka's help. While in hiding, Yori finally chooses to end their relationship and reconcile with their parents. He ultimately leaves the family to go somewhere he can never be found, hoping that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Iku falls into a deep depression and resolves to find him again, no matter how long it takes. Ten years later, Iku is a sales representative for a company owned by Haruka, from whom she has rejected several marriage proposals. During a trip to England, she encounters Yori once again; when they recognize each other, they embrace, and Yori asserts that he is still in love with Iku.

A reviewer for Manga News described the first volume of the manga as "a mature shojo, appealing and rather captivating." A review of the second volume of the manga commends the author's art as "very pretty." It also comments that the incestuous relationship "between those two brother and sister is sometimes pushed a bit too far, but that also gives charm to the character." PlaneteBD'''s Faustine Lillaz commented that the manga's art "barely saves the day. The trait is fine and the style rather pure and the background details are rarely present and when they are it is only to reinforce the forbidden aspect of Iku's and Yori's relationship (church, bedroom with parents outside)." Anime News Network described the manga as "Yori and Iku basically spend each chapter getting dangerously close with each other, often in explicit ways, and this smut is repeated over and over until you just want to read some conservative, pedantic pre-Tezuka shōjo manga about how little Chieko became a good obedient wife and waits every day to serve dinner to her salaryman husband because he gets so tired from perpetuating the Japanese economic miracle".

Anime
Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews criticized the hour length of the OVA, feeling its compression of the original manga story caused Yori's feelings for his sister to seem "extremely abrupt and out of left field". Noting that the OVA adaptation departed from the usual "incest taboo" setup, Ross considered the premise "Freudian" and "very unrealistic." Though he found the animation itself average, Ross praised the background art as varying "from gorgeous to amazing."
