Tai Poutini Polytechnic (TPP) is a company who aims to provide tertiary education meeting the needs of West Coast students and businesses. TPP's West Coast programmes include tourism and hospitality training across the retail and service sector, outdoor education training, agriculture, extractive/mining, and specialist jade and hard stone carving programmes.

TPP trains around 6,000 students every year in full or part-time study options. TPP's aim is to get their students into jobs in the local community, so they work with industry partners and local employers to ensure the training is suited to the needs of the West Coast. Training is provided local campuses in Greymouth and Westport, with on-site training at various locations across the region to ensure the students face real world work requirements.

In addition to their West Coast-based programmes, TPP also offers a range of national niche programmes at sites from Wānaka to Auckland, including: 
emergency management and search and rescue training through our Emergency Management Department;
industry training including scaffolding, industrial ropes, rigging, and cranes;
civil construction industry training;
ski patrol training based in Wānaka.
In 2017, TPP received a rating of 4 from the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, the worst rating received for a polytechnic institute. In 2018, the New Zealand based media company Stuff released an article about TPP criticizing Tai Poutini Polytechnic.

On 1 April 2020, Tai Poutini Polytechnic was subsumed into New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology alongside the 15 other Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs).
