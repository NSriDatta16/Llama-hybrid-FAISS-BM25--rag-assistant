Chi Lăng Stadium () was a multi-purpose stadium in Đà Nẵng, Vietnam.

Built on the banks of the Hàn River in 1954, the stadium played host to a number of memorable games, most notably Vietnam's 3–2 win over China at the 2000 AFC U-17 Championship, featuring goals from future star Phạm Văn Quyến.

The stadium was also used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Asian Beach Games.

The stadium was the home stadium of SHB Đà Nẵng of the V-League until 2016, when the club moved to the Hòa Xuân Stadium. The stadium was demolished in early 2018 to make way for two 33-story apartment complexes.
