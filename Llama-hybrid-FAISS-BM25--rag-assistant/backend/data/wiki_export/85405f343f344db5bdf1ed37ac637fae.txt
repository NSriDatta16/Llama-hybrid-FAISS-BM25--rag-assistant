Sakhi (Gurmukhi: ਸਾਖੀ; sākhī) literally means 'historical account', 'anecdote', or 'story'. It is derived from the Sanskrit word sākṣī (साक्षी) which literally means 'witness'.

The term refers to the accounts of the historical events in Sikhism. It is a tale usually from the era during the times of the Sikh Gurus and their devoted followers and associates. However, many Sakhis do exist from the period before and after the times of the Ten Gurus. Most Sakhis have a moral lesson and highlight important Sikh principles.

Compilation 
A collection of over five-hundred anecdotes from Sikh history was said to have been compiled in a work known as the Panj Sau Sakhi, which is now lost. An extant work titled Sau Sakhi contains a hundred anecdotes.
