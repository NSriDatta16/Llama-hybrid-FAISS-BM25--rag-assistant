History
The airport was built in 1957 to support the Distant Early Warning Line Radar station at Wainwright (LIZ-3). The station was logistically supported by the 711th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron based at Cape Lisburne Air Force Station, although Point Lay was operated by civilian contract workers.

The radar station was upgraded in the late 1980s with new radars and in 1989 was re-designated part of the North Warning System (NWS) as a Long Range Radar Site, A-16.
 The LRR site was inactivated in 2007 due to soil erosion and budget concerns.  The airport remains open to support the small settlement under the control of the  Pacific Air Forces Regional Support Center based at Joint Base Elmendorf–Richardson.
