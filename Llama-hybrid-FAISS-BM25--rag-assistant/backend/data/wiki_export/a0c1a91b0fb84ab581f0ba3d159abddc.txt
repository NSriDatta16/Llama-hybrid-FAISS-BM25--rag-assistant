Come In Spinner is an Australian novel by Dymphna Cusack and Florence James, originally published in 1951 and set in Sydney at the end of the Second World War.

Name
The title refers to a phrase used in the Australian gambling game of two-up. "Come in spinner" is the call given by the game manager when all bets are placed and the coins are ready to be tossed.

Plot
The book tells the story of three women, Claire, Guinea and Deb, who are co-workers in the beauty salon of an exclusive Sydney hotel. The story weaves together these characters with their familial and romantic relationships, as they struggle to manage the realities of working for the privileged upper classes, to whom no rules apply, while their own families cope with wartime deaths and losses, rationing, government manpower recruitment and stiflingly conservative attitudes surrounding the role and perception of the "acceptable" behaviour of women.

Publication
Cusack and James entered their manuscript in the Daily Telegraph'''s £1000 novel competition, whose closing date was October 1946. It was judged the winner and the prizemoney handed over, but no announcement was made, and The Telegraph reneged on its commitment to publish the novel, which covered such topics as abortion, adultery, prostitution and rape, as well as promiscuity and the black market. Heinemann published an expurgated version in 1951. The book was reworked from the original MS by Florence James, and was republished in 1987 for Richard Walsh of Angus and Robertson, partly due to the interest caused by the development of a television adaptation of the book. Cusack was not able to take part in this restoration or witness the renewed popularity of the novel as she died in 1981.

Radio adaptation
In 1954 the novel was adapted as a serial for radio. It was popular but controversial, and was axed by 3UZ Melbourne after two episodes due to viewer complaints.

Film and television

In the 1950s, film director Jack Lee expressed interest in making a movie out of the novel.

In 1989–90, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation made a television mini-series styled Come in Spinner, based on the novel, starring Lisa Harrow, Kerry Armstrong, Rebecca Gibney, Martin Vaughan and Sheila Kennelly. The series was well received by critics and audiences and was replayed on the Channel 10 network in 1991. It was released on DVD in 2005. One critic called it a "wonderfully sumptuous and faithful adaptation", praising Gibney and Harrow in particular.
The soundtrack album was released featuring Grace Knight and Vince Jones. It was produced by Martin Armiger with arrangements and conducting by Derek Williams and William Motzing. The album achieved platinum sales awards.
