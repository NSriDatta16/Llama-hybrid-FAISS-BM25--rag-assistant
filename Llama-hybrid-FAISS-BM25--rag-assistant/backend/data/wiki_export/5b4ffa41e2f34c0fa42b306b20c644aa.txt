Rhymes scored a second consecutive nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards.

Background
"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See" is the first song producer Buddah has ever produced. Fellow producer Shamello found American soft rock duo Seals and Crofts' 1976 recording "Sweet Green Fields", and the two came up with the instrumental of the song. After Fabulouz Fabz who was Rhymes' road manager at the time heard the beat, he showed it to Rhymes.

In a studio session with Puff Daddy, Q-Tip and Fat Joe and his crew, Rhymes played the beat for them and Puff Daddy and Q-Tip told him, "Yo, you need to stop screaming on records all the time. Bitches don't wanna do that shit all the time. [...] Just make a record just being cool, just use your regular voice." After finishing the song, Rhymes played it for them, "they was [...] losing they mind in a crazy way. [...] It was the most incredible reinvention to them and the fact that it was they idea..." After only hearing positive feedback, Rhymes stuck to his more calm delivery. He has stated that the song "was the last thing [he] expected to make."

Composition and lyrics
"Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See" was composed in  time and the key of C♯ minor, with a tempo of 99 beats per minute. It has a duration time of three minutes and twenty seconds.

The song and most notably the intro have Busta Rhymes and his road manager at the time Fabulouz Fabz ad-libbing in a similar way to Puff Daddy, who along with Q-Tip was the inspiration for Rhymes to rely on the texture of his voice rather than the energy his delivery was known for. In the first verse, Rhymes ends each line with a "yo" sound. He has stated that he did so because, "when we used to go out of town, the West Indian dudes to blend in and make themselves seem like they was American, these niggas would just add the word 'yo.'"

Music video
The official music video for the song, directed by Hype Williams and designed by Ron Norsworthy, is based on Eddie Murphy's 1988 film Coming to America. According to Busta Rhymes, the inspiration for this idea was the fact that Coming to America was playing on the television in the studio at the time he and the production crew were working on mixing the record.  The film is about an African living in New York City and Busta Rhymes felt that the record had an African sound to it.  At the chorus is a well choreographed dance routine which is followed by Busta running from an elephant and him, along with The Flipmode Squad, in glowing tribal African makeup and outfit. The video debuted in mid-August 1997 on MTV.  with Pauly Shore interviewing Rhymes live. The video received heavy rotation on both the MTV and BET networks. The video was filmed at Chambers and Centre Street in Downtown Manhattan — including the main lobby of the Surrogate's Courthouse.
