Katarzyna Rogowiec (born 14 October 1977) is a Polish Paralympian. She won two gold medals at the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Turin in cross-country skiing, and also competes at the highest levels in biathlon (current world champion).

Rogowiec hails from the Polish mountain folk (). She was born in Rabka-Zdrój, Poland. She is an economist by training, and lives in Kraków, while training in Nowy Sącz.

She won three silver medals at the 2003 World Championships, and was the world champion in biathlon in the 12.5 km Individual at the 2005 World Championships.

When she was three years old, she suffered a debilitating accident at harvest, when a harvesting machine cut off both of her hands. She says that she does not remember any of that, except for hearing it through her parents' tales. She grew up and learned to eat and drink without the use of hands.

In 2010, she established the Katarzyna Rogowiec Foundation avanti.

Katarzyna will not be appearing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.
