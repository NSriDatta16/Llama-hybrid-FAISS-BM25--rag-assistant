Filip Emiel Julien De Man (born 11 November 1955) is a Flemish politician and journalist. He has an M.A. in philosophy and lives in Vilvoorde, Flemish Brabant. He is the brother of actress Brigitte De Man and the son of Jos De Man, a well-known lawyer and writer.

Career in Vlaams Belang 
De Man was born in Roeselare. In 1991 he became a member of Parliament for Vlaams Belang (formerly the Vlaams Blok). Within his party he belongs to the outspoken right-wing group, with a strong focus on immigration. He was quoted saying that a Muslim cannot be a democrat. In the Chamber he strongly rejects naturalisations and amnesty for undocumented migrants. Regarding crime statistics, he advocates honest information to citizens. As a partisan of a tough approach on crime, he favours the actual serving of prison sentences, the death penalty for child murderers such as Dutroux and Aït Oud, the expelling of criminally convicted foreigners and the active tracking down of terrorist cells.

As for energy and climate, he states that nuclear power plants of the third and fourth generation in conjunction with the 'hydrogen economy' can be an answer to petrol blackmail by hostile regimes and to problems regarding energy supply - and would in no way be harmful regarding climate change (of which he doubts mankind is the prime reason responsible).

With regard to the problems between Flemings and Walloons, De Man is of the opinion that "Good governance = Flemish governance". He advocates the introduction of the concept of sub-nationality in Brussels, implying that inhabitants could freely opt for a Flemish social and fiscal regime. According to him, this would lead to a stronger position in the eventual negotiations on the breaking-up of Belgium ('Congress book Brussels', 1999). His views on Europe are confederate, with a strong emphasis on the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of a 'Fortress Europe' in order to counter mass immigration from the other side of the Mediterranean.
