Museum

The Mission Museum (Museu das Missões) is a history museum located in São Miguel Mission.

The creation of the museum was one of the first initiatives of the Office of Historical and Artistic Heritage, today IPHAN.   In 1937 the SPHAN was created and in the same year, the architect Lucio Costa was sent to Rio Grande do Sul to analyze the remains of the ruins of the Seven Peoples of the Missions, and propose measures. One of his proposals was to create a museum to house the statues missionaries  dispersed throughout the region. In 1938, the remnants of the town of San Miguel and the museum building were listed as National Heritage, and in 1940, the Museum of the Missions was officially established.

Between 1938 and 1940, the architect Lucas Mayerhofer directed the stabilization works in the mission Church of San Miguel, the construction of the museum building, and was in charge of gathering the works of statuary.

Currently listed in the museum's collection are religious images from the time of installation of the Jesuit missions in the region.
