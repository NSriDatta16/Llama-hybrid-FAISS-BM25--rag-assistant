He spent four years working as a ship's musician and had performed and recorded with a number of other musicians and bands, including Michael Jackson, Boy George, Derek Bailey and Mike Oldfield.

A native of Glasgow, Cooper moved to London in 1965 where he became a professional musician.

In 1972 and 1973, Cooper studied music with British double bassist and teacher Peter Ind. In 1978 he moved to Zürich, but returned to Scotland in 1990 where he ran a free improvisation workshop in Edinburgh.

Among the musicians with whom Cooper performed and recorded were Evan Parker, Keith Tippett, Kenny Wheeler, Ken Colyer, Bobby Bradford and Lol Coxhill. He also recorded with Strawbs, the Bill Wells Octet and a number of other jazz, rock and folk groups. His main musical influences included Thelonious Monk, King Oliver and Derek Bailey.
