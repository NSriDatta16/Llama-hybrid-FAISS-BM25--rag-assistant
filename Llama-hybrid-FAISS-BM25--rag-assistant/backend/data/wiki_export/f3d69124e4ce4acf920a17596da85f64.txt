The ARIA Singles Chart ranks the best-performing singles in Australia.

In 2006, 14 singles claimed the top spot, including Lee Harding's "Wasabi"/"Eye of the Tiger", which started its peak position in late 2005.

Five collaborations topped the chart. Thom's "I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)" was the longest-running number-one single of 2006, having topped the ARIA Singles Chart for ten consecutive weeks. Shakira's "Hips Don't Lie" topped the chart for nine consecutive weeks, Rihanna's "SOS" stayed at number-one for eight consecutive weeks, TV Rock's "Flaunt It" stayed at number-one for five weeks and Leith spent four weeks at number-one with "Night of My Life".
