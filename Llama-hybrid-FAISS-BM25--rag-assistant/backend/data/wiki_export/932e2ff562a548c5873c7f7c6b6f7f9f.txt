Al Jazira Club is an Emirati professional football club based in Abu Dhabi, that currently competes in the UAE Pro League.

History
Al-Jazira was established in 1974 as a merger between Khalidiyah and Al Bateen. The club struggled to stay in the league, getting relegated on multiple occasions during the 1980s and 1990s, but experienced a recent success when Sheikh Mansour invested into them in the 2000s. Since his purchase, they won their first league title in 2011 and two more league titles in 2017 and 2021. Al Jazira have produced talented homegrown players such as Ali Mabkhout and Khalfan Mubarak and many others that would end up playing for the UAE national team.
