Events

January–March
February 17 – The American Association and the National League, along with the Northwestern League, sign the Tripartite Agreement (also known as the National Agreement).  This agreement binds the leagues to respect each other's valid player contracts  as well as increasing the size of the reserve list from 6 to 11 players.  This leads to relative harmony among the leagues until the Players' League wars of 1889–1890.
March 14 – The Peoria Club of the Northwestern League makes a motion to ban blacks, a move directly aimed at Toledo's star catcher, Moses Fleetwood Walker.  After heated discussion, the motion is withdrawn and Walker remains eligible to play.
