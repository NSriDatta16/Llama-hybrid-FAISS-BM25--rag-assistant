History
Fresvik was an isolated valley community until 1976.  People could only access the village by boat on the Sognefjorden.  In 1976, a road from Feios to Fresvik was completed, marking the first time there was a road connection to the village.  Historically, Fresvik had been a part of Leikanger Municipality since the main part of Leikanger is located directly north (across the fjord).  After the road was completed to Fresvik from Feios and westward into Vik Municipality, discussions began about municipal borders since Fresvik now was more easily connected to Vik rather than a  boat ride across the huge Sognefjorden.  As of 1 January 1992, Fresvik and its surroundings (all of Leikanger that was south of the fjord and west of the Aurlandsfjorden) were transferred to Vik Municipality.

Name
The village (and parish) is named after the old Fresvik farm () since the Fresvik Church was built there. The first element is the genitive of the name of the god Freyr and the last element is vík which means "inlet" or "bay". Another, less common theory is that is originates from settlement/farmstead of Frisians. The name has similarties to the Scottish Highland hamlet Freswick and with the town of Vreeswijk in the Netherlands. The name Freswick could mean 'Frisians wic' The place name Vreeswijk stemms from the medieval name Fresionovvic (11th century) meaning settlement of Frisians.
