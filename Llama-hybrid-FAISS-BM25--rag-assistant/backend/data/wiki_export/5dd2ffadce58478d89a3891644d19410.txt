Midnight on the Water is a solo classical/bluegrass album by Mark O'Connor. In it are six of his original caprices and four improvisations, as well as his arrangements of some traditional folk works.

The caprices are loosely based on Paganini's 24 Caprices for Solo Violin. They are in much the same spirit of technical difficulty - Mark O'Connor's word was that "This album easily represents my best playing on a recording." They contain many references to Paganini's Caprices, and draw upon O'Connor's repertoire of classic Texas fiddle motifs. In this, they represent a sort of bluegrass/classical virtuoso crossover, and a dedication to Paganini.

Midnight on the Water, the first part of the album's Track 17 medley, is a tune that Mark O'Connor's Texas mentor, Benny Thomasson, attributed to his father and uncle. It is somewhat of a dedication to Thomasson.
