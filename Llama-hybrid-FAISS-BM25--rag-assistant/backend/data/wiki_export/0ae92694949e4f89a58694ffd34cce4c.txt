Career
Kinsella's first musical project was serving as drummer for the band Cap'n Jazz, which he co-founded with his brother Tim.

In 2001, Kinsella began his current solo project, Owen, in which he performs vocals, guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, loops, etc. Kinsella was also in a band called The Shirts and Skins, with his wife. In 2013, he released two EPs with his latest project, Their / They're / There, featuring Evan Weiss of Into It. Over It. and Matthew Frank of Loose Lips Sink Ships. He has also been part of the band The One Up Downstairs, alongside American Football drummer Steve Lamos.

Many of his albums, including Owen and No Good for No One Now, were recorded at his mother's home.
