Synopsis 
Seventeen-year-old Juana Perez (Daniela Alvarado) is a bright student with a college scholarship to study journalism in the United States. During a routine medical checkup, she becomes pregnant by artificial insemination due to a hospital error. The father of the baby is discovered to be Mauricio de la Vega (Ricardo Álamo), the owner of Positivo fashion magazine. Years before, Mauricio suffered from a chronic illness and after recovering, he had his semen stored in order to fulfill his dreams of having a child with his wife, Carlota Vivas (Roxana Díaz). After learning of the hospital error, Mauricio tries to find the girl who could possibly be carrying his child and his only hope of becoming a father.

When her pregnancy is discovered and causes a scandal, Juana leaves school and finds a job as a photographer at Positivo. She begins to get close to Mauricio while working there, and he begins to fall in love with her, especially after discovering she is the mother of his child. Carlota's inability to give Mauricio a child and the possibility that Juana will take him away from her leads her to do everything possible to keep Mauricio and Juana separated.

Mauricio's business partner, Francisco Rojas (Saul Marin), disappears during Positivo magazine's party, leaving his wife Desirée alone and penniless.

Rogelio Vivas, Carlota's father who owns shares in Positivo, is secretly planning to take over the business from Mauricio and frame him for the death of Francisco. He becomes attracted to Desirée and tries to get close to her, much to the dismay of his wife Amparo. Desirée, who is friends with Carlota, stays at her house, and becomes infatuated with Mauricio.
