The 6th Georgia Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It was organized at Macon, Georgia, in April 1861.

Future governor of Georgia, Alfred H. Colquitt, was elected its first colonel. The regiment fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Antietam and participated in Stonewall Jackson's flank attack at the Battle of Chancellorsville. The unit later saw action at battery Wagner near Charleston, South Carolina, and the Battle of Olustee near Ocean Pond, Florida.
The remnants and survivors of the regiment surrendered at Greenboro, North Carolina on April 26, 1865, to forces under the command of William T. Sherman.
