Minae of Silla (c. 817–839) (r. 838–839) was the 44th ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was a great-grandson of King Wonseong, and the son of Daeachan Kim Chung-gong.  His mother was a Kim, Lady Gwibo.  He married the daughter of Gakgan Kim Yeong-gong.

Being of true bone rank, Minae rose to the rank of sangdaedeung.  He then schemed with Kim Rihong and others to overthrow King Huigang.  They threatened the King and drove him to kill himself.  However, in the following year, Kim Ujing allied himself with Jang Bogo, who sent his forces into the capital (Gyeongju) to topple and slay the king.  Minae died at the soldiers' hands in the twelfth lunar month, early in 839.
