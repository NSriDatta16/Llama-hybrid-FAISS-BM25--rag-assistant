Lee began acting in 1987, when she was 12 years old. Ten years later, Lee got her breakout role when she landed the role of Cassie Chan, the Pink Ranger for Power Rangers Turbo, a role she would continue to play in Power Rangers in Space. In 1999, she voiced Meifa Puzi in Cowboy Bebop. In 2001, Lee was cast the lead female role in the Golden Harvest action adventure Extreme Challenge.

She portrayed Haruhi Suzumiya in the first series of live-action promotional videos launched by Bandai Entertainment on December 22, 2006, to announce the R1 license of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Here, she is credited as Patricia Lee, although she referred to herself as Patricia Ja Lee in the first videos. Before the animated series' English cast was announced, it was speculated that she might be the voice of Haruhi as well. In July 2007, Patricia appeared at Anime Expo during the SOS Brigade concert. She was replaced for the second series of promotional videos by Cristina Vee. Lee appeared in the Haruhi anime as the voice of Mizuki Okajima, the drummer of the all-girl student band ENOZ.
