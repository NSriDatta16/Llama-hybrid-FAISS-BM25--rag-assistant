Old Hickory is an unincorporated neighborhood of metropolitan Nashville, located in the Hadley Bend section of eastern Davidson County, Tennessee. Old Hickory is governed by the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County, due to the fact that the government of Davidson County is consolidated with that of Nashville.

Etymology
Old Hickory is named in honor of President Andrew Jackson, nicknamed "Old Hickory".

History
Old Hickory is probably best known for being a former company town as the site of a large DuPont plant. Many of the houses were built to house DuPont employees and supervisors in the early days of the factory's existence. Many historic homes are located in the area known as the Village of Old Hickory, containing a number that are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The smaller bungalow houses were built by DuPont as residences for factory workers, with the larger homes being designated for management. Many of the formerly dilapidated houses are being renovated and gentrified.
