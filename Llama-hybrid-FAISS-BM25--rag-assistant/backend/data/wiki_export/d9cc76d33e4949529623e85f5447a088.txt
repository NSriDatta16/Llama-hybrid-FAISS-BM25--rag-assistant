The song is about Twista meeting a woman on the street and telling her about all the things he could do for her, while pointing out her looks. He tells the woman he can make her a celebrity overnight.  The song "Prototype" from Outkast is referenced in the song when Twista says "Dre told me you were the prototype". The music video was directed by Erik White and features Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari (who played the strings in the record), models Miya Granatella and Esther Baxter, Bishop Don "Magic" Juan and Chicago rappers Do or Die, Da Brat, Rip, White Boy, Crucial Conflict, and Bump J. While he raps the song's hook, Kanye West did not appear in the video.
