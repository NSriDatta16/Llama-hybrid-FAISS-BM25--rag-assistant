PlanetHood: The Key to Your Survival and Prosperity (2nd Ed.: PlanetHood: The Key to Your Future) was written by Benjamin B. Ferencz and Ken Keyes, Jr. in 1988.  This non-copyrighted work was written to advance the argument for a system of international law complete with courts, enforcement, and an international congress.

Book 
The authors start by highlighting some of the serious global problems facing humanity. They then proceed to show that a system of effective international law has been a developing trend historically, beginning with Franciscus de Victoria in 1526 through the establishment of a federalist government in the wake of the American Revolution and continuing to the present day.

Optimism is the central tone of the book and it was designed to inspire its readers into replacing what they call the "law of force" with the "force of law."
