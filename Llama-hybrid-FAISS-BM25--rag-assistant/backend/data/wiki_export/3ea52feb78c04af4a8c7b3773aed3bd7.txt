Methodist Church
Yarnscombe Methodist Church was built in 1908 replacing a wood building built in 1861. The original building was a Bible Christian chapel described by the North Devon Journal as "a wooded structure, built upon six wheels, the object of which is to prevent its becoming the property of the owner of the soil on the expiration of the lease on which it is granted to the present lessee." Shortly after the foundation stones for the new church were laid, the Bible Christian Church in England merged with other Methodist denominations to form the United Methodist Church. The Yarnscombe United Methodist Church closed in 1993, and the building was converted to a private residence.
