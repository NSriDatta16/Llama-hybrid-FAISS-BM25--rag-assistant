They established an independent label named Ghost Records in 2002. Hidekazu Hinata joined the band as bassist in 2003, giving the band a heavier sound. In October of the same year they released a single, "Traveling Gargoyle" from Toshiba EMI.

The band toured all over Japan during their Linear tour in 2007, as well as performing a joint tour in December 2013 with Asian Kung-Fu Generation to celebrate both bands' 10-year anniversaries.
