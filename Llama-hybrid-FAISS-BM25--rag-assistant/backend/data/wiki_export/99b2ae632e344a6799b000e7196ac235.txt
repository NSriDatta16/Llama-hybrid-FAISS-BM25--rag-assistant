History 

The Battle on the Elster, the third and last battle between the Salian king Henry IV of Germany and anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden, was fought on October 14, 1080 near Hohenmölsen on the White Elster river. In the year of 1091 the burgward "Melsin villa" (Milzin) was first mentioned in a document. In 1284 the city got market rights. There were two major fires in 1558 and 1578, which almost completely destroyed the city and in the Thirty Years´ War the whole city except one house was destroyed.

In the 19th century brown coal was found in Hohenmölsen, which helped the city to gain prosperity. Furthermore it helped the city at getting electric lights in 1912. With the founding of the GDR, the mining in the area of Hohenmölsen reached a new dimension. Neighboring cities, such as Mutschau, Köttichau, Döbris, Queisau, Steingrimma and Dobergast were devastated and the residents were resettled to the new districts "Hohenmölsen-Süd" and "Hohenmölsen-Nord", which has the increase of the population from the 1950s as a consequence. To this day brown coal is being mined near the city in the Braunkohletagebau Profen.
