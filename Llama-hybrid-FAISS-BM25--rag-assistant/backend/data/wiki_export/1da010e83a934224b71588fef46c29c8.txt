Tarzan is a series that aired on NBC from 1966 to 1968. The series portrayed Tarzan (played by Ron Ely) as a well-educated character who had grown tired of civilization, and returned to the jungle where he had been raised.  The first five episodes (1-4 and 7 in transmission order) were filmed in Brazil; the production then relocated to Mexico. The series was set in a fictional newly independent African nation.

This series retained many of the trappings of the film series, included the "Tarzan yell" and Cheeta, but excluded Jane as part of the "new look" for the fabled apeman that executive producer Sy Weintraub had introduced in previous motion pictures starring Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, and Mike Henry.  CBS aired repeat episodes of the program during the summer of 1969.
