Sucre à la crème is a confectionery popular in and originating from French Canada. It is made from cream, sugar and brown sugar that is mixed together, cooked, cooled and then kneaded. Depending on the fineness of the crystals obtained, it can be granular or very soft. The texture is firm enough to cut and hold. Sucre à la crème is usually served as small cubes.

Other ingredients are sometimes added, like butter, maple syrup, walnuts, pecans, vanilla, or chocolate.

This delicacy is especially popular during the Holiday season. But, it is also a common sight in grocery stores and convenience stores.

It bears many similarities to Scottish tablets and American fudge.
