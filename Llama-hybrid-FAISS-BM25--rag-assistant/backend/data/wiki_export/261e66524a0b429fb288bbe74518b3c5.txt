The Pandyas were fierce warriors who took part in the Kurukshetra War as per the epic Mahabharata. A Pandya king named Darshak, is mentioned as participating in the Kurukshetra War, siding with the Pandavas.

They probably share the same origin with the Pandyan dynasty who were the main patrons in the early Sangam era.
