A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol is an isometric shoot 'em up developed by Japanese studio Opus and published by SETA for the SNES.

Gameplay 

For the gameplay, it's similar to Strike. The game is based somewhat upon the Gulf War. As a pilot in the Air Strike Patrol, the player's aim is to stop Zarak (Iraq) from invading Sweit (Kuwait). The player gains points for judgement in managing resources, attack power and political sensitivity. The total of these determines which text is displayed when the game is finished. The dogfights make the game more diverse and the cheat options, e.g. ability to destroy buildings with the chain gun, give variety. There are various optional targets to destroy on the open map, but if you take too long, you fail the mission.
