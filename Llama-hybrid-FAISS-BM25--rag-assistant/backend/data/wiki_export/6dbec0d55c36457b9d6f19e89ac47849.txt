The third World Cup season began in December 1968 and concluded in March 1969.  This was the first season in which the races began prior to January 1, and that change immediately became permanent.  Karl Schranz of Austria won the first of two consecutive overall titles. Gertrude Gabl of Austria won the women's overall title.  For the first and only (as of 2016) time in World Cup history, a discipline trophy was shared by more than two people, as four men (three French, one Austrian) tied for the men's slalom trophy.

The race footage for the film Downhill Racer was shot during this season, primarily in January 1969.
