On Wednesday 24 July 2013, Leo Cushley, a priest of the diocese of Motherwell, was appointed the Archbishop of St Andrew's & Edinburgh. Cushley was ordained in 1985 by Devine in St John the Baptist Church, Uddingston before serving in the cathedral, St Serf's, Airdrie & St Aidan's, Wishaw. Since 1992 he has been a diplomat for the Vatican and held the post as head of the English-language section of the Vatican's Secretariat of State.

Maurice Taylor, a priest of the diocese was the Bishop of Galloway and served as Scotland's representative on the board of International Commission on English in the Liturgy. He was also its chairman from 1997 until 2002.

Another priest of the diocese, William Nolan, is the current Archbishop of Glasgow and former bishop of the Diocese of Galloway. Both Bishop Nolan and Bishop Taylor are former parish priests of Our Lady of Lourdes, East Kilbride who later became Bishop of Galloway.

Cardinal Thomas Winning, a priest of the diocese born in Wishaw, was Archbishop of Glasgow from 1974 until his death in 2001.

In 2016 Fr. John Farrell, retired priest of the Diocese of Motherwell, the last Head teacher at St Ninian's Falkland, Fife, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. His colleague Paul Kelly, a retired teacher from Portsmouth, was given ten years, both were convicted of the physical and sexual abuse of boys between the years 1979 and 1983. More than 100 charges involving 35 boys were made. Farrell and Kelly were members of the Irish Christian Brothers when the crimes were committed at the school which closed in 1983. According to The Times, it is believed this was the largest historical abuse case ever tried in Scotland, It was reported at the time of Farrell's trial that when he was released from prison steps would be taken to remove, laicise or defrock John Farrell however at this moment in time it can be neither confirmed or denied whether this has happened or not however, the Diocese of Motherwell website has his name listed as a retired Priest of the Diocese and he has not been laicised, defrocked or removed as promised after he was convicted. Under GDPR Data Protection rules it is difficult to ascertain the current situation with Farrell. The Diocese will only go as far as saying "Fr Farrell is very ill at this time" thus indicating he was not laicised by the Church.

Parishes and deaneries
The 75 parishes in the diocese are divided into six deaneries. Where after the title of a church two dates are given, the first is the date of the foundation of the parish and the second is the date of the opening of the current church building. Due to a shortage of priests, a number of parishes have begun to share parish priests, forming pairs of linked parishes.
