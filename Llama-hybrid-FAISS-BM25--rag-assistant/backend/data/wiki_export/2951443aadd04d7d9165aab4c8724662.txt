History
The original settlement in the area was called Trappe Springs and was founded in the 1850s by a small group of families. The current town was settled in the 1880s, half a mile west of the original site, and named Garner after a local gin operator. For most of the 20th century, the town has  experienced steady growth, from approximately 40 residents in 1914 to 98 in 1990. A post office was located in Garner from around 1890 to 1970.

The town has a Baptist church, an elementary/middle school, and several small businesses.
Much of the surrounding land is used for livestock farming.

The post office and general store in Garner were run for many years by a Mr. James A. Vance. A story about him is in a book by Ben K. Green, Wild Cow Tales. The story is called "The One That Got Away". Mr. Vance was born June 14, 1871, arrived in Garner on October 7, 1894, and died at home in Garner in 1964.

Two residents of the town are credited with invention of the regional domino game "42" in 1887.
