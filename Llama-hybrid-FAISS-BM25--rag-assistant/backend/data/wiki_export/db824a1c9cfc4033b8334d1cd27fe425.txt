History

Beginnings
According to some local historians, the stadium General Francisco Morazán was built little by little since 1938. Benedicto Muñoz one of the administrators of the stadium  in 2013, said to a sport news channel from San Pedro Sula. That it was around that time (1938), when teams of the neighborhood and surrounding communities began to carry  out their sporting events, right where the stadium is now located.

According to Muñoz, the Morazán was then a "Municipal Sports Park."  While other locals support Muñoz's claim, and have repeatedly said, that this was initially a park with basketball, baseball, tennis and football courts. And that the people who played at this Park, were the same people who petitioned to the municipality of San Pedro Sula  for the construction of a stadium. Later, and with the help of some sponsors, the construction of the stadium began.

In regards to the name of the stadium (Francisco Morazán) is because this facility is located near the Boulevard Morazán. According to some inhabitants of the city; from the year of 1940, patriotic parades of the city of San Pedro Sula began in Central Park and always ended in the Morazán Boulevard where the colleges and schools, such as the José Trinidad Reyes and the José Cecilio del Valle among many others, crowned the statue of the General Francisco Morazán. Since then, the stadium began to be known as 'Estadio Francisco Morazán'.

Destruction and burning of the stadium 

On March 17, 1974, was scheduled the national clasico between CD Olimpia and CD Marathon, valid for the National League Championship. Due to an overbooking of tickets and free passes "The Morazán Stadium" hosted more fans than its capacity. This situation, created a total chaos within the facilities.

To better allocate these fans, the stadium authorities had to place them on the sidelines. When the referees became aware of this situation, they thought it was too risky for the players as well as for the fans, that's why, they decided to cancel the game. The game's suspension resulted in acts of vandalism and violence by infuriated fans. This in turn, ended up with dozens of people injured as well as the destruction and burning of the entire Morazán Stadium.

The next day, some of the Honduran newspapers entitled on their covers "We were left without Stadium!", "with luxury of vandalism and looting" (a day of mourning in the national sport.) While newspaper La Prensa of San Pedro Sula entitled; "Fans destroyed the Morazán Stadium."
