Danielle "Dani" Evans (born June 4, 1985 in Little Rock, Arkansas) is an American model, crowned the winner of Cycle 6 of America's Next Top Model in the spring of 2006. She currently resides in New York City, where she founded Monrowe, a unisex line of ready-to-wear hats.

America's Next Top Model

Winning America's Next Top Model Cycle 6 
Evans was the ninth finalist selected (just before Kathy Hoxit, Furonda Brasfield, Gina Choe and Wendy Wiltz filled the final four places) for the top thirteen to compete on the UPN reality television show America's Next Top Model Cycle 6. She never placed below sixth and was thought by the judges to be one of the front-runners in the competition, noted for her striking face. Over her stay, Evans was voted Covergirl of the Week twice, received one first call-out and would have won the Go-See challenge had the final four been on time. It was not until the second half of the contest that she came under criticism for her heavy southern accent, which the judges felt was problematic, as the competition winner would shoot commercials for Covergirl; however, they acknowledged that she could work with a speech coach to eradicate her accent. Evans had two consecutive bottom two appearances in Bangkok where she survived both over Sara Albert and Jade Cole. In the finale, the judges were torn, with some of the judges preferring fellow finalist Joanie Dodds's versatile portfolio, while others (notably judge Nigel Barker) preferring Evans's "signature look." However, they felt Evans had the stronger in-person presence and commanded the final catwalk as well as having a stunning portfolio. Evans's charisma and charm edged out Dodds, thus crowning her the sixth winner of America's Next Top Model.

America's Next Top Model Cycle 7 
Evans appeared in the final episode of Cycle 7 to assist the final three models (Eugena Washington, CariDee English and Melrose Bickerstaff) with their CoverGirl Outlast Double Lip Shine commercial and photoshoot.

After Washington was eliminated, the remaining two contestants English and Bickerstaff participated in the final runway playing ghostly brides in wedding gowns designed by Victorio & Lucchino with Evans opening the show.

America's Next Top Model Cycle 9 
Evans appeared in a Cycle 9 episode posing in an Akademiks photoshoot for Seventeen magazine with challenge winner Lisa Jackson along with fellow contestants chosen to participate, Janet Mills and Ebony Morgan.
