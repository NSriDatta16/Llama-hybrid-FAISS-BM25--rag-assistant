History

Already in the year 124 AD, there was a Roman bridge over the Thur in Weinfelden. The name Weinfelden appears the first time in a document from 838.

Weinfelden was by far the biggest town in the canton of Thurgau. In 1798, Paul Reinhart and his committee led the area to freedom from the domination of the Eidgenossen. In 1803, Thurgau became an independent canton, through the mediation of Napoleon, with Frauenfeld as capital.

In 1830, Thomas Bornhauser spoke to a large crowd in Weinfelden, demanding a liberal constitution for the canton. It is one of the first (if not the first) such document.

Portraits of both Paul Reinhart and Thomas Bornhauser hang in the Rathaus.

Since it lies in the middle of the canton, part of the cantonal administration is located in the town, as is the Thurgau cantonal bank.  The grand council of the canton meets in Weinfelden during the winter.
