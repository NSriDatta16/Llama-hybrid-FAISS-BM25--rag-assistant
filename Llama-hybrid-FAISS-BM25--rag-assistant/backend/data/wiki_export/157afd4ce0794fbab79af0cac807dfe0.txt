Imre Hajdú (; 26 January 1911 – 21 October 1989) better known by his stage name Jean Image () was a Hungarian-French director, script writer and producer of French animation films.

His stage name, "Image" is based upon the French pronunciation of "Im-Haj", the first syllables of his name.

In 1959, he participated in the creation of Annecy International Animated Film Festival.

Jean Image was also the author of a book on animation titled Le Dessin animé : initiation à la technique (lit. Animation film: A technical introduction) (1979).

Career
He emigrated to France in 1932 where he worked on films and eventually produced several shorts on his own. After the war, influenced by the classic style of Walt Disney's films, he became the first French producer of the full-length animated film (Johnny the Giant Killer). In 1948, he founded the Films Jean Image company and in 1960 he devoted himself to producing television cartoon series. Two of these series (Kiri le Clown and Joe), have become very popular.

Personal life 
His first wife was Eraine Image (born Germaine Suzanne Charvot). He was later married to France Image, with whom he co-wrote his later movies and series.
