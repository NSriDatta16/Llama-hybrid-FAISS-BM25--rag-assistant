Saidu Sharif Airport  is an airport in Pakistan. It is situated near the Swat River and between the villages of Dherai and Kanju in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

The airport was built in 1978, and two daily flights were available to Peshawar and Islamabad before the airport was shut down during the First Battle of Swat in 2007. There were hopes of reopening the airport in 2012. However, this reopening was repeatedly delayed due to the security situation. Nevertheless, after a hiatus of 17 years, the flight operation at the airport resumed in March 2021.

Many visitors that come to the valley of Swat and to the Malam Jabba ski resort in summers fly to Swat through this airport.
