History
The region which was known as al-Quṣayr, was part of the Principality of Antioch during the Crusader era. In 1180, patriarch Aimery of Limoges fled to the region, after he had excommunicated Bohemond III in Antioch. The latter besieged the region, but nobleman Rainald II Masoir supported the patriarch, until King Baldwin IV sent a delegation to settle the dispute.

Altınözü was heavily damaged by powerful earthquakes in February 2023 and subsequent aftershocks.

Geography
Altınözü stands on the fertile Kuseyr plateau, and several crops such as olives (the largest olive growing area is in this part of Turkey), tobacco, grains and other crops are grown here. The district gets its water from the Yarseli reservoir.
