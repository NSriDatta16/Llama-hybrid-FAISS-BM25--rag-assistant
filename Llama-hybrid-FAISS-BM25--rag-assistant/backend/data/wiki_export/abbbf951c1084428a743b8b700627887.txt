History
American Football has been played in New Zealand in an organised form since 1982. Early scrimmages reportedly taking place as far back as 1971 at Kelston Boys High school and run by "The Godfather" of NZ football, George O'Scanlon. The first reported game was in 1975 between a team in Auckland known as the ADC Cowboys who travelled to Hamilton for a one-off game against a team from Church College.
 
The scrimmages in Auckland continued and would go on to see the formation of the Metro Lions and Henderson Rangers clubs. There were 4 original clubs formed in 1982, based in Auckland; South Auckland Saints, Metro Lions, Henderson Rangers and North Shore. 2 of those clubs remain today, the Saints as South Auckland Raiders and the Mountain Lions as Metro Lions. Much later competition was started in Wellington and other clubs were formed in places like Whangarei, Tauranga, Hamilton, Wanganui, Palmerston North and Levin.

The game today sees the continued growth of the game in Canterbury, Hawkes Bay and Nelson.

1940's exhibition football was played in wartime New Zealand, with games put on by US serviceman during WW2. Reported games were played in both Auckland and Wellington between rival US warships.

1949 sees the first reported NZ football player to make a US college team. Joe Hapi from the Hawkes Bay area appears on the BYU Cougars football team as an offensive lineman.

1964 saw exhibition football played in Gisborne as elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints put on a game complete with full equipment for the locals. Kaiti Trojans played the Te Hapara Packers.

Once again in the late '70s, elders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints introduced football to the Polynesian communities in Auckland and Hamilton, which would lead to the early scrimmages and the competition in Auckland as we know it today.

1983 saw the San Francisco 49ers draft high-profile USC linebacker Riki Ellison. Riki's presence in the NFL would help promote the game to NZers and prove that Kiwis could make it in professional American Football.

During the late 80's NZ Football received unprecedented media coverage when TV3 began to broadcast NFL highlights packages and Sky Sports would televise the Super Bowl live. The then NZGFA sports information director Ed Mason's work, especially in the newspaper print media was essential to spreading the word that American Football had now well and truly arrived in NZ. Ed Mason went on to become a founding member of NZ Baseball and was inducted into the NZ Baseball Hall Of Fame. Ed Mason is also a Life Member of the Metro Lions American Football Club.

There have been a succession of governing bodies for the sport with the current NZAFF being recognised by the NZ Government and with membership from all of the regions playing football; Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. Twice in its history, there have been organisational splits with competing leagues being formed. In the late 1980s there was the NZ Gridiron Football Association and the NZ American Football League, in the late 1990s and early 2000s there was Gridiron New Zealand and the NZ American Football Association. On both of these occasions, the leagues rejoined each other and overcame their differences.

1989 saw former NZAFL founder George O'Scanlon establish the ISSI for athletes in Australia, which would go on to introduce the Down Under Bowl concept in the Southern Hemisphere. A tournament NZ would eventually send teams to Australia to compete in. Down Under Bowl directors George O'Scanlon and former Utah State University head coach and BYU special teams coach Chris Pella were instrumental in bringing numerous football programs to NZ in the 1980s and creating countless pathways for NZ football players who wanted pursue the game further in the US.

Gridiron NZ saw the introduction and much-needed promotion of age grades to American Football in NZ, a component essential to its continued growth over the years.

The Canadian Football League has also seen a number of athletes with NZ roots make an appearance on rosters over the years. Luc Mullinder, Will Hinchcliff and Johan Asiata.

Likewise, there has also been a number of athletes appearing on NFL rosters in last few years with NZ roots including Stephen Paea (Bears, Redskins, Browns), Tevita Finau (Jets, Texans), Kona Schwenke (Seahawks), Rhett Ellison (Vikings) BYU rugby convert Paul Lasike (Cardinals, Bears). Others to try out for NFL spots over the years include Will Hinchcliff (Redskins), Nic Purcell (Eagles), Joe Tuineau (Jets), Johan Asiata (Bears) and Abe Markowitz (Seahawks), Andrew Motu'apuaka (Jacksonville Jaguars) 

American Football Auckland Club Profiles

Metro Lions:
 Originally known as the Mountain Lions. A foundation club that ran out of Potters Park in Mount Eden. Founding and life members included Pose Tafa, Willie-John Stowers and the late Peter Tua'i. To their credit they continue to this day and are one of the most successful clubs in the country. They are the Metro Lions and were one of the first club to supply players to US College football and the NFL. Most notable was Mark Nua who received a full football scholarship to play at the University of Hawaii. Mark Nua was drafted in the NFL by the Detroit Lions before eventually landing on the San Diego Chargers roster. Mark also played in the World League of American Football for the Sacramento Surge. Also attending the University of Hawaii was sprinter and part-time actor John Freeman. Another of the pioneer Metro Lions to attend college was Toa Sagapolu who played for the University of California Berkeley, playing in the famous Citrus Bowl in 1992 in Orlando. Former Toa Samoa and NZ Warriors rugby league player Shannon Stowers also attended Utah State University.

They also provided players to the US College system. Former Manu Samoa and Auckland rugby star Timo Tagaloa was the first NZ athlete to receive a full football scholarship to Utah State University.

Star players included Joe Fepuleai, David Woods and Nick Leger, both of whom would go on to play for the Roskill Rams and Mt Albert Mustangs. While lacking in size, they did the basics well, especially the sweep with their quick backs. The club lasted for only a few years before folding and several players joining other established teams. Colours: Red with yellow numbers and white pants.

Roskill Rams:

Frustrated at how the sport of American Football was being run, this new league focused on promoting juniors football along with improving the fundamental football skills and overall general level of play.
As a result, the early years of the Tamaki Lightning were highlighted by the number of teams available to the community.  Not only did they have the Premier (seniors) Team that still plays today, there was also U13, U15, U17, U19, 8-a-side, and Women's teams playing in competitions.  To provide a top level of coaching to all of these teams, the first 10 years of the Lightning also featured a number of international imports from around the world – The United States, Canada, Italy, Switzerland and Austria to name a few. Andy Nordine who toured NZ with the visiting Doane College Tigers amongst others.

Founded by GNZ pioneer Wayne Wright. Former coach Joe Ashfield is currently an assistant coach with Stanford University. Since the merger of the 2 leagues, the club remains without a Seniors team, but its Juniors team remains very competitive. The club continues with the promise of senior teams to expand into the future.

Waitakere Typhoon:
Another West Auckland club concentrating on juniors grade.
