Huff (born September 9, 1953) is an American businessman and politician who was the California State Senate minority leader and Senate Republican leader from January 5, 2012, until August 27, 2015. He represented the Senate's 29th District, which includes portions of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino counties.

Early life
Born on September 9, 1953, in Calexico, California, Huff grew up on his family's farm near El Centro. He has a bachelor's degree in psychology from Westmont College, and his business background is in grain handling and commodity wholesaling.

Political career

Diamond Bar 
Huff served on the Diamond Bar City Council, and was Mayor of the city in 1997 and 2001. He was also involved in local transportation issues, serving on the Four Corners Transportation Policy Group, Foothill Transit, and the Alameda Corridor East Construction Authority.

State Assembly 
Huff was elected to the California State Assembly in 2004, defeating Gail Pacheco, the wife of term-limited Bob Pacheco. The election was considered an upset. Reelected in 2006, he was a member of the California State Assembly until 2008.

State Senate 
Huff was elected to the California State Senate for the 29th district in 2008, succeeding the term-limited Bob Margett. In 2012, he was elected by the Republican Caucus to succeed the term-limited Bob Dutton as Senate Republican Leader. After the 2012 California State Senate elections, Huff was re-elected Senate Republican Leader. Term limits prevented him from running for re-election in 2016.

Huff was a member of the Senate Education Committee and authored legislation affecting K-12 education. He is an advocate of charter schools, school choice, and standardized testing. He supported SB 161, which allows trained volunteers to administer emergency medication to students with epilepsy who suffer a seizure at school. Huff introduced Senate Bill 1295, a measure to approve the placement of commercial advertisements on the exterior of school-buses. This bill was rejected by the Senate Education Committee but was given an option to be re-introduced at a later time. He introduced Senate Bill 1116 with Leland Yee (D-San Francisco), which defined and regulated "heritage schools", private after-school programs that teach foreign language and culture and required them to register with the California Department of Education instead of being licensed as child day care centers by the California Department of Social Services (DSS) Huff opposed a plan that would have replaced the current testing system with new tests based on the Common Core learning goals. Because test scores would be unavailable during the new test's two-year trial period, the U.S. Department of Education threatened to impose financial penalties on the state. The alternative supported by Huff was to require the use of both the old and the new test during that period. The state Senate approved the bill.

Huff cast a deciding vote in 2009 on a Senate rule waiver that allowed a measure on environmental exemptions favorable to one of Huff's donors, Majestic Realty. This vote led to criticism, as Majestic was also a client of his wife's consulting business. In 2011, Huff opposed Governor Jerry Brownâ€™s plan to abolish California's redevelopment agencies.

In a state government that as of 2012 is controlled by Democrats with super majorities in both houses, Huff has a reputation as a moderate Republican. The Los Angeles Times opined that "Senate Republican leader Bob Huff of Diamond Bar was more pragmatic, given his party's weakened political position in Sacramento. Brown 'is the most conservative of the three leading Democrats in Sacramento,' Huff said." Huff has worked with Brown on issues such as California's prison crisis.

Committee memberships
Huff served on the Senate Education Committee and was the Vice Chair of the Senate Budget Committee. He also served as a member of the Joint Committee on Senate Rules, the Select Committees of Asian Pacific Islander Affairs, California Job Creation and Retention, California's Horse Racing Industry, Earthquake and Disaster Preparedness, Response and Recovery and High-Speed Rail committees.

Huff's sub-committee assignments included: Education: Sustainable School Facilities and Education: Policy Research.
