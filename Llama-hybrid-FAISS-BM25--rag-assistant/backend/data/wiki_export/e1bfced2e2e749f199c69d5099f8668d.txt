The Kelowna Wings were a junior ice hockey team based in Kelowna, British Columbia that played in the Western Hockey League from 1982–85. The Wings were abysmal in their three-year tenure, winning just 56 out of 216 games played. The franchise relocated to Spokane, Washington following the 1984–85 season and became the Spokane Chiefs.

The City of Kelowna would wait ten years for the WHL to return as the Tacoma Rockets relocated to the city and became a perennial contender.
