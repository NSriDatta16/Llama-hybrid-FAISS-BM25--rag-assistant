Songs from the Recently Deceased is the third full-length release by American punk band the Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. It was originally released on Uncle God Damn Records in 1999, and was later re-released on Century Media Records in collaboration with People Like You Records in 2000 as a Digi-Pack. It is also featured in the 2006 box set "Little Box of Horrors".

This album was recorded in two separate sessions. In the first session, the band recorded the basic guitar, bass, drums and vocals for the album. Three to four months later, the band returned to the studio, and put the finishing touches on all the songs. A few of the songs had different titles during the first session and the second, such as "I Was a Teenage Ghoulscout", which was originally named "Rat Race", and "Plan 9 from Outa Space", which was originally named "Get Outta My Face".
