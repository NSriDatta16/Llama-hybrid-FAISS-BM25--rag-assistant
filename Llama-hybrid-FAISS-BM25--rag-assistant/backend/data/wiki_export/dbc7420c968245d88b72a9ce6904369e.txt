The Carolina Monarchs were a short-lived ice hockey team in the American Hockey League.  They played in Greensboro, North Carolina, at the Greensboro Coliseum, succeeding the ECHL Greensboro Monarchs, some of whose owners accepted an expansion proposal from the AHL to start play in the 1995-96 season.

Just two seasons later, though, the Hartford Whalers of the NHL announced that they would play in the Greensboro Coliseum for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons as the newly named Carolina Hurricanes, awaiting their permanent home arena's construction in Raleigh. The NHL team purchased the dethroned Monarchs, moving the franchise to New Haven, Connecticut, where the team played as the Beast of New Haven.
