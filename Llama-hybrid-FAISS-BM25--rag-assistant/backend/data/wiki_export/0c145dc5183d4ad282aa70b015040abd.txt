The concept of peasant mentality constitutes a widespread traditional characterisation of peasantry, often a disparaging one.

Peasants as a class predominated numerically in most agricultural societies from the time when the  Neolithic agricultural revolution took hold until the early modern period. But rulers, movers and shakers tended to come from different social classes, and historiography and social analysis became the preserve of a largely non-peasant social intelligentsia. "Official" attitudes to peasants sometimes scorn them and dismiss their importance as the basis of pre-modern civilisations. Hence the clich√© of "the peasant mentality, with its inherent conservatism and apathy towards change".

Richard Stites paints a brighter picture of (for example) Russian peasantry pre-1917:

Traces may intrude here of the idealised alternative view of peasant life, fostered by art and literature as a contrast to urban corruption. The  romantic pastoral image of peasant existence, dating from at least Hesiod and continuing through Virgil and Rousseau to the concept of the sturdy yeoman, would have peasant mentality as simple, yet genuine, emotional and loving, and idealised as bucolic.
