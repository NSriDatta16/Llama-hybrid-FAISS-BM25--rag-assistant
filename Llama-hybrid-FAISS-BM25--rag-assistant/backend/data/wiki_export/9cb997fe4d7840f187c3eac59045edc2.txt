Coleman attended the Chicago Wolves training camp for the 2008–09 season, before he was released. After starting the year in the ECHL with the Phoenix RoadRunners, Coleman was recalled to the Worcester Sharks but upon his return was traded to the Trenton Devils on November 21, 2008.

Coleman was then invited to the New Jersey Devils training camp for the 2009–10 before he was reassigned to AHL affiliate, the Lowell Devils. Coleman appeared in just three games with Lowell before he returned to Trenton for the season.

After attending the St. Louis Blues training camp, Coleman played the 2010–11 season with the Alaska Aces, posting a 2.19 GAA and a save percentage of .913, earning a record of 30-15-1-0 with 4 shutouts. In the Kelly Cup Playoffs, Coleman, along with the rest of the Aces set a playoff record with a 12-1 record to capture the cup.
