Jon Samuel Lewis is an American fiction writer under the pen name J. S. Lewis. He is co-author of the popular Grey Griffins series, originally published by Scholastic, Inc. The next three books in the Grey Griffins series will be published as the Grey Griffins Clockwork Chronicles by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers.  The original trilogy has sold over 850,000 copies to date.

Background 

Lewis grew up in the Midwestern United States, spending most of his time in Minnesota and Iowa before moving to Arizona where he attended Arizona State University, earning a degree in Broadcast Journalism.

At an early age, Lewis set out to become a comic book illustrator, but he discovered a love for writing when he first began crafting the background stories for the comic book characters he had drawn.

Lewis began his first novel at the age of fourteen with writing partner Derek Benz. Intended to be an epic fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien, Lewis and Benz never finished the manuscript.

The authors reunited in Arizona in 2000, however, where they began writing their Grey Griffins series.
