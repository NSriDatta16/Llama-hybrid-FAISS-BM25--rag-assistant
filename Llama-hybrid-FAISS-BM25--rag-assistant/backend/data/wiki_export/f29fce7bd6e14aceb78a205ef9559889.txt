The Ferrari Mythos is a mid-engine, rear wheel drive concept car based on the mechanical underpinnings of the Ferrari Testarossa. Designed by Italian design house Pininfarina and developed by automobile manufacturer Ferrari, its world premiere was at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show.

Design

The design was implemented on the platform of the Ferrari Testarossa, which dictated the car's wedge shape and large air intake ahead of the rear wheels. The design of the Mythos later evolved into the Ferrari F40's successor, the F50.

The show car is stored at the Pininfarina style center at Cambiano (Italy).

Acceleration figures of the car remain unknown but the car has a projected top speed of around .
