Many universities offer programs of study which tag academic degrees with a particular speciality. A tagged degree incorporates the name of the subject of study into the degree title and generally requires more specialized coursework than a degree with an untagged major.

Tagged degrees come in two varieties:

 the first form is a more general bachelor's or master's degree with a specialty tag appended to the title (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Nursing);
 the second form is even more specialized (e.g., Master of Business Administration, Doctor of Medicine, etc.) and is generally associated with a professional education curriculum.
