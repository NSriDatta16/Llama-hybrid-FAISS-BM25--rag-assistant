Paul Young version

Background
English singer Paul Young recorded a cover version of the song titled "Every Time You Go Away" for his studio album The Secret of Association in 1985. His cover features a combination of echoed piano, the Yamaha DX7's "harp" preset, the distinctive fretless bass of Pino Palladino, as well as a Coral electric sitar and a Ovation Spanish acoustic guitar, which were both played by John Turnbull.

In March 1985, Young's version hit No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It was among the songs he performed at Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium in London on 13 July 1985. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 two weeks later, and was one of two top 10 hits Young had on the U.S. pop singles chart (the second being his 1990 cover of "Oh Girl" by the Chi-Lites). "Every Time You Go Away" also topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart for two weeks. The song won British Video of the Year at the 1986 Brit Awards.

Reception
John Leland of Spin wrote, "What can you say bad about Paul Young, except perhaps that he generally doles out incredibly bland versions of even blander songs? Here, dispensing with his penchant for ersatz British soul, caresses it into warmly moving fuck music."
