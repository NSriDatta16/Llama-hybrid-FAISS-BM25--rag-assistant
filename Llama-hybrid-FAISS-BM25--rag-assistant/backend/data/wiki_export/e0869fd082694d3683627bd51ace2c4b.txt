She committed suicide on 10 July 1986 by overdosing on lidocaine.  In a radio interview, shortly before her death, she complained of being harassed by the public saying: "I don't know whether I can bear this, everybody is harassing me. They ask: Where and from whom did you get those beautiful clothes? Who helped you? Do you or your father have special connections with the jury? And so on".

She was the subject of a 1987 book Isten óvd a királynőt! – a felszabadulás utáni első – eddig egyetlen – magyar szépségkirálynő, Molnár Csilla Andrea életének és halálának hiteles dokumentumai ("God Save the Queen! – the first authentic documentary on the life and death of Csilla Andrea Molnár, the first – and so far only – Hungarian beauty queen after the liberation") by   (HP Hungaroprop Kulturális Kiadó, ).
