Professional career

Dallas Cowboys
Owens was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (89th overall) of the 1965 NFL Draft. He was converted into a safety during training camp. He spent most of the year on the team's taxi squad. On August 30, 1966, he was traded, along with Jake Kupp and Mitch Johnson, to the Washington Redskins for Jim Steffen and a fifth-round draft choice (#119-Willie Parker).

Washington Redskins
In 1970, he was named the starter at strong safety. He remained with the Redskins until he retired after the 1977 season. He played a significant role in leading the 1972 squad to Super Bowl VII and had a good performance in the game, recording a key interception from Miami Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese in the end zone during the second half.

One of his more memorable performances occurred on a 1966 regular season game against the New York Giants, where he scored two defensive touchdowns: a 62-yard interception return and a 62-yard fumble return.  Washington ended up winning the game 72–41.  To this day it is the highest scoring game in NFL history.

Owens holds the record for most interception return yards in Redskins history (686) and is second all-time for the Redskins in career interceptions (36).  Three of his interceptions were returned for touchdowns.  He also recovered ten fumbles, returning them for 143 yards and two touchdowns.
