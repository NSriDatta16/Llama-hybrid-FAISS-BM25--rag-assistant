The Sultan of Perak (سلطان ڤيراق) is one of the oldest hereditary seats among the Malay states.

When the Sultanate of Malacca empire fell to Portugal in 1511, Sultan Mahmud Syah I retreated to Kampar, Sumatra, and died there in 1528. He left behind two princes named Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II and Sultan Muzaffar Syah. The former went on to establish the Sultanate of Johor. Muzaffar Syah was invited to rule Perak, and he became the first sultan of Perak.

Line of succession to the Perak throne 

In contrast to the other Malay sultanates, the ruling dynasty of Perak utilises a somewhat complex order of succession.

The reigning Sultan appoints princes in the male line of descent from a Sultan to certain high princely titles. They are arranged in a strict order of precedence indicating the order of succession to the throne. As per ruling of 25 February 1953, the present hierarchy of titles and the corresponding order of succession is as follows:

  (Crown Prince, currently Raja Jaafar)
  (Deputy Crown Prince, currently Raja Iskandar Dzulkarnain)
  (currently Raja Azlan Muzzaffar Shah)
  (currently Raja Ahmad Nazim Azlan Shah)
  (currently Raja Iskandar)
  (vacant)

While titleholders are usually appointed for life, titles may be revoked in cases of proven incompetence or disability. On the death or promotion of an existing titleholder, the holder of the next most senior title succeeds him. The  is the heir apparent, and succeeds the ruling sultan on his demise, whereupon the prince holding the title of  becomes the new . The Raja Kechil Besar then becomes the . The new Sultan may then appoint his own nominee to the junior-most title made vacant by these successions.

The 2 most senior titleholders are confirmed by a majority vote of the representatives of the Perak State Legislative Assembly.
