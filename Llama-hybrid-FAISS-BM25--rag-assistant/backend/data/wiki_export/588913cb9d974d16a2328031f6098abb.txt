He finished his habilitation on DNA repair proteins at the Eidgenössischen Technischen Hochschule Zürich in 1998. From 2000 till 2004 he was Professor for organic chemistry  at the University of Marburg until he became Professor for organic chemistry at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. His main interest is still the DNA repair system.

In 2004, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 2008, he was awarded the  for his work on the DNA repair systems. In 2008 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.
