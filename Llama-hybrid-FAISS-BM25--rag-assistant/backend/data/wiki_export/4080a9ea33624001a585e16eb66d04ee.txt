The General Union of Moroccan Workers (, UGTM) is a national trade union center in Morocco. It was formed March 20, 1960 and has a membership of 695,000.

The UGTM has its roots in the agricultural workers of Morocco, although it does have public and private sector workers as well. ICTUR reports that the UGTM is historically seen as less militant than other federations, but did participate in the demands for reform which occurred in the 1990s.

The UGTM is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation.
