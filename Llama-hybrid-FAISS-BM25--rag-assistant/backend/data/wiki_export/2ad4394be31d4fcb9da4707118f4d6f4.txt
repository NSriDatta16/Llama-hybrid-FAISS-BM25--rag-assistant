Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque (12 November 1855 – 8 January 1902) was a Portuguese cavalry officer. He captured Gungunhana in Chaimite (1895) and was governor-general of Mozambique. He was a grandson of Luís da Silva Mouzinho de Albuquerque.

Mouzinho de Albuquerque was born in Batalha, and died in Lisbon.

Career

Having served in India during the 1880s, Mouzinho de Albuquerque was highly respected in Portuguese society of the 19th and 20th centuries. He was seen as the hope and symbol of Portuguese reaction to threats against Portuguese interests in Africa from other European empires.

He married his cousin Maria José Mascarenhas de Mendonça Gaivão (Lagoa, 23 July 1857 –Lisbon, 2 September 1950), without issue.

He was governor of Gaza Province and Mozambique until 1898 when he returned to Portugal. During his time as governor, Mouzinho served as commander of a cavalry squadron that fought Gungunhane. On 28 December 1895 Mouzinho captured Gungunhane in Chaimite without firing a gunshot.

He was the instructor of Crown Prince Luís Filipe.
 
He allegedly committed suicide at the entrance of the Jardim das Laranjeiras in Lisbon on 8 January 1902 (some sources claim he was killed).

Honours

He was depicted in a 20 Portuguese escudo note issued in the 1940s.

Memorial
The Rotunda da Boavista, also known as the Praça de Mouzinho de Albuquerque, honors the soldier.
