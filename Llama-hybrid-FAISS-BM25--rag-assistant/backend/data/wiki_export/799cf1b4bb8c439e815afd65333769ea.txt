Gift Horse is a studio album by the folk rock band Lost Dogs. It was released in 1999 on BEC Records.

This turned out to be Gene Eugene's last album with the band, as he died in The Green Room shortly after its release. BEC Records retitled one song as "A Vegas Story" for the album's artwork. To this day, fans of the band continue to call it by its real name, "Free Drinks and a Dream". The song also goes by that name during concert performances and on later live albums and videos.
