Club career
Sabillón began his career with Marathón in 1999 and remained at the club for more than ten years and was viewed as one of the team's top players. While with Marathón, the technically skilled Sabillón played primarily as a right back. During his decade with  Marathón, they enjoyed the greatest period in its history capturing six domestic titles during that time.

China
His play with Marathón drew the interest of Chinese club Hangzhou Greentown whom he joined in 2010. In his one season with Hangzhou Sabillón appeared in 24 league matches helping the club to a fourth-place finish and qualification to the 2011 AFC Champions League Group stage. After one season in China Sabillón returned to Marathón.

On January 27, 2011 Sabillón confirmed that he received an offer from Major League Soccer side New York Red Bulls, but a deal had to be agreed to with Marathón as he has a year remaining on his contract.

He helped Honduras qualify for the 2010 World Cup. There was speculation that his move to Hangzhou Greentown could jeopardize his selection  to the World Cup squad, however coach Reinaldo Rueda included Sabillón in the 23 man squad.
