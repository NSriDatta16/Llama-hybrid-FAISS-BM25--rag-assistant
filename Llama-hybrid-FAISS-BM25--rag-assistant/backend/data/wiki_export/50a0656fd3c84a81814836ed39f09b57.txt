V. Mapa station is an elevated Manila Light Rail Transit (LRT) station situated on Line 2. It is one of the four stations in the line with a reserve track nearby (in front of the UERMMC) together with Santolan, Anonas and Araneta Center–Cubao. The station during its inception was formerly called as G. Araneta station but was renamed into the current name due to the minor realignment of some stations (the other being Betty Go-Belmonte) that has caused the change of proximity to the V. Mapa Street. The station serves the areas of Santa Mesa, Manila, Quezon City, and San Juan. The station is located at Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard, near its intersection with Victorino Mapa Street in Santa Mesa, Manila.

The station is the tenth station for trains headed to Recto and the fourth station for trains headed to Antipolo. The station has a standard layout, with a concourse level and a platform level.

It is named after its location near the junction with V. Mapa Street, which was in turn named after Victorino Mapa, the second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines.
