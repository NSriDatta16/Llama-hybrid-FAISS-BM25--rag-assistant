Stock car racing events in the NASCAR Xfinity Series has been held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina since the series' inaugural season in 1982. Currently, the track holds two races in the spring (as companion to Rebel 400) named Shriners Childrenâ€™s 200 and fall (as companion to Southern 500) named Sport Clips Haircuts VFW 200, both being  in distance. 

Initially only one race was held, but starting in 1984 the track hosted two races per year until 2004 when the track lost its fall weekend date as a result of the realignments caused by the Ferko lawsuit. A realignment in 2015 moved the spring race to the pre-Ferko fall slot. The emergency schedule realignment for 2020 resulted in Darlington regaining its second Xfinity date, which became permanent starting from 2021.
