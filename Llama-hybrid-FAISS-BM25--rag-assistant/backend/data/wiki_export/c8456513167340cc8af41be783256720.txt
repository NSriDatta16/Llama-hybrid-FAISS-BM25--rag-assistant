Southside Story is a New Zealand compilation album released by Dawn Raid Entertainment in 2000.  This album was Dawn Raid's first album release.

History
Southside Story was released in April 2000 at the Otara Leisure Centre at a release party including attendance by Che Fu, King Kapisi, P Money and DJ Sirvere who were there to support what at the time was a first for New Zealand Hip Hop music. It was the first album produced by Dawn Raid and was made on a shoe string budget. The album marked Dawn Raid Entertainment's official entry into the music business and was recorded at Kevy Kev's One Love Studios in Grey Lynn. It introduced unknown artists at the time including 4 Corners, Ill Semantics, K.A.O.S, Native Sons and Brotha D (formerly of the Lost Tribe).
