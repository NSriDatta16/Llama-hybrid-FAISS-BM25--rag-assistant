Steve Turner is an English music journalist, biographer, and poet, who grew up in Northamptonshire, England.

Career
Turner's first published article was in the Beatles Monthly in 1969. His career as a journalist began as features editor of Beat Instrumental, where he interviewed many of the prominent rock musicians of the 1970s. He subsequently freelanced for music magazines such as Melody Maker, NME and Rolling Stone.

During the 1980s, he wrote extensively for British newspapers and magazines on a range of subjects as well as produced his study of the relationship between rock music and religion, Hungry For Heaven, and co-authored U2: Rattle & Hum, the book of the eponymous 1988 film. In the 1990s, he began devoting himself to full-length books. The first was a best-selling biography of British music star Cliff Richard, Cliff Richard: The Biography (1993), which stayed on the Sunday Times bestseller list for six weeks.

He has also written a number of poetry books for both adults and children. The first of his books for children, The Day I Fell Down The Toilet, has sold over 120,000 copies, and total sales for his children's poetry collection exceeds 200,000. His other poetry collections for children are: Dad, You're Not Funny, The Moon Has Got His Pants On, I Was Only Asking and Don't Take Your Elephant To School.
