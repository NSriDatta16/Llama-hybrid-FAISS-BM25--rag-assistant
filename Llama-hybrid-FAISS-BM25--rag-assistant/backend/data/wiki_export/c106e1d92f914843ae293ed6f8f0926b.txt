Extensive buildings and plant for sugar manufacturing were included in the estate.

Natural environment

Pre-clearing, the vegetation of Ashmore included substantial areas of blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) tall open forest on lowland metamorphosed sediments. This ecosystem type is now listed as endangered with extinction in Queensland having been extensively cleared for agriculture and housing development.

The area now occupied by Royal Pines resort once supported established Eucalyptus tereticornis forests and wetlands with patches of rainforest. Jabiru, magpie geese and a variety of water birds used these wetlands which stretched from Nerang to near Burleigh Heads along the floodplain of the Nerang River Valley and Mudgeereebah and Bonogin Creeks. This ecosystem was akin to Kakadu with lagoons of lilypads, swamp rainforest and gnarled old paperbark forest filled with palms. In the 1980s prior to the development of Royal Pines resort, farmland with remnant degraded wetlands and some forest remained, and jabiru, spoonbills, magpie geese and a variety of other birds could be seen there. Development in recent decades has led to the loss of most remnant natural vegetation.
