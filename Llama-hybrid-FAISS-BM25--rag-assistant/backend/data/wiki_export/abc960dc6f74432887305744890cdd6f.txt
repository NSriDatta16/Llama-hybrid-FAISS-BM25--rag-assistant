The 1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series was the 46th season of NASCAR professional stock car racing in the United States and the 23rd modern-era Cup series. The season began on Sunday, February 20, and ended on Sunday, November 13. Dale Earnhardt of Richard Childress Racing was crowned champion at season's end, winning consecutive Winston Cups for the third time in his career and tying Richard Petty for the record of most top-level NASCAR championships with seven. It was also the 7th and final NASCAR Winston Cup Series Championship for Dale Earnhardt before his death 7 years later in 2001; this was also the final season for 18-time Winston Cup winner Harry Gant.

One of the highlights of the season occurred on August 6, when the NASCAR Winston Cup Series made a highly publicized first visit to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway for the inaugural Brickyard 400. This season also marked the end of the second of two tire wars, as Hoosier left NASCAR after the season-ending Atlanta race, leaving Goodyear as the series' exclusive tire distributor.

The season was marred with tragedy, as Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr were killed in separate practice crashes prior to the Daytona 500 and in August at Michigan International Speedway when Ernie Irvan suffered near fatal injuries due to a practice crash.

Failed to qualify: 71-Dave Marcis, 20-Bobby Hillin Jr., 19-Loy Allen Jr., 55-Tim Fedewa, 98-Jeremy Mayfield

8th and final win of 1994 for Rusty Wallace. This marked back-to-back seasons for Rusty Wallace winning the most races in a season (winning 10 races in 1993), but unfortunately, even though he scored most wins in back-to-back seasons, a major lack of consistency in both years kept him from winning back-to-back Winston Cup Championships.
This would be the 2nd time in his career that Rusty Wallace scored the most victories in back-to-back seasons. He scored 10 wins in 1993, and 8 wins in 1994. The 1st time he did this, he won the most races in 1988 and 1989, scoring 6 wins each. However, Rusty shared that feat in 1988 with that season's champion Bill Elliott, and he also shared that feat in 1989 with Darrell Waltrip, and as a bonus for 1989, Rusty won the championship that year.
This would be the final time that Rusty Wallace scored the most victories in a single season.
Last career Top 10 for Harry Gant.

Dale Earnhardt clinched his 7th and final NASCAR Winston Cup Championship with 2 races to go, tying him with Richard Petty for most championships of all time. In the Bob Latford Winston Cup points system, a driver can clinch the championship with 2 races to go if he has a 370+ point lead over 2nd, and Dale Earnhardt did just that by having a 448-point lead over Rusty Wallace at the end of the race. This would become the 4th and final time in Bob Latford's Winston Cup points system that a driver would clinch the Winston Cup Championship with 2 or more races to go. Earnhardt had already joined Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough when he won the title with 2 races to go in 1987, but as of 2018, the 1994 and 7th championship would make Dale Earnhardt the only driver in NASCAR history to clinch the title twice with 2 races to go. In 1987, his 1st accomplishment, Dale clinched his 3rd championship with 2 races to go by 515 points over Bill Elliott. In 1978, Cale Yarborough clinched his 3rd consecutive Winston Cup Championship with 2 races to go by 396 points over Bobby Allison, but in 1975 however, Richard Petty clinched his 6th championship with 4 races to go because his point lead was 740+ over 2nd. His margin was 827 points over James Hylton. Petty's championship win with 4 races to go is the earliest for a driver to clinch a championship in NASCAR history. Also as of 2021, this feat can never happen again due to several changes in the points system after 2003.
With this 7th championship, Dale Earnhardt ties Richard Petty for most Championships in NASCAR Cup Series history. In 2016, future driver Jimmie Johnson would become the 3rd driver to win 7 championships. 
As of 2021, Dale Earnhardt is the only driver in NASCAR history to win 7 championships under one points system (Richard Petty won 7 titles under 5 points systems, and future 7-time champion Jimmie Johnson won 7 titles under 4 points systems).
The race itself came down to a photo finish with Earnhardt prevailing over Rick Mast.

Dale Earnhardt would officially win his 7th and final NASCAR Winston Cup championship by 444 points over Mark Martin, the 4th largest point margin in Bob Latford's Winston Cup points system history. The largest point margin in the Winston Cup points system was back in 1975, when Richard Petty won his 6th championship by 722 points over Dave Marcis, the 2nd largest point margin was in 1987, when Earnhardt himself won his 3rd title by 489 points over Bill Elliott, and the 3rd largest point margin was in 1978, when Cale Yarborough won his 3rd consecutive Winston Cup Championship by 474 points over Bobby Allison.

Rookie of the Year 
A record eight drivers declared intentions to run for Maxx Racing Card Rookie of the Year before the 1994 season: brothers, Ward and Jeff Burton, John Andretti, T. W. Taylor, Joe Nemechek, Steve Grissom, Rick Carelli, and Loy Allen Jr. Taylor and Carelli dropped out early after a series of DNQs, while Billy Standridge joined the rookie of the year race with Johnson-Standridge Racing in March. Mike Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield took part once they secured full-time rides in March as well.    
    
Jeff Burton, driving the No. 8 Ford for Stavola Brothers Racing, was named Rookie of the Year for 1994, posting two top-five finishes. He was followed by fellow Busch Series graduates Grissom and Nemechek, each of whom had three top-ten finishes. Allen, despite three poles, struggled to find consistency and finished far back in the standings, while Mayfield and Andretti showed promise with different rides throughout the season. Mike Wallace (who started the year at Atlanta in March) and Ward Burton were plagued by qualifying troubles all season long. Standridge ran a partial schedule and was not a factor. Rich Bickle declared to run for the award in 1993, but failed to make enough races so he was technically still eligible for the award in 1994. Although, he did not officially declare to run as a rookie for the 1994 season and was deemed ineligible for the award despite making the required number of races.
