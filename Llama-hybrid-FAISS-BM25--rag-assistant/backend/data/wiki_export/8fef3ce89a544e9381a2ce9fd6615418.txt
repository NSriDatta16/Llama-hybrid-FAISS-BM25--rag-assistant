The journal was funded through the City of San Antonio and the culture-based arts organization, Centro Cultural de Aztlan. A veteran free-lance writer, Castillo authored articles germane to the Mexican American community and established philosophy-based issues and supported international causes that promoted Mexican American arts and letters. He later served as contributing editor of The Saguaro,a literary journal published at the University of Arizona, Tucson. In 1985, Castillo visited Paris, France, and met briefly with David Appelfield, editor of FRANK, an international literary journal, and became its San Antonio correspondent.
