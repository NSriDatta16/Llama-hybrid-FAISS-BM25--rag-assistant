History
The club was founded as a part of the football section in the Olympia sports club (Novorossiysk) in the summer of 1907, and on September 30, 1907, the first international match between the Olympia club and the sailors of a merchant ship from England took place, the match ended in a draw 2:2. The Club changed name for Cement Novorossiysk in 1960 and was known by its name in 1960–1969 and 1978–1991. In 1970–1977, the clubs was called Trud Novorossiysk, in 1992–1993 Gekris Novorossiysk, and in 2005 FC Novorossiysk. Chernomorets is Russian for "a man from Black Sea".

The club played in class B of the Soviet football in 1960–1970. After this they did not participate in Soviet championships until 1978, when they entered the Second League. They played there until the dissolution of USSR, and in 1992 were entitled to enter the Russian First Division. They spent three years there. After a third place in 1992 they won their regional group in 1993, but did not succeed in the promotion-relegation tournament. A victory in the First Division in 1994 brought them automatic promotion.

Chernomorets stayed in the Top Division from 1995 to 2001. Their best result was sixth position in 1997 and 2000. The latter entitled them to a place in the UEFA Cup, where they were knocked out in the first round by Valencia.

In 2002 Chernomorets won promotion straight back, but were relegated again in 2003. After the 2004 season in the First Division, Chernomorets were denied a professional licence. The club was reorganized, renamed FC Novorossiysk and entered the Amateur Football League for the 2005 season. In the course of the season the team was renamed Chernomorets again.
