Cindy Beale (also Williams) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Michelle Collins. She first appeared 10 May 1988 and originally departed on 27 December 1990, before returning as one of the show's central antagonists from 13 October 1992 until her exit episode on 10 April 1998; the character supposedly died off-screen during childbirth on 5 November 1998. During her first stint on the show, Cindy embarked on a prolonged relationship with her would-be husband Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Their marriage soon deteriorated, however, due to Cindy's selfish streak that shows the character becoming unfaithful to Ian and growing more concerned about her own needs than their own children. She lies and schemes to ensure that she gets what she wants.

It was reported on 19 May 2023 that Collins would be making a shock return to the show after 25 years away, thus "resurrecting" the character from the dead. She returned on 21 June 2023 for two episodes where it is revealed that Cindy never died and that under the witness protection programme, she had assumed the identity of Rose Knight, the wife of George Knight (Colin Salmon) and the mother of Gina (Francesca Henry) and Anna (Molly Rainford). She returned full-time on 22 August 2023. The decision to reintroduce Cindy was praised by critics.

Storylines

1988–1990
Cindy Beale first arrives at Albert Square in May 1988, wherein she begins working on her mother's market stall selling hats. She dates barman Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), who is also seeing Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), leading Cindy and Donna to fight for Simon's attention. However, Cindy grows tired of Simon's womanising, and despite his feelings for her, she moves on to Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who is becoming a successful entrepreneur. Initially she only wants to make Simon jealous but she and Ian start dating and by February 1989, they announce their engagement. Meanwhile, Simon retaliates by reconciling with Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). However, while working together late one night at The Queen Victoria public house, Cindy and Simon have sex and Cindy becomes pregnant. She suggests leaving Ian for Simon but he refuses, not wanting to be tied down or upset his family so Cindy marries Ian, letting him think he is the baby's father, giving birth to Steven in December 1989. However, Simon decides he wants to be a father to his son and convinces Cindy to leave Ian, devastating him with the news that Steven is not his son and a feud erupts when he realises Simon is the father. Ian's behaviour grows erratic; after attempting suicide and failing, he chooses to ruin Simon's life instead so Simon decides to leave Walford with Cindy and Steven, leaving Ian heartbroken.

1992–1998
In 1992, Ian discovers that Simon has abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian persuades her to return to Walford so he can help her bring Steven up. They reunite and Cindy gets pregnant in 1993. Richard Cole (Ian Reddington) is romantically interested in Cindy but she rejects him, so Richard tells people that he is the father of her twins. Everyone believes him, and Ian and Cindy almost separate but the truth emerges, just before Lucy and Peter are born in December. Married life and motherhood takes its toll on Cindy and she has two affairs, first with Matt (Toby Walton), a lifeguard, in 1994, and then with Simon's half-brother, David Wicks (Michael French), also Ian's half-brother, in 1995. Cindy and David meet secretly for a year and she falls in love with David, growing less and less tolerant of Ian. Suspecting Cindy is cheating, Ian hires a private investigator, who records Cindy and David in a clinch. Ian vows to take Cindy to court for custody of their children. David loses interest in Cindy so she takes drastic action and in October 1996, she hires John Valecue (Steve Weston), a hitman to kill Ian. Although she changes her mind, it is too late and Ian is shot, collapsing in a pool of blood in front of Cindy. The police suspect Cindy is involved and when David is called in for questioning, Cindy knows she will soon be arrested, so decides to flee with her children. Assisted by David and Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson), she collects her sons, but is unable to get Lucy, and is forced to leave without her. David also stays behind, promising Cindy that he will try to get Lucy and join her later, but he never does.

Ian's private investigator, Ros Thorne (Clare Grogan) tracks Cindy to Italy in 1997. Ian, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) find her, and Phil and Grant abduct Steven and Peter while Ian claims he still loves Cindy and will forgive her. Desperate to get her daughter back, Cindy goes along with him but grows suspicious and calls the police, but it is too late. Despite a police chase, Ian brings his sons back to Walford. Cindy soon follows Ian back to Walford with her new boyfriend, Nick Holland (Dominic Taylor). She takes Ian to court for custody of the children and wins. However, while collecting her children, Cindy is arrested for conspiracy to murder when Ian's associates visit Valecue in prison while he is serving a life sentence for murder, and persuade him to tell the police about Cindy's involvement. Ian wins full custody of the children and Cindy is charged and remanded while she is pregnant by Nick. After realising Cindy is guilty, Nick leaves her without any money for a lawyer. 

In November 1998, Ian receives news that Cindy had died in childbirth. Her daughter survives and is named Cindy by Ian, in her mother's honour. Custody is given to Cindy's sister, Gina Williams (Nicola Cowper). However, unbeknownst to her family and Ian, Cindy has entered into witness protection from a plea bargain after having made a deal in prison to give information against her inmate Jackie Ford, in order to avoid a prison sentence for conspiring to kill Ian. It had failed and led to Cindy having to fake her death to escape Jackie's criminal connections. She assumes the new identity of "Rose Sawyer" and marries George Knight (Colin Salmon). They have two daughters, Gina (Francesca Henry) and Anna (Molly Rainford). Whilst living in Marbella in 2014, Rose leaves George following a heated argument and isn't seen or heard from again.

2023–present
In June 2023, George, Gina and Anna arrive in Walford to run The Queen Vic with his girlfriend, Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe) and her daughter, Linda Carter (Kellie Bright). Linda does not trust George and becomes suspicious of his mysterious ex-wife Rose. She asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to find Rose. After attempting to press George for details, he later reveals to Linda that Rose suddenly left him. Linda is not convinced and Phil later tells George that there is no record of Rose, after his lawyer Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber) attempts to find her. Shocked by this, George later attempts to phone Rose, and Cindy is revealed to be her true identity after she receives George's call but does not answer. Cindy has been living in France with Ian, Peter (now Thomas Law), and his son, Louie Beale (Freddie Harrington). Cindy's witness protection officer informs her that Jackie has died and she is free to return to her former life. Ian and Cindy argue when Ian suggests that they return to Walford and he later falls into cardiac arrest. Cindy later agrees to return to Walford, however, Ian sees a video via Peter that his son Bobby (Clay Milner Russell) sent him of Cindy's ex-husband George, as the Queen Victoria pub landlord, and tells Cindy that they should remain in France. 

Anna hires a private investigator to track Rose down. This causes friction between her and Gina, who takes cocaine to cope. He returns with an active phone number, which Anna calls but goes unanswered, leaving a voicemail and a text message. Peter discovers the voicemail thus finding out he has two sisters. Ian deletes the voicemail and text message, however, Peter returns to Walford to meet Gina and Anna. Cindy follows him to London and visits Kathy, who is furious to discover Cindy is alive and has reconciled with Ian and Peter. Ian arrives to bring Cindy home but is too late to stop her bumping into George, who is hosting Anna's 21st birthday party at the Vic. Cindy explains her true identity to George, explaining she compromised her life with him in witness protection by briefly returning to Walford in 2014 when her daughter Lucy was murdered. Believing the Fords killed Lucy, Cindy chose not to return to Marbella in fear of endangering George, Gina and Anna. Against George's wishes, Cindy is reunited with Gina and Anna, who are both wary of their long-absent mother. Unable to cope with Cindy's reappearance, Gina takes drugs on a night out and is rushed to hospital. Cindy is horrified to learn that Gina has a drug problem, and George blames her return for Gina's relapse. Contemplating their future in Walford, Cindy realises Ian knew that her daughters were in Walford but agrees to forgive his deceit if he helps her reconcile with them.

Creation and development
Cindy was introduced in 1988 in a minor role as a love-interest for Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). She was due to appear in only eleven episodes but the character evolved. Writer Colin Brake has suggested that Cindy was "the most important character for the future" to be introduced in 1988, despite her low-key entrance.

Actress Michelle Collins was asked to audition for the part by the soap's co-creator, Julia Smith, who saw her perform on stage. Collins had previously auditioned for the role of original character Mary Smith, but at the time Julia Smith had decided they did not want that character to be from London, so that role went to Linda Davidson. Three years on, Collins won the role of Cindy. She has commented, "Cindy arrived for 11 episodes, working on a hat stall and as a tease for Wicksy, but evolved into a much juicier character. Julia Smith said it would change my life. I didn't believe her - how wrong I was."

In 2015, former executive producer Matthew Robinson explained in a blog post why he had Cindy killed off, saying that keeping her alive "might have benefited the show" but it would have required Collins to commit to three days of filming to depict the birth of Cindy's baby and the outcome of her trial, because "no proper producer could allow off-screen portrayal of massive soap events like those". However, Collins never committed to the episodes and Robinson felt he had no choice but to kill the character off-screen.

Reintroduction
On 19 May 2023, it was reported that Collins would be returning to the show after 25 years in a storyline accommodating the return of Ian, thus resurrecting the character from the dead.

Reception
In 2020, Sara Wallis and Ian Hyland from The Daily Mirror placed Cindy 20th on their ranked list of the best EastEnders characters of all time, calling her "scheming", "Selfish" and a "Homewrecker" who "worked her way through most of Walford's men in her 10-year stint, but settled for boring Ian".

After her 2023 return, The Daily Telegraph described the scenes as a "camp, compelling Bank Holiday treat". They gave the episodes a review of four stars out of a possible five and joked: "Who needs Barbie when we've got Cindy?" and billed her as a "peroxide piranha". They opined that her return to EastEnders was what the show needed to regain buzz amidst live ratings dropping in 2023. Radio Times praised executive producer Chris Clenshaw's decision to reintroduce her and said that her "epic" return "more than lived up to expectations". Likewise, Digital Spy praised all aspects of Cindy's return as they felt that despite the extravagant nature of the storyline, EastEnders had not gone overboard by bringing her back.
