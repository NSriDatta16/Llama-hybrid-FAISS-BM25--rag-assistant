Salisbury International Arts Festival (founded in 1974) is an annual multi-arts festival that delivers over 150 arts events each year in and around the city of Salisbury, England. Events include concerts, comedy, poetry, dance, exhibitions, outdoor spectacles, and commissioned works.

The festival makes use of the surrounding landscape, hosting events in settings including the ancient circles of Stonehenge, Old Wardour Castle, the Wiltshire chalk downs, and Salisbury Cathedral. Every four years a new director is chosen to deliver the annual festival.

In 2018 the festival organisers amalgamated with Salisbury Playhouse and Salisbury Arts Centre to form Wiltshire Creative.

 Festival director: Jo Metcalf

The 2006 festival programme reflected the theme of 'Relate': how people connect with one another locally and as a global community. There was a strong artistic emphasis on storytelling, recurring motifs relating to the environment and atmosphere, and images of wings, clouds, birds, fairytales, myths, and dreams.  These themes were exemplified in the Aboriginal Cultural Showcase, which featured a wide range of indigenous Australian artists, many of whom were visiting the UK for the first time.
