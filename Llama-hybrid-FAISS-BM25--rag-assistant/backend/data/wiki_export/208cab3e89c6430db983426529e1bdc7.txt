History 
The first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, donated a chapel in São João da Foz in 1145. In the 13th century the chapel became part of the Benedictine monastery of Santo Tirso. The borders of the parish, called Couto da Foz, were limited by the city of Bouças (Matosinhos) in the north and Porto, to the east.
