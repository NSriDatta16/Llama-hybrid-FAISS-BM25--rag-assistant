Roger Verity created the term "exerges", writing: "[Exerges] always inhabit different land-areas, except in particular cases, such as large mountain chains and plains, which afford very different surroundings and climates within the same area; they often consist in a long chain of races stretching even from one continent to another ..." The modern term is cline.
