Eunos Bus Interchange is a bus interchange located in Geylang East, Singapore. It is located and built beside Eunos MRT station and is surrounded by Eunos Road 2, Eunos Crescent and Sims Avenue.

The interchange is designed with traditional Malay roof structure and shape, but using modern materials such as steel beams, similar to that of the Eunos MRT station. It gives a sense of identity to the area as the bus interchange lies close to Geylang and also to honour Eunos Abdullah whom secured 700-hectares of land for the Malay settlements in the early 1900s.

This bus interchange is one of the few bus interchanges not located in the respective town centre.
