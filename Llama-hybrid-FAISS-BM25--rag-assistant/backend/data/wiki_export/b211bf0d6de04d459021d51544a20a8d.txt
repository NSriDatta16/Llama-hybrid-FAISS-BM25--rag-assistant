Chun Chil-sung (Hangul: 전칠성, Hanja: 全七星; born July 7, 1961, in Sinan, Jeollanam-do, South Korea) is a retired South Korean boxer.

Amateur career
Chun managed a career record of 100-6 during his amateur career.

In 1983, Chun won the silver medal in lightweight (–60 kg) at the 3rd Boxing World Cup in Rome, Italy. He defeated 1983 European lightweight champion Emil Chuprenski of Bulgaria in the semifinal bout.

Next year, he won the bronze medal in the lightweight division at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. In the semifinals he was defeated by eventual winner Pernell Whitaker of the United States by 0-5 unanimous decision, but this is considered one of the controversial pro-American jury decisions in the boxing competitions at the 1984 Olympics.
