The WATC Derby, also known as the Western Australia Derby is a Perth Racing Group 2 Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds, at set weights, over a distance of 2400 metres at Ascot Racecourse in Perth, Western Australia in April. Total prizemoney is $400,000.

History
The inaugural running of the race was on 2 January 1888 as the first race on the second day of WATC Summer Meeting which was highlighted by The Queen's Plate. The race was called the West Australia Derby, with prizemoney  of 100 sovereigns with an additional sweep of 2 sovereigns for the second place horse. Colonial bred horses were allowed 5 pounds allowance. The filly, Harridan started as the even money favourite and won by 2 lengths.

The race continued to be part of the WATC Summer Carnival until 1988 when it was moved to April. The club reverted to the summer schedule in 1993 but by 2002 the race was again being held in April.
