Stoneyford Road Secondary Modern School opened in 1958, as a four stream coeducational school., costing £105,000. Stanton Hill School opened in September 1955, a coeducational school with 200 in 6 classrooms.

Buildings
The school has recently undergone redecoration in several areas. The science block has had its classrooms refurnished, and modernised. And other classrooms have been converted into new computer rooms. Several of the subject blocks have been moved around, with only English, P.E, Science, Technology and the sixth form building being exempted from this re-arrangement. The school is now undergoing further improvements on blocks which didn't receive redecoration.

The school has 6.9% authorised absences which is marginally above the national average. It also experiences 3% unauthorised absences which is over three times the national level. The proportion achieving five A* to C passes, including in English and mathematics, is well above average and continues to rise. Sutton Community Academy, a nearby ‘competitor’, is often shown worse than Quarrydale in the league tables and general image.
