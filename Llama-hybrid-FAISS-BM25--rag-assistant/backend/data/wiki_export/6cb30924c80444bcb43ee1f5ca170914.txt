Paco is a Spanish nickname for Francisco. According to folk etymology, the nickname has its origins in Saint Francis of Assisi, who was the father of the Franciscan order; his name was written in Latin by the order as  (father of the community); hence "Paco" was supposedly obtained by taking the first syllable of each word.
