Local politics
Berg founded the Executive Director of the Area Agency on Aging serving Humboldt and Del Norte Counties for 19 years. While there, she grew the agency from a staff of 4 and a budget of $300,000 to 25 employees and a multimillion-dollar budget. Berg was a regional leader advocating for policy change in Sacramento and Washington, DC on issues related to aging.

In 1993, she wrote the Humboldt County Crime Prevention Plan and chaired its first Crime Commission. Berg then worked in partnership with law enforcement taking a number of steps to make local citizens safer.

Berg has a history as an advocate for women's rights and a woman's right to choose. In 1982, she helped found "CHOICES" Humboldt County's first pro-choice Political Action Committee. She also developed California's first K-12 comprehensive family life education curriculum in 1980, which was implemented in 80% of Humboldt County School Districts.
