The Hoensha was a Japanese Go organization founded in 1879 by Honinbo Shuho. The Hoensha was the successor to study groups set up by Nakagawa Kamesaburo and other players. It was the major Go organization of the later Meiji period. Like the many Go organizations today, the Hoensha awarded professional grades. The Hoensha house magazine was Igo Shinpo. The Four Heavenly Kings of Hoensha were Kobayashi Tetsujiro, Mizutani Nuiji, Sakai Yasujiro, and Takahashi Kinesaburo. The Three Wunderkinder were Ishii Senji, Sugioka Eijiro, and Tamura Yasuhisa (Honinbo Shusai). When Nihon Ki-in was established, the Hoensha was dissolved in 1924.
