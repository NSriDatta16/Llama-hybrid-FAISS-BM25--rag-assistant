History
On 1 January 1838, the large municipality of Rendal was established. This municipality spanned  from the Østerdalen valley to the border with Sweden. During the 1870s, discussions began on dividing the large municipality. On 1 January 1880, the municipality of Rendal was split in two to create the municipalities of Øvre Rendal (population: 1,868) and Ytre Rendal (population: 1,661). The new municipality of Øvre Rendal had an area of . On 1 January 1911, the new municipality of Engerdal was established to the east of Øvre Rendal. This new municipality was created by taking  of eastern Øvre Rendal, plus area from the neighboring municipalities of Ytre Rendal, Tolga, and Trysil. This portion of Øvre Rendal that became part of Engerdal had 381 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the new municipality of Rendalen was created by merging Øvre Rendal (population: 1,629) and Ytre Rendal (population: 1,913).

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Rendalen valley (). In 1880, the large municipality of Rendal was divided to create two new municipalities. Both municipalities were named after the old municipality and to distinguish between the two, an additional word was added to the name. The word  was added to this name and the word  was added to the other municipality. The word  means "upper" (while  means "outer"). The first element of Rendal is  which means "reindeer". The last element is  which means "valley" or "dale". The river Rena runs through the valley and it is not known if the valley was named after the river or if the river was named after the valley. A nearby mountain Renafjellet also has a similar name.
