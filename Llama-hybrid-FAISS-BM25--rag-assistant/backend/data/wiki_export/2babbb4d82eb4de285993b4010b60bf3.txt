Teboho Patrick Mokoena  (born 10 July 1974 in Thokoza, Gauteng) is a South African association football player. He last played as a midfielder for Mpumalanga Black Aces F.C.

Career
Teboho is resisting the temptation of giving up on football by keeping fit in the amateur ranks. It is now more than two months since Bidvest Wits chose not to renew the 34-year-old's contract and Mokoena says he still wants to keep his fitness level up to a competitive standard.
