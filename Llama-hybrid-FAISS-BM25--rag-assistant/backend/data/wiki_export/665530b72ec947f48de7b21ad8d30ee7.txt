It is a two-disc DVD set chronicling Phish's two-day summer festival in Limestone, Maine on August 2-3, 2003. The first disc contains a full-length documentary originally aired on PBS in 2004, featuring interviews with the band, song excerpts, and images from the concert grounds and festival events. This was the sixth of ten major outdoor summer festivals held by Phish.

The second disc features complete performances of ten songs from the festival. It does not contain the entire festival, nor any of the concerts they played there, in their uninterrupted entirety.

The DVD set, which clocks in at over four hours, was certified platinum in 2005.
