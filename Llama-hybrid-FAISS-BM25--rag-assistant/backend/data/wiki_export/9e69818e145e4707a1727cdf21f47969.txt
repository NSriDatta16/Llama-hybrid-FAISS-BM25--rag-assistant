History

Formation and debut album (1999–2002) 
In 1999, BulletBoys guitarist DJ Ashba and Bang Tango singer Joe Lesté formed the group adding former Shake The Faith bassist Kenny Kweens along with session drummer Anthony Focx. Focx eventually became the group's second guitarist with Glen Sobel, another session drummer, being brought in to replace him. This would be the first lineup under the moniker Beautiful Creatures. Prior to naming, the band opened one show in Houston, Texas, for Kiss during their reunion tour after Ted Nugent pulled out, performing with the name Hellstar. The band were given two more support slots in Detroit and East Lansing then entered the studio to record material for their debut album. The band were then signed to Warner Bros. and released self-titled debut Beautiful Creatures, produced by Marilyn Manson cohort Sean Beavan, on August 14, 2001. The album charted at number 38 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers while the single "Wasted" peaked at number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Chart. The band were added to the 2001 Ozzfest lineup playing from June 8 through to August 12 as well as the Rolling Rock Tour and later toured Japan. Album track 1 A.M. was featured in the soundtrack for the 2001 horror film Valentine and TV series Smallville. Ride was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 remake of Rollerball. After the merger between Time Warner and AOL earlier in the year the band were eventually dropped after shake ups at the record label and abysmal record sales. By the end of 2001, the album had sold 25,490 copies.

Ashba and Sobel depart (2002) 
On February 13, 2002, the band announced that Beautiful Creatures founder Dj ASHBA had left the group but that the band would find a replacement and continue on. Ashba released a statement showing that he left the band on good terms and that fans should welcome "the new addition to the band with open arms." Little over a month later, guitarist Michael Thomas had left to join Beautiful Creatures as the replacement to the recently departed Ashba. However, Thomas left the band in April 2003 to tour with Suki Jones (the first incarnation of Adler's Appetite) as a temporary replacement for Brent Muscat who was touring with Faster Pussycat. Thomas then joined former BC guitarist DJ Ashba's solo band simply titled ASHBA. Drummer Glen Sobel also departed the group and joined the backing band of singer/rapper Brooks Buford along with former members of Killgore and members of Hate Machine, Omniblank, Rehab and Tommy Lee's solo band.

Deuce (2003–2006) 
Despite the losses the band regrouped adding lead guitarist Alex Grossi and drummer Matt Starr and began recording material for the follow-up to their self-titled debut. Produced and mixed by guitarist Anthony Focx, with additional by bass guitar Kenny Kweens, the band were to release second album Deuce on Japanese label JVC in 2004 with a US release due in early 2005 but the album was not released until April 21, 2005, in Japan and after signing with Spitfire Records
 the album was released in the US on August 23, 2005. By this point, guitarist Grossi had departed the band to join the new lineup of Quiet Riot and was replaced by Michael Thomas briefly and then by former Flotsam and Jetsam guitarist Mark Simpson. Drummer Starr was also replaced by Bang Tango drummer Timmy Russell. To support the album, that band announced a fall tour with industrial metal band The Genitorturers.
 After signing a deal with Perris Records for a European release of Deuce in 2006, the band embarked on a UK headlining tour with Stephen Pearcy of Ratt.

Bang Tango bassist Lance Eric has filled in for gigs on Bass as well.

On Nov 25, Joe Lesté collapsed on stage during a Bang Tango show in Chicago, Illinois. This prompted numerous online rumours that the singer was "on his deathbed" but these were soon quashed by guitarist Alex Grossi:

Grossi then issued another update on Lesté's condition:
