Name

The community is named for Mount Signal, a summit about  southwest, inside Mexico.  It is also known as El Cerro Centinela, by the Mexicans, and Wi'Shspa, by the Kwapa: Cocopah people.

Mount Signal was used by the early Pioneers and Native Americans as a landmark to help guide them through the desert. Most of the fields in the area are currently growing alfalfa or sugar beets.

Mount Signal Road takes you to the mountain and the International Border. Unfortunately, there is not a Port of Entry there. However, there is a limited access area for off-road vehicles.

Even though Mount Signal appears to be in the United States, it is actually located on the Mexican side of the border. If one would like to climb all  to the top, one must do so from the Mexican side. Climbers need to take care, there are no maintained trails. During the 1870s U.S. engineers climbed the mountain to record the elevation, so there should be a monument marker at the top.

History
A post office operated at Mount Signal from 1916 to 1934.
