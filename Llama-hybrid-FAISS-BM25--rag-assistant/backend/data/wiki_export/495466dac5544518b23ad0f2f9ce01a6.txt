History 
Begun as a two-story, 14-room facility on Wilson Lane in 1926, B-CC High School opened at its current location on East-West Highway in 1935 at  in a building designed by Howard Wright Cutler. 

From 1946 to 1950, the B-CC building was used as the first home of Montgomery Junior College—today's Montgomery College, the county's public community college. During its first school year, the college had about 175 students.

Over the years, new buildings were erected and existing buildings enlarged, including:
 1936:  
 1950: 
 1952: 
 1959: 
 1966: 
 1970: 
 1975: 
 1976:  

These additions brought the total school area to .

In the summer of 1994, parents, teachers, administrators, business people and other supporters of B-CC High School formed the Community Coalition for Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. Its charge was to re-engineer and refocus the high school in an increasingly urbanized and cosmopolitan area. CC-B-CC representatives were encouraged to think broadly and innovatively to create programs that would lead B-CC High School and Montgomery County Public Schools into the next century.

Because of this effort, in February 2002, B-CC High School re-opened its doors after a two-and-a-half year, multimillion-dollar, comprehensive modernization that, among other things, combined the historic 1935 and 1936 structures into one building. It had a  addition,  of renovations of the original 1935, 1936 and part of the 1950 buildings, and  of demolitions of most of the 1950 building, 1952, 1959, 1966, 1970, 1975, and 1976 buildings. The building now encompasses .
