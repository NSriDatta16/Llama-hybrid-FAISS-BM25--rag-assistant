Career 
Her debut work was the short story "Sankakukei no dessert", published in Monthly LaLa in November 1984. 
Several of her works were serialized in the josei magazines Feel Young (published by Shodensha) and the now defunct Young You.

In the 2010s, she started publishing in the seinen manga magazine Comic Beam. Her manga Onnanoko ga Iru Basho wa, released in the magazine between 2021 and 2022, is nominated for the 2023 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.
