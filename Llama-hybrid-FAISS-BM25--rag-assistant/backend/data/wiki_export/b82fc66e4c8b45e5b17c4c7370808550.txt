Pinoy Big Brother
Gretchen left the house after Big Brother allowed Gretchen to report to her superiors in the Philippine Air Force (where she serves as a first-class airwoman) to face a summary investigation about her being AWOL. Big Brother did this with the proviso that she will be blindfolded during the trip and that she cannot speak to anyone except those who were investigating her.

Then she was later evicted on Day 39.
