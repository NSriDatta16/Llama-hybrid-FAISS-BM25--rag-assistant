History and culture

Early history

Some of the first Polynesian navigators to New Zealand landed at Matauri Bay. It was a site of early Māori contact with Europeans, such as with the missionary Samuel Marsden in 1814.

Rainbow Warrior

The Rainbow Warrior was given a final resting place near Matauri Bay, at the Cavalli Islands. It has become a living reef, attracting marine life and recreational divers.

The idea was first proposed by the New Zealand Underwater Association. It seemed a fitting end for a ship that had spent its time protecting the marine environment.

It was towed north with a patched hull on 2 December 1987. Ten days later, a crowd of well-wishers looked on as it was given a traditional Māori burial. Now home to a complex ecosystem, the Rainbow Warrior has become a popular dive destination. The local Māori community maintains its guardianship and conservation. In a few years, the Rainbow Warrior became an integral part of the environment it helped protect.

Marae

The Matauri Bay area has two marae. Mātauri or Te Tāpui Marae and Ngāpuhi meeting house is a meeting place of the Ngāpuhi hapū of Ngāti Kura and Ngāti Miru, and the Ngāpuhi / Ngāti Kahu ki Whaingaroa hapū of Ngāti Kura. Te Ngaere Marae and Ngāi Tupango te Hapū meeting house is a meeting place of the Ngāpuhi / Ngāti Kahu ki Whaingaroa hapū of Ngaitupango.
