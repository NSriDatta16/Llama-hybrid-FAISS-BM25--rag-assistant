The American Dream is Emitt Rhodes' first album. It was recorded from 1967 to 1969, but released in 1970 as a contractual obligation to A&M Records. The album was reissued in 1971 in response to the success of his self-titled debut album on Dunhill Records.

The original issue was a non-commercially released version pressed in late November of 1970 with picture-frame cover and "Saturday Night" – 1:59. A&M quickly withdrew this "frame cover" after approximately 1000 copies had been pressed. Deciding that the album did not have enough "hit potential," A&M chose a song from Rhodes' previous band The Merry-Go-Round, "You're A Very Lovely Woman," to replace "Saturday Night," which can only be found on this release.

The album was then reissued in March of 1971 with the paint-splatter cover image and the replacement song found on all subsequent releases.

"Saturday Night" does appear on Listen, Listen — the Definitive Collection of The Merry-Go-Round and The Emitt Rhodes Recordings (1969–1973).
