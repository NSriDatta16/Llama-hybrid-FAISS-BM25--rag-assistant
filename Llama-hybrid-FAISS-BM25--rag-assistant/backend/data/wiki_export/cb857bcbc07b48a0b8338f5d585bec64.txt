Change of Heart is a 1978 album by Eric Carmen. It was his third solo LP, and reached No. 137 on the Billboard album chart.

The album yielded two charting singles, the title track which was a Top 20 hit in North America, as well as Carmen's remake of the Four Tops' 1964 song, "Baby I Need Your Loving".  
Both songs were also hits on the American and Canadian adult contemporary charts, reaching the Top 10 in Canada.
The single release, "Change of Heart" is ranked as the 135th biggest Canadian hit of 1978, as well as the 160th biggest Canadian hit of 1979.

The LP also contained Carmen's rendition of "Hey Deanie," a Top 10 hit which he wrote for Shaun Cassidy, which was the flip side of the title track 45 RPM.

Samantha Sang, who provides backing vocals on the LP, covered "Change of Heart" that same year, and it was featured as the B side of her second hit single, "You Keep Me Dancing" (US No. 56, Canada AC No. 10).

"Someday," the flip side of Carmen's previous hit, "She Did It," was omitted from Boats Against the Current but was included on this album.  "Someday" was also included as the B side of the European release of "Haven't We Come a Long Way," a third single from the LP released in UK and the Netherlands but which failed to chart.  The North American release featured "End of the World" as the B side.

The title song also reached number seven in France. It was included on a 2005 album entitled, Nichehits, a compilation of songs by various artists.  The album was issued by Victor Records.

In 2017, Change of Heart was released in Japan for the sixth time.
