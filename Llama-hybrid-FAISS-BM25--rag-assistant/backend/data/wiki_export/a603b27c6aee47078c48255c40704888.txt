This is a listing of characters from the Swallows and Amazons series of books by Arthur Ransome.

The Swallows
John Walker — eldest of the Walker children and Captain of the Swallow
Susan Walker — Mate of the Swallow and the cook and domestic organizer
Titty Walker — Able Seaman of the Swallow and the most imaginative of the Walkers. This name was the nickname of the real life Mavis Altounyan, taken from Joseph Jacobs's children's story Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse.  It has caused titters among generations of children since, causing it to be changed to Kitty in the original 1963 television series of Swallows and Amazons, and Tatty for a 2016 BBC Films adaptation (but in the 1974 BBC adaptation she was Titty). 
Roger Walker — initially Ship's Boy, later Able Seaman (and Ship's Engineer in Great Northern?), mischievous, mechanical and very fond of chocolate. He is the second-youngest of the children.

These latter form the main ingredients for the stew cooked by Dorothea the night before the burglary, when Nancy visits the Dogs Home at night in a rainstorm and shares the rabbit stew.  Jacky is pleased to have his knife with a bone handle, which the Ds find in the Dogs Home and return to him.

Unfriendly Natives

Jim and Molly address her as "Aunt Maria" and she held considerable sway as head of the family, even after Molly's marriage to Bob Blackett. As a parent figure to their mother, Great Aunt Maria clearly thought of herself as something of a grandmother-figure to her great-nieces Nancy and Peggy Blackett. However, their view of her as some sort of distant relative, as well as an overprotective adventure-spoiler, forms the basis of the conflict between the girls and her. Of the twelve completed books in the series, she makes appearances in two, Swallowdale and The Picts and the Martyrs.
George Owdon – a Norfolk boy, older than Tom Dudgeon, in Coot Club and The Big Six. He steals and sells birds' eggs, so is an enemy of the Coots.

Last seen in gaudy but wet yachting gear and beach pyjamas being escorted to an hotel in Yarmouth having rammed a post on Breydon Water. They are called Ronald, James and 'Livy' (Olivia?), plus an unnamed man and unnamed woman (called Jerry and Maude in the TV series Swallows and Amazons Forever). 
Mr Jemmerling – an egg collector and owner of the Pterodactyl in Great Northern?  
The Dogmudgeon – Scottish head ghillie and one of the Gaels who at first stalk the explorers in Great Northern? but later assists them against Mr Jemmerling.

Bill describes them: Simeon Boon just out from two years hard, Mogandy the negro, George (a brother of Black Jake, who is wanted by the police), and a man with a scarred face who was chucker-out or bruiser at the Ketch as Ketch Can (a fisherman's tavern in Lowestoft). Later when they climb onto the Wild Cat and attack Bill and Peter Duck, it is apparent that the others do not trust Black Jake, and that Black Jake's brother is called George (see Peter Duck, chapters 1, 13 & 30).
