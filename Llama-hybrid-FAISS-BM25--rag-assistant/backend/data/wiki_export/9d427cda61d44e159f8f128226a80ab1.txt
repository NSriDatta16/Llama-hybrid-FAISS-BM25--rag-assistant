The Menands Bridge, officially known as the Troy-Menands Bridge, is a four-span through truss bridge that carries New York State Route 378 across the Hudson River in New York connecting Menands with Troy. Built in 1933, the crossing is supported by concrete piers and - even though it was designed and constructed at the end of the first third of the 20th century - was originally fitted with a lift section to accommodate tall ships.

The section's lifting device was removed in 1966, but the elevating towers remained until their removal in the summer of 2000.

Today the bridge has a clearance over the water of , and a horizontal clearance between spans of . In addition, NYSDOT is planning to replace this bridge within the next 10 years.
