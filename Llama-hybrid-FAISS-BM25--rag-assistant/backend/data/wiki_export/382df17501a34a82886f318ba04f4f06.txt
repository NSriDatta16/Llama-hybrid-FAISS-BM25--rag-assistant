The Volvo ÖV 4 was the first car built by Volvo. The designation ÖV 4 stands for "Öppen Vagn 4 cylindrar" in Swedish, which means Open Carriage, 4 cylinders. The model ÖV 4 has later often been referred to as "Jakob" but that was just a name for one of the 10 pre-series ÖV 4 that was ready on 25 July 1926, Jakob's name day. All 10 prototypes were assembled in Stockholm at the company AB Galco, Hälsingegatan 41 where Gustaf Larson worked at that time. Only one of the 10 pre-series cars manufactured during 1926 was saved for posterity and is housed at the Volvo Museum in Gothenburg, Sweden.

History

The engine was designed by Gustav Larson and its main chassis components by Jan G. Smith, a designer who had worked many years in the American automobile industry and returned to Sweden in 1924. Many of Jan G. Smith's original drawings for the ÖV4 and other technical papers that he collected in America are saved in the archive of the National Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

When the first series produced ÖV4 was about to drive out of the factory and engineer Eric Carlberg put it into first gear, the car went backwards, where the car was actually in reverse gear. The explanation was that the differential gear in the rear axle had been fitted incorrectly. This mistake delayed the introduction by one day and the official introduction day for the ÖV4 was then adjusted to 14 April 1927, the day AB Volvo officially says the automobile company Volvo was "born"— this is from a marketing point of view. The company as an automobile company was born as a subsidiary company to SKF on 10 August 1926.

Models

The cabriolet was not very successful in the Swedish climate; the covered version, PV 4, was introduced in the summer of 1927. This had a Weymann body and the original design was rather ungainly. Helmer MasOlle, who had been inspired by his personal Voisin C5 when he designed the original ÖV 4, was reportedly furious about the PV 4 and would not be associated with it. By 1928 a more balanced design was introduced, with a longer bonnet and thinner pillars. The oval rear window of the original PV 4 was gradually replaced by a rectangular unit.

Between 1927 and 1929 a total of 996 cars were manufactured. Of these 694 were PV 4 and 302 ÖV 4. 251 of the covered cars were of the "PV 4 Special" model. The ÖV 4 production includes 27 naked chassis and 70 small pickup trucks (ÖV 4 TV) developed for Telegrafverket, the royal telecommunications company. Some of these light trucks were sold to other customers. The TV model has a small convertible top mounted just behind the front seats, with a cargo area behind.
