The Taylorâ€“Southgate Bridge is a continuous truss bridge that was built in 1995. It has a main span of , and a total span of . The bridge carries U.S. Route 27 across the Ohio River, connecting Newport, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio.

Some regard this bridge, which was a replacement for the Cincinnati-Newport Bridge built by Samuel Bigstaff, as a little too plain in its design for a major urban bridge, especially considering many cities today are opting for a more elegant design, such as a cable stayed bridge.

The bridge is named for the families of James Taylor, Jr. and Richard Southgate, two important early settlers of Newport. Richard was the father of William Wright Southgate, a pre Civil War Congressman from northern Kentucky.

The bridge replaced the Cincinnati-Newport Bridge, a truss bridge built in 1890. Commonly known as Central Bridge, it was demolished in 1992.
