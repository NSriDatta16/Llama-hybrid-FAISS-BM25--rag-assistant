The sphenopalatine foramen is a fissure of the skull that connects the nasal cavity and the pterygopalatine fossa. It gives passage to the sphenopalatine artery, nasopalatine nerve, and the superior nasal nerve (all passing from the pterygopalatine fossa into the nasal cavity).

Structure
The processes of the superior border of the palatine bone are separated by the sphenopalatine notch, which is converted into the sphenopalatine foramen by the under surface of the body of the sphenoid.

The sphenopalatine foramen is situated posterior to the middle nasal meatus orbital process of palatine bone, anterior to the sphenoidal process of palatine bone, inferior to the body and  of the sphenoid bone, and superior to the superior margin of the perpendicular plate of palatine bone.

Relations 
The ethmoid crest (a reliable surgical landmark) is situated anterior to the sphenopalatine foramen.
