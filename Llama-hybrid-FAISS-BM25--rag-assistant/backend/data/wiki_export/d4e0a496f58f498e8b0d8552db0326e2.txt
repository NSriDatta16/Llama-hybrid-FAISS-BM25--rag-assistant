It is the first track and first single from the soundtrack album Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George, which was released in February 2006 (same month as theaters). A remix edition featuring Money Mark was released as a bonus track on some versions of Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George.

The song peaked at number 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was Johnson's only US top-40 hit until "You and Your Heart" in 2010. Released as a single in the UK on May 22, 2006, it debuted at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart the day before its physical release via download sales alone.

The music video begins with Johnson walking along a pier carrying a guitar as Curious George watches from a tree. Johnson then slips on a banana peel and falls into the ocean. He is then shown in place of the Man with the Yellow Hat in several scenes from the film. The video was directed by prolific music video directors the Malloys.
