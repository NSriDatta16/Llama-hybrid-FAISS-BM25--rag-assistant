Future burials
Los Angeles National Cemetery has been closed to new interments since approximately 1978, with the exception of spouses of those already buried. To accommodate community need,  the Department of Veterans Affairs acquired another  to permit the cemetery to expand. Future interments will be in urns of cremated ashes placed in columbarium walls built on the new land.  By eliminating ground burials, the new acreage will permit about as many new interments as are in the existing .

In 2017, Los Angeles National Cemetery began construction on the first phase of the columbarium on Constitution Avenue, west of I-405 just  from the main cemetery entrance. This phase opened in October 2019 and occupies approximately  of the site and holds 10,000 niches for cremated remains.  The cemetery will construct additional niches on the site as needed until it reaches the planned capacity of 90,854.
