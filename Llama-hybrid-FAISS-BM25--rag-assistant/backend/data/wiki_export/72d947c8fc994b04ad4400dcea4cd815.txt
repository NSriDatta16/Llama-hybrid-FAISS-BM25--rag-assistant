As a result of this he signed with AmaZulu, rising through the reserve ranks to being a member of the league championship winning squad.

Nyandoro was then signed by South African club Mamelodi Sundowns in 2004 and was named the PSL Club Rookie of the Year after his debut season.

In the summer of 2006, Nyandoro joined up with English Premier League club Sheffield United for a trial. This was on the recommendation of Peter Ndlovu who had played for the club. Nyandoro was however not signed.
