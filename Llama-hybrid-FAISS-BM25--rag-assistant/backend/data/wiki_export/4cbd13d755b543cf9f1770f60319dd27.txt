Southwestern Educational Society ("SESO")  is a private, English language school in Mayagüez, a western municipality in Puerto Rico that was founded in 1973.

History

In 1972 it was announced that the English speaking campus at the Inter-American University in San Germán would close the following year. An international group of concerned parents started planning a new school.
