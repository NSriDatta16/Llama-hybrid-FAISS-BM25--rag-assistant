History
Mõisaküla arose on the fens of Abja manor (mõis), after which it is named. It was a large railway hub in the 1920s and 1930s, when two narrow-gauge lines came through Mõisaküla, serving all of Estonia until the 1970s when the Soviets closed both lines. It became a town on 1 May 1938.

A Lutheran church was established in 1934, but was burned and destroyed in 1983; restoration of the church started in 2005 and the church reopened in 2014.
