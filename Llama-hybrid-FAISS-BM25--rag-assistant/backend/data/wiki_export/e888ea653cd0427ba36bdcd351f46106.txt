is a Japanese actress and narrator. She works for Aoni Production. She is most known for originating the roles of Fujiko Mine (Lupin III), Honey Kisaragi (Cutie Honey), and Bakabon's Mama (Tensai Bakabon).

Early life
Eiko Masuyama was the youngest of four sisters. When she was young she spoke slowly. Her teacher told her "You can't talk properly". At age 12, she joined the Children's Theater Company to improve her speech. She studied under Miyoko Asō, overcoming the complex. She later became interested in acting.

Career 
When Masuyama was too old for the children's company, Sanno theatrical company was launched by actors Sandayū Dokumamushi and Yasushi Inayoshi.

She became a member of Aoni Production in the 1960s. She began to focus on voice acting because of its scheduling flexibility, to balance childcare and work.

In 2017, she was awarded the “Anime Outreach Category” at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival 2017.

She focuses on narration, but in anime works she sometimes replays the voices of earlier characters.

In 2021, she won the "Merit Award" at the 15th Seiyu Awards.
