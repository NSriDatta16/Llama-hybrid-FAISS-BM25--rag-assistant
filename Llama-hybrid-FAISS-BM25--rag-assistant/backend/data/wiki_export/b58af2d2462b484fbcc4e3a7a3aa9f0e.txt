Christopher Edward Speier (born June 28, 1950) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop, most notably for the San Francisco Giants and the Montreal Expos. He is known by the nickname "the Alameda Rifle" as a native of the San Francisco Bay Area city who possessed a strong arm during his days as an active player.

Playing career
Speier was drafted by the Giants as the second overall pick in the first round of 1970 Major League Baseball draft. Speier played 19 seasons in the Major Leagues as a shortstop for the Montreal Expos, San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs and briefly for the St. Louis Cardinals and Minnesota Twins during the 1984 season. In an exchange of starting shortstops, he was traded from the Giants to the Expos for Tim Foli on April 26, 1977.

Speier accrued a career .246 batting average and a .970 fielding percentage at shortstop. His overall playing strengths were his solid fielding and selective eye at the plate. He was also named to the National League All-Star team during the 1972, 1973 and 1974 seasons as a member of the Giants. Speier won the 1987 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership during his second time with the Giants.

He hit for the cycle  twice in his major league career, on July 20, 1978, as a member of the Montreal Expos in a 7-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves at Montreal and nearly 10 years later on July 9, 1988, as a member of the San Francisco Giants in a 21-2 rout of the St. Louis Cardinals at Candlestick Park.
