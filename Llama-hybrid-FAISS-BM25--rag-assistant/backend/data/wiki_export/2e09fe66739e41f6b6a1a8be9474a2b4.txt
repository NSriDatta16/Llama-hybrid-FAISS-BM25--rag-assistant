The Juice Box is a low-cost multimedia player made by toy manufacturer Mattel. The player features a  screen with a native resolution of 240×160 px and runs μClinux, a microcontroller version of the Linux kernel. It was made and released in November 2004, and was discontinued in early 2005. It has 66 MHz ARM7TDMI architecture Samsung processor S3C44B0, 2 MBytes or 8 MBytes of RAM and 8MB of ROM. It was marketed as a portable media player for children (like its competitors VideoNow and Game Boy Advance Video). The player only played a proprietary cartridge format. 4Kids Entertainment and Cartoon Network put some of their shows on cartridges. However, the small screen and poor quality (10 frames per second maximum) alienated most people. Furthermore, the device entered a crowded market. Its rivals are the VideoNow and the Game Boy Advance, the GBA being the most potent. The difference is that GBA not only had TV shows (which can be played through Game Boy Advance Video cartridges), but could also play video games, as it was built for that. Thus many retail stores were left with a surplus of the device. Original retail price was about US$70.
