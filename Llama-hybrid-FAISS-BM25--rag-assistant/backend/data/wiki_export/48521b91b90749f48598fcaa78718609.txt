History 
Muskego High School was constructed in 1956 at the corner of Woods Road and Racine Ave. Its first elected administrator, Arnold Wicklund, oversaw the school's construction. Prior to the school's construction, many Muskego children attended school in the Milwaukee School District.

In September 2003 the high school was completely remodeled, with  added to the building. Facilities that were added include several wings and a performing arts center. A controversial portion of the remodel was the addition of eight 42" flat screen TVs for the cafeteria, and the incorrect placement of the supporting wall of the South Gym, which prevents the bleachers from being able to be pulled out entirely during sporting events. The campus also expanded, with approximately  of new athletic fields and green space.

In April 2016, a referendum was passed to add a new artificial turf field to the nearby, district owned stadium, Inpro Field. Along with this referendum, a new set of bleachers and press box were added to the West side of Inpro Field. On the south side of Inpro Field there was a concession stand added with restrooms and the ticket booths. Most of the field was made possible by the Inpro Corporation, with donations from the Muskego Grid Iron Club (booster club) and fundraising in the community of Muskego.
