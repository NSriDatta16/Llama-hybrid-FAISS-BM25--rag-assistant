History 
One of the older parishes in the municipality, it was founded in 1485 by King John II. The area was constituted to serve an economic and defensive role in the Alentejo, at the confluence of the Mira River, and benefited from its strategic importance as a safe harbor. The first inhabitants were prisoners sentenced by minor crimes; 50 years later the population of the parish was little more than ten families.

The village was frequently attacked by pirates and was destroyed completely in 1590. In response, Fort São Clemente was constructed between 1599 and 1602 under the reign of King PhilipII during the personal union of Spain and Portugal.

During the 19th century, the parish was integrated into the municipality of Odemira, during the administrative reforms of Mouzinho da Silveira.

On 7 April 1924, pilots José Manuel Sarmento de Beires and :pt: António Jacinto da Silva Brito Pais left Campo dos Coitos, near Milfontes on their voyage to the Far East. In homage to the aviators and their historic flight, in the Barbacã Square (alongside the fort), a monument was erected to mark their voyage.
