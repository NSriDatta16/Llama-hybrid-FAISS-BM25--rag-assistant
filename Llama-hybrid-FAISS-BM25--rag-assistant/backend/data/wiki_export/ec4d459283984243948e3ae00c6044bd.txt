Eighteen, Twenty-Nine (; also known as 18 vs. 29) is a 2005 South Korean television series starring Park Sun-young and Ryu Soo-young. Based on the Internet novel The 4321 Days We Shared, the romantic comedy series aired on KBS2 from March 7 to April 26, 2005 on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes.

Plot 
Yoo Hye-chan (Park Sun-young) is a 29-year-old housewife who's unhappily married to a top acting star, Kang Sang-young (Ryu Soo-young). While on her way to court to file for divorce, a car accident drastically changes her life. Though she physically recovers, retrograde amnesia causes Hye-chan to mentally revert to that of an 18-year-old girl, and she finds everything around her unfamiliar.

In high school in the 1990s, Hye-chan considered Kang Bong-man, the most popular boy at school and nicknamed "Ice Prince," as her nemesis. Though seemingly shallow and callous, Bong-man hides his vulnerability due to his infamous family background. But little did Hye-chan know that her despised and hated classmate would become an actor one day, change his name to Kang Sang-young and become her future husband. For Sang-young, seeing his wife reliving their high school days rekindles their lost love, and he strives to mend their shattered marriage and help her recover her memory. Meanwhile, Hye-chan begins to fall for him all over again. The only obstacle is Shin Ji-young (Park Eun-hye), an actress who wants Sang-young for herself.
