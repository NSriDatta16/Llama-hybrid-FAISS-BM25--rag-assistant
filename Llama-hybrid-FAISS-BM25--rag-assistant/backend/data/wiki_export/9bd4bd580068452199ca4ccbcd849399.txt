Documentation
The Bahing language was described by Brian Houghton Hodgson (1857, 1858) as having a very complex verbal morphology. By the 1970s, only vestiges were left, making Bahing a case study of grammatical attrition and language death.

Phonology
Bahing and the related Khaling language have synchronic ten-vowel systems. The difference of  "monkey" vs.  "human being" is difficult to perceive for speakers of even neighboring dialects, which makes for "an unlimited source of fun to the Bahing people" (de Boer 2002 PDF).

Morphology
Hodgson (1857) reported a middle voice formed by a suffix -s(i) added  to the verbal stem, corresponding to reflexives in other Kiranti languages.
