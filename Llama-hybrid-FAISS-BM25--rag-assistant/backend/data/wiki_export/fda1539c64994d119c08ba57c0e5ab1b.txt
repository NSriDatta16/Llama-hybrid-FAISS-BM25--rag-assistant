Eastern Shore is a provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.

In 1967, the district was created as Halifax Eastern Shore out of Halifax East and part of Halifax County Dartmouth. Upon the recommendations of the 1992 Electoral Boundaries Commission report, the district name was changed to Eastern Shore and it gained the Upper Lawrencetown area from Cole Harbour. In 2003, it gained an area on its western boundary from Dartmouth-Cole Harbour and lost an area on its eastern boundary to Guysborough-Sheet Harbour. In 2013, the district lost the Ross Road area to Preston-Dartmouth.

It is known as a bellwether district, having elected a government representative in every election since 1970.
