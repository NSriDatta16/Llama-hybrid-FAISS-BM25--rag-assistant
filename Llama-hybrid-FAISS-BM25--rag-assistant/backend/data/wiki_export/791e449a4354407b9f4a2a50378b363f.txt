Doc Hudson (also known as The Fabulous Hudson Hornet, Hud, or simply Doc) is an anthropomorphic 1951 Hudson Hornet who appears in the 2006 Pixar film Cars. In the film, Doc is the medical doctor and local judge for Radiator Springs. After meeting Lightning McQueen, Doc reveals that he is actually a former Piston Cup racer known as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, and returns to the Piston Cup to act as Lightning's crew chief in his races. It is implied that Doc died before the events of Cars 2, and in Cars 3 he appears in flashback sequences.

Doc is voiced by Paul Newman in Cars, Cars 3 (the latter via archive audio recordings) and Cars: the Video Game, and Corey Burton in all other media. Six-time Turismo Carretera champion Juan Mar√≠a Traverso voiced the character in the Rioplatense Spanish version of the first film.

Doc Hudson is based on the real-life Fabulous Hudson Hornet of NASCAR. He generally maintains the same image in all three films with navy-blue paint and light modifications for racing. Doc's racing number is 51, a reference to his model year.

Character
Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman in his last non-documentary film role and in his only animated film role) was Radiator Springs' local physician. His license plate read 51HHMD, which was a reference to his year and track number (51), model (Hudson Hornet) and profession (medical doctor). A racer turned mechanic, Doc Hudson had Newman's blue eyes.

Doc's stickers read "Twin H Power", which was an optional dealer-installed dual carburetor intake manifold, with twin 1-barrel carburetors and air filters. It was a dealer-installed option in 1951 and then a factory option for 1952 model year Hornets.

Background 

Many years before the events of Cars, Doc Hudson was known as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet. He won three consecutive Piston Cups (1951/1952/1953) and still held the record for most wins in a single season (27, also the number of NASCAR Grand National races won by Hudson Hornets in 1952.) His career unexpectedly came to an end when he suffered a rollover crash during the final lap of the 1954 Fireball Beach 350, a story which closely parallels the fate of Herb Thomas, NASCAR's 1951 and 1953 champion. Upon his return, Doc discovered that racing had moved on without him, as he had been replaced by a new car. He kept a newspaper article on the career-ending crash as a reminder to never return to racing.

Jaded by the racing scene, Doc left that world, apparently taking out time to study law and medicine. Hudson then disappeared into obscurity, leaving many wondering where he went. He removed his racing modifications and took on the life of a judge and physician in the town of Radiator Springs on U.S. Route 66. He ran a medical office as a "doctor of internal combustion". As times changed and the town got bypassed by Interstate 40, Doc stayed on, even when the population dwindled to a meager dozen residents. Nobody in the town had any idea of his past as a racer, knowing him merely as an ordinary Hudson Hornet.

Appearances

Cars (2006) 
Upon meeting Lightning McQueen in court, Doc saw far too much of the past that he had left behind. He quickly tried to dismiss the case and send Lightning away, but was convinced to sentence him to community service by having him repave the road as punishment. After Lightning failed to repave the road correctly, Doc challenged him to a race, in which Lightning lost by understeering and hitting cacti due to him not knowing how to corner on an unbanked turn. Doc's one token attempt to explain drifting to Lightning was met with misunderstanding and skepticism, leaving Doc disillusioned and bitter about the young, selfish racecar.

He was less than happy when Lightning discovered his secret and asked, "How could a car like you quit at the top of your game?" Doc bitterly revealed that he did not quit, but was forced into retirement after his crash by the rise of newer, faster cars. After Lightning finished repaving the road, he decided to stay in town for an extra day, but Doc was unable to bear having him around any longer and called the Piston Cup authorities, forcing Lightning to immediately leave for the tie-breaker race in California. After being scolded by Sally for making Lightning leave out of his dislike of him, Doc realizes that Lightning had become more important to the town than he thought. He believed the townsfolk would be happier without Lightning, but was quickly proven wrong.

Realizing that he couldn't keep his past hidden anymore, he not only admitted to the townsfolk that he was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, but took back his racing modifications to become Lightning's crew chief.  At the race, the commentators recognized his presence on the cameras and Doc finally received a long-overdue acknowledgment for his return. During the final lap of the race, Lightning used what he learned from Doc to gain the lead. When Lightning chose to help The King finish his last race instead of winning the Piston Cup, Doc realized that Lightning's personality had finally changed for the better.

At the end of the film, Doc kept his racing colors, becoming a trainer, mentor, and friend to Lightning McQueen. Together, Lightning and Doc won four consecutive Piston Cups.

Cars: the Video Game (2006) 
In Cars: the Video Game, Doc taught Lightning powerslide lessons and became crew chief for Lightning during the Piston Cup season in the game's story mode. He is also a playable character who can be purchased for 5,000 points. Though during the game's story mode he wore his original blue paint job and whitewall tires when racing Lightning or training him, his original racing colors can be purchased for use in arcade mode.

Cars 2 (2011) 
In Cars 2, Doc died before the events of the film (his voice actor, Paul Newman, died in 2008) and the Piston Cup was renamed in his honor, with his clinic being converted into a museum that displayed trophies and mementos from his career.

Cars 3 (2017) 

John Lasseter announced that Cars 3 would include a tribute to Doc Hudson. Lightning's crash in the teaser was a reference to Doc's accident, and he often recalled pieces of advice that Doc gave him in flashbacks. Lightning went to Doc's old crew chief, a Hudson Super Six pick-up named Smokey in Thomasville, Georgia, for help and watched old recordings of Doc's races for inspiration. Smokey explained to Lightning that mentoring him, not racing, was the best part of Doc's life. At the end, Lightning adopted Doc Hudson's old racing colors and painted "The Fabulous Lightning McQueen" on himself in honor of Doc. Lightning's bumper also read, "For Doc Hudson". Cruz Ramirez, Lightning's former trainer who subsequently started a racing career of her own, took on Doc's racing number as a second tribute.

Inspiration

The car is based on the real-life Fabulous Hudson Hornet in NASCAR competition, with Hudson's racing career most closely resembling that of Herb Thomas, the record holder for highest career win rate (55 of 228 races, or 21.05%), and the first ever two-time champion.

Paul Newman, a racing enthusiast and former driver, drew upon his experiences for the grumpy old race car's personality. The character has strong parallels to Dr. Aurelius Hogue from the 1991 film Doc Hollywood and shares the "Doc" moniker with the late Walter "Doc" Mason, interviewed on Route 66 as research for the film.

A close friend of Michael Wallis (the voice of Sheriff), country veterinarian Dr. Walter S. Mason Jr. owned the Tradewinds Courtyard Inn from 1963 until 2003 and donated land for the Oklahoma Route 66 Museum in Clinton. Doc Mason died in June 2007 after a long illness with Alzheimer's disease. After his demise the inn, which once hosted Elvis Presley went into a steep decline, losing its Best Western membership and receiving many highly-negative reviews.

The original Hudson Hornet was manufactured until 1954. Built around a 5.0L, 6 cylinder inline engine with (starting in 1952) twin carburetors on a very low body and centre of gravity, the Hornet was essentially a racing car with the veneer of a luxury sedan.  Fabulous Hudson Hornets won NASCAR cups for three consecutive years (Herb Thomas in 1951 and 1953, and Tim Flock in 1952), paralleling Doc Hudson's three Piston Cup wins in those same years. The Hudson Motor Company was merged into Nash Motors on January 14, 1954, to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). After brief use as a marque on Nash-designed AMC vehicles, the Hudson name was discontinued after the 1957 model year. The automaker particitated in a variety of motor sport venues that included five NASCAR wins with its AMC Matador between 1973 and 1975. Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.

The "Fabulous Hudson Hornet" name, which appeared on three famous NASCAR entries between 1951 and 1954, vanished once Hudson was merged into AMC. Herb Thomas #92 raced Buick and Chevrolet cars in 1955; severe injuries in a 1956 racing wreck in Shelby effectively ended his career, despite two unsuccessful starts in 1957 and one in 1962. Tim Flock #91 switched to Ford cars in 1955; he was one of two drivers forced out of NASCAR after supporting a 1961 unionisation attempt, the Federation of Professional Athletes. Marshall Teague #6 left NASCAR after the 1952 season in a dispute with NASCAR's owner Bill France, Sr.; he was killed in a  rollover collision at Daytona on 11 February 1959.

Herb Thomas' 1952 Fabulous Hudson Hornet is currently displayed in the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum in Michigan; Tim Flock's car is in the Memory Lane Museum in Mooresville, North Carolina. Herb Thomas entered NASCAR's hall of fame for 2013 as the first to win two NASCAR premier series championships (1951 and 1953). A replica of Teague's car is owned by Bruce and Patty Teeters (Teague's descendants).
