Henriksenia nepenthicola, synonym Misumenops nepenthicola, is a species of crab spider. It is native to Singapore. It lives inside the pitchers of a number of lowland Nepenthes pitcher plants. As such, it is classified as a nepenthephile. They are slow-moving spiders which do not actively hunt.  Males and females both reach a length of 6 mm.

Taxonomy
The species was first described by Jean-Louis Fage in 1928 as Misumenops nepenthicola. It was transferred to the genus Henriksenia in 2009. A complication is that in 1930, W. S. Bristowe used the name Misumenops nepenthicola for a different species. An application to preserve Bristowe's name over Fage's was rejected in 2007, and in 2009, Henriksenia labuanica was published as a replacement name for Bristowe's name.

In 2006, Pekka T. Lehtinen wrote that the name "Misumenops nepenthicola" had been used for at least five different species, possibly because of a mistaken belief that there was only one species of spider belonging to the tribe Misumenini living in Nepenthes pitchers.
