Carly Corinthos is a fictional character from General Hospital, a soap opera on the ABC network, portrayed by Laura Wright from 2005. A collaborative effort between the writers, Carly – originally played by Sarah Joy Brown from 1996 to 2001 — was introduced under executive producer Wendy Riche. A "love to hate" character who brings excitement to storylines because of her devious ways, Carly is the illegitimate daughter of former bad girl turned heroine, Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman).

Carly seduces her mother's husband for revenge. Throughout the 2000s, Carly, then Tamara Braun from 2001 to 2005, goes on to become one of the show's most prominent, vital and popular characters largely due to her supercouple pairing with mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and her friendship with Jason Morgan (Steve Burton). Carly's revenge on Bobbie and her near lethal vendetta against A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) — the biological father of her son Michael (Chad Duell) – remains two of the most revered and controversial plots in the show's history.

While Brown's portrayal of Carly is viewed as a "duplicitous vixen," Braun's Carly is viewed as more of a romantic heroine. With Laura Wright in the role, Carly goes from being a pampered wife to being powerful business woman while embodying the qualities of her predecessors. Sarah Brown earned three Daytime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Carly—two in the Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series category and one in Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category. Braun earned an Emmy nomination Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2004. The role of Carly would bring Laura Wright her first Emmy nomination overall – in the Outstanding Lead Actress and her first win, 20 years after breaking into daytime television on ABC's Loving.

Creation

Casting
Brown, known for her appearance in the children's series VR Troopers, auditioned for the role of Carly in early 1996 opposite Burton, who played Jason. Brown won the role out of seven other actresses including Burton's real-life girlfriend. Despite her own reservations, Brown officially booked the role on February 18, 1996, her 21st birthday. Brown made her first appearance as Carly on April 5, 1996. In September 1999, Brown revealed to Soaps in Depth that she was contemplating renewing her contract so she could audition for pilot. Brown's plans to officially vacate the role were announced in January 2000. However, Brown extended her contract when the producers agreed to work around her schedule. In December 2000, Brown announced that she wanted to move on and the producers were contemplating a recast. Robin Christopher who played Skye Chandler on All My Children and Gina Tognoni — Kelly Cramer from One Life to Live — were both considered as Brown's replacement. The series was also suffering from the departures of several popular actors including Burton and Jonathan Jackson—who played Carly's cousin Lucky Spencer. Brown immediately denied rumors that a dispute with executive producer Jill Farren Phelps led to her departure. Brown filmed her final scenes in early April 2001, and made her final appearance on April 24.

In April 2001, Braun was announced as a Carly recast and made her first appearance on May 2, 2001. Initial speculation that Braun was only temporary and the character was slated to be written out was put to rest as Braun was put on contract with the series. According to Phelps, recast was always an option, but it was easier said than done. Phelps told the New York Post that she wasn't interested in a recast, but did so out of necessity. Braun had previously appeared on Party of Five and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The naturally brunette Braun even colored her hair blonde. Braun auditioned opposite Benard four times before booking the gig. Braun answered the casting call for the role of Sarah, which many assumed was a recast of Sarah Webber. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest from September 2001, Braun explained that "Right before booking this job, I had vowed to quit acting and just re-evaluate." After booking the role, Braun immediately did her research. They daytime newcomer admitted that she was nervous about replacing such a popular actress but welcomed the challenge. In early 2005, speculation grew over Braun's future with the soap due to Brown's recent exit from CBS' As the World Turns. In February 2005, it was announced that Braun had decided not to renew her contract and would vacate the role. Then president of ABC Daytime, Brian Frons admitted that he would love to have Brown back, but did not want to lose Braun. Braun made her final appearance April 15, 2005.

In late March 2005, it was announced that actress Bransford had been cast in the role of Carly. Phelps commented that it would be difficult but viewers would accept the recast as long as the actors made it work. Bransford beat out Melrose Place actress Jamie Luner for the role and The Bold and the Beautiful actress Sarah Buxton. Bransford made her first appearance on April 18, 2005. During Bransford's tenure, Shayne Lamas also made several guest appearances as a teenage Carly in several flashbacks. In September 2005, rumors circulated that Bransford had been let out of her contract with the series when a website claiming Bransford's official web site reported the news. It was also rumored that ABC had rehired Tamara Braun while some reported that the character would be written out completely. The news of Bransford's ousting was confirmed and a spokesperson said "Jennifer's casting in the role of Carly did not work out." The spokesperson praised Bransford as a "consummate actress" and wished her luck. Bransford filmed her final scenes on September 9, and made final appearance on October 5, 2005.

Wright, who had recently vacated the role of Cassie Layne Winslow on Guiding Light, was rumored to be on a short list of potential recast though Wright refused to comment. After an "exhaustive" search, ABC officially confirmed Wright's casting as the fourth actress to play the role of Carly. Frons commented: "Carly is a complex character and we are excited to bring Laura's talent, beauty and intelligence to this role." While Wright was sad to leave Guiding Light, she was excited to relocate to Los Angeles to play the role of Carly. "Wow! What a challenge" she said. Wright was due to begin filming in October after her deal with CBS expired. Wright made her debut on November 4, 2005. In November 2009, Wright announced on Twitter that she had re-signed with the soap for another four years, becoming the longest-tenured actress in the role. In July 2013, during the General Hospital Fan Club Weekend, it was reported that Wright extended her deal with the soap until 2017. In March 2014, it was announced that both Brown and Braun would reprise the role of Carly for the show's 51st anniversary on April 1, 2014, making cameo appearances alongside Wright. Eden McCoy portrayed a young Carly in flashback scenes for the April 8, 2020, episode.

Background

Officially, former head writers Claire Labine (1993–96) and Robert Guza, Jr. (1996–2000, 2002–11), along with script writers Karen Harris and Patrick Mulcahey, are said to have created the character of Carly. In 1999, writer Patrick Mulcahey noted that the character had been somewhat of a work in progress at first. Mulchey explained that she was different from most characters because "We were afraid of her." The character was quite a big deal and very important to the series—so important that one writer even quit over it. "The pitfalls are obvious," Mulcahey said and "I imagine Bob [Guza, the headwriter] promised Wendy [Riche, the executive producer] and ABC that we had no intention of falling into them" the scribe continued. However, the writers themselves had no clue who the character was supposed to be. "That may sound like a horrifying confession, but in daytime, a successful character is always a collaboration between the writers and the actor." Mulcahey said the writers discussed who they felt Carly, as a character, is and that "the actor finds certain other decisions have to be made and makes them, sparks fly between the actor and another actor, we see what's happening on-screen and start playing around with it in the writing- that's how a character takes shape". The variety of actresses that auditioned for the role implied that there was not any set direction for the character. Brown spent the first few months of her tenure crafting a backstory to explain her character's actions. According to her backstory, the character was scripted as being born on November 5, 1973, in Jacksonville, Florida to the 16-year-old prostitute Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman) and immediately placed up for adoption because Bobbie could not care for her. The child is adopted by Virginia (Lois Nettleton) and her husband Frank Benson in Pensacola, Florida as Caroline Leigh Benson. Frank eventually walks out on his family and Virginia works so much that Caroline barely has a chance to develop a relationship with her. According to Brown, Virginia is always a bit cold and bitter toward Caroline. In her teen years, Caroline becomes best friends with Charlotte "Carly" Roberts (Kari Wührer). Carly's father Dan Roberts seduces the young Caroline destroying Carly's family and the girls friendship. Caroline then loses Carly who is presumably killed in a car crash.

Development

Using the alias Carly Roberts, the character ingratiates herself into the life of her biological mother Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman) through her enrollment in the student nursing program and they start to bond until Bobbie rejects her. Carly then seduces Bobbie's doctor husband Tony Jones and sets her sights on the couple's young son Lucas (Justin Cooper). In Carly's mind, the affair is Bobbie's karma for abandoning her. Carly wants from Bobbie what she feels she didn't get from her adoptive mother. As the affair dismantles a once happy marriage, Sarah Brown maintained Carly's intentions start off pure. With Bobbie shutting her out, Carly goes on the defensive and develops feelings for Tony which she is very reluctant to face. Though she knows the relationship is built on her lies of omission, Tony becomes the center of Carly's life. Meanwhile, Bobbie's brother Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) recognizes a kindred spirit in his niece and "that excites him"—which is why he keeps the secret. As the walls feel like they are closing in on her, Carly becomes impulsive and self-destructive and has a one-night stand with the troubled alcoholic A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan). According to Brown, the writing for Carly isn't to garner sympathy from viewers, but being aware her motives creates a certain intrigue.

Reception

Brown's portrayal of Carly has been the subject of universal acclaim. In July 2020, Soaps.com ranked Wright's casting as the fifth all-time best recasts on a soap opera. Editor Charlie Mason cited that Wright "put yet another unique stamp on the part." In 2023, Charlie Mason from Soaps She Knows placed Carly at fourth place on his ranked list of General Hospital’s 40+ Greatest Characters of All Time, commenting "You know how you know that Carly is one of the all-time greats on General Hospital? The character’s withstood two and a half recasts (from Sarah Brown to Tamara Braun to, briefly, Jennifer Bransford, then Laura Wright) to remain an unstoppable force of nature, a freight train you’d be terrified to be in front of but more often than not find yourself willing to get behind."
