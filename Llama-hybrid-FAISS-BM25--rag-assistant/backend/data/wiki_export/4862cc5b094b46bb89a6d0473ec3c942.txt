History
The college was founded in 1936 as the Barry School of Evangelism (1936–1950) (also called Barry Bible College). It was successively known as South Wales Bible College (1950–1985), Evangelical Theological College of Wales (1985–2006), and Wales Evangelical School of Theology (2006-2016). The school was situated in Barry from 1950 to 1985. Eryl Davies became Principal in September 1985, moving the college to the seven acre grounds of the historic Bryntirion House in Bridgend. Since 2007 the school has maintained a partnership with SaRang Community Church, a Korean church which has added Wales and the United Kingdom to its worldwide areas of active mission. In 2016, with the arrival as Michael Reeves as President, the college was renamed Union School of Theology.

The school had 215 students in 2019–2020 in undergraduate and graduate degree programs up to the Ph.D. The graduate programme was described by Iain Murray as "well-known British training schools for ministers and missionaries" that attracts evangelical Christians wishing to study for the ministry.

Criticism
The School has been the subject of criticism by the Bible League Quarterly and The Sword and the Trowel for its affiliation with the Korean churches, the involvement of the international director of the Lausanne movement on WEST's board till 2014, and claims of 'ecumenical connections' through the European Leadership Forum.
