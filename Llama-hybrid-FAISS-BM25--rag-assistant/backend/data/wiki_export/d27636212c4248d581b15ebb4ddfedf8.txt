History
The municipality of Søndre Undal was established in 1845 when the old Undal municipality was divided into Nordre Undal (population: 802) and Søndre Undal (population: 3,893). The name was later changed to Sør-Audnedal. On 1 January 1899, the western part of Sør-Audnedal (population: 1,734) was separated to become the new  municipality of Spangereid. The split left Sør-Audnedal with 2,958 inhabitants and an area of . During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Sør-Audnedal municipality (population: 2,323) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Vigmostad (population: 589) and Spangereid (population: 899) to create the new municipality of Lindesnes.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Audnedalen valley (). The prefix  means "southern" since it is the southern part of the valley. The first element of the name is the genitive case of the river name Auðna (now Audna). The river name is derived from the word  which means "destruction" or "wasteland" (because of the flooding that often happens along the river). The last element is  which means "valley" or "dale". Historically, the municipality was named Sør-Undal or Søndre Undal, which uses an older version of the valley name that had been corrupted and shortened over time as well as an alternate way of spelling "southern". The more modern spelling of "Sør-Audnedal" was introduced during the 20th century to bring back the historical look of the name.

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
