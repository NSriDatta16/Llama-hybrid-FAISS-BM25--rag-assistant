London Buses route 4 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England. Running between Archway station and Blackfriars station, it is operated by Metroline.

History

On 25 September 1993, the contract for route 4 was won by London Suburban Bus, who operated the route with Leyland Titans.

In April 2019, TfL announced that route 4 would be withdrawn between Waterloo station and St Paul's station and extended to Blackfriars station via Queen Victoria Street instead, with the change scheduled to take effect in June of that year.
