Stambaugh Auditorium is a concert hall located in Youngstown, Ohio, United States. First opened in 1926, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Stambaugh Auditorium was established through the generosity of Henry H. Stambaugh, one of the city's leading businessmen in the early 20th century, who had decreed in his will that there was to be a venue built for the entertainment, enjoyment and education of Youngstown and surrounding communities. Many Stambaugh events are offered at reasonable ticket rates and, at times, no cost at all, as to reflect the mission statement outlined by Henry H. Stambaugh's will.

The centerpiece of the complex is the Concert Hall, which can accommodate a crowd of 2,553 and houses the restored E.M. Skinner Pipe Organ. The venue also features the Jeanne D. Tyler Grand Ballroom, the Anne K. Christman Memorial Hall, and a Formal Garden at the southern end of the building, all of which can be rented for private functions. Events hosted at the auditorium include concerts, business functions, weddings, graduations and dance competitions.

History 
In 1926, The Henry H. Stambaugh Memorial Auditorium was dedicated, and a dream of Henry Stambaugh, local industrialist and philanthropist, was realized.  As a bequest to the city of Youngstown, Mr. Stambaugh envisioned a site to "be used for the enjoyment, pleasure, entertainment and education of the community residing in the Youngstown and contiguous theretoâ€¦"  The Auditorium was constructed at a cost of $1.3 million, designed by Harvey Wiley Corbett of the New York firm of Helme and Corbett and is modeled after the public auditorium in Springfield, Massachusetts, which was designed from the Pantheon in Paris.
 
On December 5, 1926, a formal dedication was held, and on December 6, 1926, the Monday Musical Club presented the first concert at Stambaugh, featuring humorist Will Rogers.  Since that day, Stambaugh has hosted a wide variety of performers, educators and speakers.  Artists from Tony Bennett to Bob Dylan, American Ballet to Liberace, Bruce Springsteen to the Cleveland Orchestra and countless others have all graced the main stage.

Preservation 
Stambaugh Auditorium has undergone several renovations and restorations to preserve the building's natural integrity.  The Anne Christman Memorial Hall was restored in 1995, followed by the Concert Hall in 2004 and office space improvements in 2004 and 2006. Over the years, additional parking was also added.  Most recently, the ballroom renovation and stage enhancements have all been part of continuing Henry H. Stambaugh's legacy to provide a facility for the entertainment and education of the community.

One of the many projects completed in recent years was the restoration of the E.M. Skinner Pipe Organ, which is housed in the Concert Hall.  The restoration began in 2009 and was completed in the fall of 2011.  The organ was disassembled after years of neglect and water damage. It was shipped to New Haven, Connecticut to the Thompson Allen Company.  The father of the owner of the Thompson Allen Company worked for E.M. Skinner.  The Thompson Allen Company cleaned and repaired the instrument, which was then returned and reassembled. The Organ was restored to its original 1926 glory and was rededicated in October 2011.  It is currently the only E.M. Skinner organ in the area and one of few working ones in the entire country.  Guests marvel at the instrument, especially when on behind-the-scenes tours of the organ chambers.

Looking towards the future, an extensive exterior renovation to Stambaugh Auditorium will make the building look as it did when dedicated in 1926.  Cleaning the building will again reveal the fluted Ionic columns and the front iron scroll work.  Repointing the joints of the building will keep out moisture and make the building more efficient with heating and cooling. Additional lighting will provide spectacular night views of the building.  And last but not least, a complete restoration of the Fifth Avenue stairs is needed.  All improvements are necessary to continue the legacy of high standards that Stambaugh Auditorium has worked so diligently to achieve.

Events 
Stambaugh Auditorium has grown to be much more than a wedding venue. With national tours, local shows, private events, fundraisers and dance competitions, Stambaugh has become very competitive in the local market as a premier event facility.  High school and college commencements, proms and business events are other examples of the variety of events that have grown in popularity over recent years.
