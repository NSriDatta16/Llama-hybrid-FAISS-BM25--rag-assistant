Career
In 1978–79 Haysman represented the Australian Under 19 team.

In 1981–82 he scored 264 for the South Australian U 23 side against WA.

Haysman made his Sheffield Shield debut in November 1982. He scored 126 against Queensland making him the first player to score a century in his Shield debut in more than ten years. That summer he made 684 first class runs at 57.

South Africa
In August 1985 Haysman signed to tour South Africa. He called it "the toughest decision I've ever had to make. But I'm a professional cricketer and I'm just pursuing my profession. Because I'm going to be playing with and against international players, I see the tour as a great chance for me to improve my own game and put that to good use when I get back to help South Australia."

Haysman struggled on the first tour making 326 first class runs at 29.63 but did well on the second, making 738 runs at 61.5.

He played in Australia in 1987/88 only making 287 first class runs at 26.09.

He moved back to South Africa and played there from 1988–89 to 1993–94.
