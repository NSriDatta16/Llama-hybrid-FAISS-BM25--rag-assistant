Prior to moving to the University of Pennsylvania, Guyer taught at the University of Pittsburgh from 1973 to 1978, and the University of Illinois, Chicago from 1978 to 1983.

Philosophical work

Guyer has written a dozen books on Kant and Kantian themes, and has edited and translated a number of Kant's works into English.  In addition to his work on Kant, Guyer has published on many other figures in the history of philosophy, including Locke, Hume, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and others. Guyer's Kant and The Claims of Knowledge (Cambridge University Press) is widely considered to be one of the most significant works in Kant scholarship. Recent works by Guyer include Knowledge, Reason, and Taste: Kant's Response to Hume (Princeton University Press), and The Cambridge Companion to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (Cambridge University Press).  More recently, he has published Virtues of Freedom: Essays on Kant's Moral Philosophy (2016), Kant on the Rationality of Morality (2019), and Reason and Experience in Mendelssohn and Kant (2020).

His other areas of specialty include the history of philosophy and aesthetics.  His three-volume work A History of Modern Aesthetics was published by Cambridge University Press in February 2014.  In 2021, Cambridge published  A Philosopher Looks at Architecture. Guyer was President of the American Society for Aesthetics in 2011–13.
