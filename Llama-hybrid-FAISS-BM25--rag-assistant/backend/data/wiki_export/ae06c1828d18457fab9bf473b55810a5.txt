"Pink Triangle" is a song by American rock band Weezer. As the third and final single from the band's second studio album Pinkerton (1996), it was released to radio on May 20, 1997 by DGC Records. The song was written by Rivers Cuomo.

Background
The song describes a man who falls in love with a woman with whom he imagines he could settle down and be married. However, he soon discovers that the object of his affection is a lesbian who possibly thinks that the man himself is gay. The song is based on a real person that Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo encountered while a student at Harvard, whom he fantasized a life with until he saw a pink triangle—a symbol used by the Nazis to label someone as gay, on her sleeve. According to Cuomo, a year and a half after the album was released he discovered that the woman was actually not a lesbian and had just been showing support for the gay community.

A promo single was sent to radio stations that also contained an acoustic version of the song recorded at Shorecrest High School in Seattle, Washington. The song received limited airplay and never charted and thus was deemed not to warrant a video. This would be the band's last single with bassist Matt Sharp before he left a year later.

In 2004, the band released its first DVD Video Capture Device, which features a video of the Shorecrest performance as well as a video cut by Weezer.com webmaster and longtime friend of the band Karl Koch that features footage shot by Jennifer Wilson, wife of Weezer drummer Patrick Wilson.

Composition
"Pink Triangle" is composed in the key of F# Major, with a tempo of 118 beats per minute.

Reception
Mark Beaumont of NME ranked "Pink Triangle" as Weezer's fifth best song. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club considered the song to be "less successful—musically and emotionally" compared to other songs on Pinkerton.
