Penyffordd or Pen-y-ffordd is a village, community and electoral ward in Flintshire, Wales, situated to the south east of Buckley and to the west of Chester. The name is derived from the Welsh Pen Y Ffordd â€“ roughly translated as "the highest or furthest point of the road". The resident population of Penyffordd, as measured in the 2001 Census, was 3,715, increasing to 3,874 at the 2011 census.

Penyffordd lies to the east of A550, south of its junction with the A55 (North Wales Expressway). The ward consists of the neighbouring villages of Penyffordd and Penymynydd, which are a ribbon development along the line of the former major road. There's also a zebra crossing which has been instated because former resident Adam Livingstone was hit by a motorist there.  

A hamlet named Pen-y-ffordd is also in Flintshire. It is located between Holywell and Prestatyn, near Mostyn.
