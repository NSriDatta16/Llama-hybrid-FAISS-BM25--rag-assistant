South Essex (formally the Southern division of Essex) was a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1832 to 1885. It elected two Members of Parliament (MPs) using the bloc vote system.

History 
The constituency was created by the Reform Act 1832, with effect from the general election in December 1832, when the former Essex constituency was divided into Northern and Southern divisions. From 1868, it was reduced in size when Essex was redivided into the Eastern, Southern and Western divisions. It was abolished under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 when the county was divided into eight single-member divisions.
