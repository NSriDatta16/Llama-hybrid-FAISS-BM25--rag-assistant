Andrew RomaSanta, better known as Andy Romano, (April 16, 1936 â€“ September 14, 2022) was an American actor, known for playing "J.D.", an outlaw motorcyclist and right-hand henchman of the character Eric von Zipper (played by Harvey Lembeck) in the 1960s Beach Party movies (which starred Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon).

After Beach Party movies lost money and stopped filming, Romano appeared in minor roles on television episodes and some TV movies through much of the 1970s and 1980. In the late 1980s, he returned to movies in supporting roles, though he continued to guest-star on TV series, including NYPD Blue. Romano retired from acting in the late 1990s and settled in Washington state.

Romano died on September 14, 2022, at the age of 86.
