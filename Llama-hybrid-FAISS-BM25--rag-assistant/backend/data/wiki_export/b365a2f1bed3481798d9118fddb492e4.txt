Tales of Ephidrina is an ambient/techno album by electronica duo Amorphous Androgynous, better known as The Future Sound of London (FSOL). It was released on 5 July 1993 through Quigley Records, a subsidiary label of Virgin. It was created from material the pair had been working on around the same time as their ambient FSOL title Lifeforms, while still containing some of the techno feel of Accelerator.

In 1996, Mixmag ranked the album at number 27 in its list of the "Best Dance Albums of All Time".

History
This album was their first one after signing with Virgin; they moved to London from Manchester and were given a free hand to do what they wanted. The album is unique, in that it is the only album they released in the 1990s that wasn't recorded at their Earthbeat studio, and is also the only release on a short lived stem of Virgin Records, Quigley. It was the only electronic album recorded under the name Amorphous Androgynous, before the moniker's psychedelic reappearance in 2002.

The name Ephidrina refers to a form of Amphetamine.
