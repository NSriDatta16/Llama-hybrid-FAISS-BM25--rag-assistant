Tussles in Brussels is a live DVD released by Swedish punk rock band The Hives. The live performance was recorded on 29 October 2004 at Ancienne Belgique while the band was on tour in Brussels, Belgium. The DVD also includes extras such as four music videos from the band, five television performances (including performances on Top of the Pops), and a 30-minute documentary film narrated by Little Steven as D. W. Johnson.

Critical reception
Betty Clarke of The Guardian gave the DVD four out of five stars, calling it a "mixture of animated fantasy and thrilling reality" and felt that the concert that follows the documentary "reveals that the Hives are simply a great garage rock band", writing that lead singer Pelle Almqvist "strut[s] harder than Mick Jagger and sermonis[es] like Jon Spencer".
