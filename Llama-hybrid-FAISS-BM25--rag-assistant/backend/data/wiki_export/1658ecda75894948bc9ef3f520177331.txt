Fair Weather was a British rock band formed in 1970 by former Amen Corner guitarist and singer Andy Fairweather Low. They are best known for their track "Natural Sinner".

Biography
The band evolved from a split within Amen Corner. While saxophone player Allan Jones went on to form Judas Jump, Fairweather Low led Dennis Byron (drums), Blue Weaver (organ), Clive Taylor (bass) and Neil Jones (guitar) into the new band, Fair Weather. The band scored a UK Singles Chart Number 6 hit with "Natural Sinner" in 1970
and recorded one album, Beginning From An End.  From the latter were drawn three more singles, "Lay It On Me"/"Looking for the Red Label Pt. 2", "Tutti Frutti"/"Road To Freedom" and "Poor Man's Bum A Run"/"Don't Mess With Cupid". None charted and Fair Weather disbanded in 1971.

Fairweather Low went on to a successful solo career before taking up regular work with Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Roger Waters.

Weaver joined Strawbs and became an in-demand session player with Mott the Hoople, Pet Shop Boys and the Bee Gees. Bryon also became the Bee Gees' drummer.
