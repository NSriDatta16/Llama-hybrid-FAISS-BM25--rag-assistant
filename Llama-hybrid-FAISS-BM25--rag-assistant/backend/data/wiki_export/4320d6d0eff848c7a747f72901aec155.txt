Flavors 

Hosmer makes about 35 Flavors including Diets, Seltzers and a line of "Antique Sodas" made with cane sugar. They feature all of the classic flavors of the New England Independent bottlers, such as Root Beer, Birch Beer, Cream Soda, Sarsaparilla and Lime Rickey. Other sodas include unique offerings such as Peach, Strawberry and Cranberry, Cocoa Cream and (cane sugar) Ginger Beer.

Glass Bottles Only 

Hosmer uses two sizes of reusable glass bottles (28 & 12 oz.) to package their products, which are then returned  by customers, cleaned and refilled, in keeping with the company's long standing green mission. Hosmer Mountain has charged a deposit since before the CT State Bottle Bill required it of soft drink manufacturers.
