Professional career

Dallas Cowboys
Jones was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round (24th overall) of the 1992 NFL Draft, becoming the first player from East Carolina University to be drafted that high. The team moved Ken Norton Jr. to outside linebacker, allowing him to become the second rookie (Eugene Lockhart) in Cowboys history to start at middle linebacker, and the second rookie (Lee Roy Jordan) linebacker in franchise history to start in a season-opener. He helped the Cowboys establish the top defense in the league in 1992, was named NFC rookie of the year and was selected to the NFL All-rookie team. He started 13 out of 15 games, posting 108 tackles (second on the team), one sack, 2 tackles for loss, 4 quarterback pressures, one pass defensed and one fumble recovery. He had 16 tackles against both the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.

In 1993, he started the first 3 games after being benched in favor of Ken Norton Jr., who took over his middle linebacker duties. He collected 36 tackles (2 for loss) and 4 special teams tackles. He had 16 tackles against the Washington Redskins and 11 tackles against the Buffalo Bills.

In 1994, he regained the starting job at middle linebacker after Norton left in free agency. He would come back to have the best year of his career, going on to be selected to the Pro Bowl, after registering 162 tackles (then the fourth-highest single season total in Cowboys history), 2 quarterback pressures, 4 tackles for loss and 3 passes defensed.

In 1995, he was fourth on the team with 100 tackles, despite missing the last 3 games with a strained abdominal muscle. During his four seasons with the Cowboys, Jones helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XXVII, Super Bowl XXVIII and Super Bowl XXX.

In the 1990s, the Cowboys organization felt they could find linebackers through the draft, without the need of paying a premium and adversely impacting the salary cap, so they allowed talented and productive players like Ken Norton Jr., Darrin Smith, Dixon Edwards, and Randall Godfrey, to leave via free agency, instead of signing them into long-term contracts. After he became a free agent in 1996, the Cowboys replaced him by signing free agent Fred Strickland.

St. Louis Rams
On March 5, 1996, he signed as a free agent with the St. Louis Rams. In 1997, he led the team with 115 tackles. On June 2, 1998, he was released from the team for salary cap reasons.

Miami Dolphins
On June 10, 1998, he signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins, reuniting him with Jimmy Johnson. That season, Jones became an integral part of a defense that allowed an NFL low 265 points. He started all 16 regular season games at strongside linebacker and finished third on the team with 100 total tackles. He also put together career-high numbers of five sacks, two interceptions and five passes defensed. He returned one of those interceptions for the first touchdown of his career. After the season, the Dolphins rewarded him with a five-year contract extension.

On March 1, 2001, he was released by the Dolphins after not restructuring his contract.

Washington Redskins
On June 12, 2001, Jones signed a one-year deal with the Washington Redskins, starting 9 of 15 games during the season.

Houston Texans
On April 25, 2002, he signed as a free agent with the Houston Texans for the franchise's inaugural year, but upon his request was released before the season started on May 14.

Green Bay Packers
One week later, he signed with the Green Bay Packers, but was released shortly after to make room for signed free agent Hardy Nickerson.

Over his 10-year career, he played in 151 total games and registered 974 tackles, 8 quarterback sacks and 3 interceptions.
