Sassy Swings the Tivoli is a 1963 live album by American jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and her trio, produced by Quincy Jones. The performances were recorded in the concert hall of the Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, over four days in July 1963.

Reception
The initial Billboard review from October 12, 1963 commented Vaughan was "really swinging on this album", and described it as a "must for Sassy's fans" and that there was "radiation on both sides of the footlights".

Scott Yanow on Allmusic.com gave the album four and a half stars out of five and commented that the album was a "gem" that this "wonderful live session" was "one of her very best of the 1960s".
