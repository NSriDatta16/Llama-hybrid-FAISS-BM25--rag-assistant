Snow is the first solo album by Curt Kirkwood of the alternative rock band Meat Puppets, released in 2005. In his solo career, short though it was, he has pursued a more countrified aspect of his music. "Golden Lies" was originally written as the title track for the previous Meat Puppets album, however, it was ironically excluded. The album was recorded in only 20 days.

The album's title track was incorporated into the Meat Puppets' setlist upon their reunion tour in 2006.
