Barry Price (born 8 March 1949) is a former Australian rules footballer who played 158 games and scored 60 goals with Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) between 1966 and 1977.

Price debuted in 1966 aged 17. Though only 177Â cm tall, Price was courageous and just as productive with his hands as his feet. His evasive skills were excellent and he thrived on Bob Rose's intense training regimes, always presenting super fit. He won the Copeland Trophy, awarded to Collingwood's best and fairest player, in 1969. In 1970, he represented Victoria in interstate football.

In 1976, Price moved to play with Claremont in the West Australian National Football League (WANFL). He played for three years with Clarement before returning to Collingwood for a solitary game in 1979.

He was the coach of Prahran Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1983.
