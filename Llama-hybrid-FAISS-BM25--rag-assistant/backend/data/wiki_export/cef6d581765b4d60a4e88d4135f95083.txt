Jeanne Beker,  (; born 19 March 1952) is a Canadian television personality, fashion editor, and author.

Family

Jeanne Beker was born in Toronto, Ontario to father Joseph Beker and mother Bronia Beker, two Jewish Holocaust survivors born in Kozova, Poland (now in Ukraine) who immigrated to Canada from a displaced persons camp in Austria. Jeanne was previously (from 1986 to 1998) married to Toronto radio personality Bob Magee, but is now divorced. They have two daughters together.

Early life

She attended high school at William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute. She first launched her career as an actor, landing a role in the CBC Television sitcom Toby in 1968. She subsequently entered the theatre program at York University, and then went to Paris to study mime under Étienne Decroux. She then returned to Canada, working for CBC Radio as an arts and entertainment reporter in St. John's while pursuing her theatrical career.

Journalism career

Beker returned to Toronto in 1978, producing daily lifestyle and entertainment features for 1050 CHUM. She launched Citytv's ground-breaking music magazine show The NewMusic in 1979 as co-host with J. D. Roberts and also became an entertainment reporter for CityPulse. She briefly hosted Rockflash news segments on MuchMusic when that station was launched, hosted MovieTelevision, and produced segments for Entertainment Tonight.

In 1995, Beker launched @Fashion, the Internet's first-ever fashion website, for American communication giant MCI.

From 1985 to 2012 Beker hosted FashionTelevision, the role with which she is most famously associated. Beker hosted the program and acted as a segment producer for the entirety of the program run. Beker announced that the program had ceased production in 2012, via Twitter, stating: "This dream is over: After 27 glorious years, FT production ceased today." Canadian born celebrity stylist Brad Goreski paid tribute to Beker and the program upon hearing the news of its cancellation, saying: "She reported from the shows in Milan and New York with such intensity – as if she was a war correspondent reporting from the front lines."

From 2012 to 2014 Beker hosted fashion and entertainment segments for Bell Media properties including CTV News, Canada AM and The Marilyn Denis Show. Simultaneously, Beker wrote articles on fashion and style for the Toronto Star, The Kit and The Loop.

Beker is currently a columnist for The Globe and Mail.

Fashion entrepreneurship

From 2001 to 2002, Beker had her own limited edition fashion lines, "Jeanne Beker" for Eaton's, and "Inside Out by Jeanne Beker" with Sears Canada.

Beginning in 2010, Beker released a clothing line entitled 'Edit by Jeanne Beker' at The Bay of which she directly curates a collection of designer clothing for Fall/Winter and Spring/Summer seasons.

In 2013, Beker released a line of footwear with retailer The Shoe Company and a line of eyewear through FYSH UK.

In 2014, Beker launched a capsule collection of clothing, fashion jewelry and eyewear with Rogers Media electronic retailer The Shopping Channel.
