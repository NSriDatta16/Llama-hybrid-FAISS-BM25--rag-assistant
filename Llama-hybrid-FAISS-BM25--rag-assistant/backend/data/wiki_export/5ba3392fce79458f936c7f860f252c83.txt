Bell Gardens High School is a public high school in Bell Gardens, California, part of the Montebello Unified School District.

History
The campus was built in the 1930s and 1940s. After years of development and construction, BGHS's new three story building was opened on December 18, 2005.

In 2005, the high school underwent a further phase of renovation when the school's athletic field, otherwise known as "Lancer Stadium", received a $1 million upgrade. This was the change the school decided to make instead of sizing up the auditorium and building up the schools music room and choir room (plans on that are set to happen on the next big loan). The gradually decaying long-standing natural dirt/grass field was replaced with a state of the art synthetic turf playing field along with a new 400 meter track surrounding it. The process commenced during the latter half of the 2004–2005 school year and was gradually completed the following spring in January 2006.
