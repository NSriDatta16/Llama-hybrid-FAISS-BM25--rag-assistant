The Australian Statistician is the head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

On 18 June 1906, the first Statistician of the Commonwealth of Australia was appointed to carry out the provisions of the Census and Statistics Act 1905. Later in the same year the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics was formed (renamed the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1975).

Timothy Augustine Coghlan was offered the position in December 1905, but had to decline due to his obligations to the New South Wales government.
