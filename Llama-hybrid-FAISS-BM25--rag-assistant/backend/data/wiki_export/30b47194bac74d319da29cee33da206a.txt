The Man I Love is an album by jazz singer Peggy Lee with an orchestra arranged by Nelson Riddle and conducted by Frank Sinatra. This was Lee's first album after returning to Capitol.

Reception 

AllMusic gave the album three and a half stars. Critic William Ruhlmann wrote that Sinatra directed Lee to sing like Billie Holiday, "to reinforce the near-victimhood of the woman depicted in the songs." Nelson Riddle's "lush strings...hint of dark things" in "a superb pairing of singer, conductor, and arranger".
