CJRX-FM (106.7 MHz) is a radio station in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports & Media, the station airs a mainstream rock format branded as 106.7 Rock.

History
The station was founded as CJOC in 1926, named after its founder, Jock Palmer. In 1928, it was bought by Taylor Pearson & Carson, which evolved into Selkirk Communications. Originally on 1100 AM, it moved to 1120 in 1928, 1400 in 1942 and 1220 in 1960.

The station was a founding affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936 and then of its Trans-Canada Network until 1962 when it became a CBC Radio network affiliate. The station disaffiliated in 1978.

Along with most of Selkirk's radio holdings, CJOC was sold to Rogers in 1989 after Selkirk merged with Maclean-Hunter. On January 19, 2000 CJOC moved to FM under new call letters, CJRX-FM. With the new frequency and call letters also came with a change in genre, from country to rock.

In June 2016, Rock 106 slightly rebranded to 106.7 Rock.
