The GMT 400 and similar GMT 480 was the platform used for the Chevrolet C/K and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks beginning with the 1988 model year. The GMT 410, GMT 420, GMT 425, and GMT 430 variants were derived for full-size SUVs, including the 1992–1994 Chevrolet Blazer and 1995–2000 Tahoe, and the GMC Yukon from late 1991 to 2000. 

This was the first GMT designation for the C (RWD) and K (4WD/AWD) series full-size trucks and SUVs.

The engineering for the GMT400 was done by the GM Truck & Bus group, working primarily out of a rented facility at Pioneer Engineering on 9 mile Road in Warren, MI.

GMT 400 frames were built by A.O. Smith Automotive Products, Dana Holding Corporation, and Tower Automotive.

Engines included the gasoline 4.3 L V6, 5.0 L V8, 5.7 L V8, 7.4 L V8, and diesel 6.2 L and 6.5 L V8s. Throttle-body injection (TBI) was used on gas engines through 1995. Central point injection (CPI) was used on the 1996–2000 4.3 L, 5.0 L, and 5.7 L engines, while the 1996–2000 7.4 L V8 used sequential fuel injection (SFI).   

The GMT400 series was replaced by the GMT800 vehicles beginning in 1998 (for the 1999 model year). The GMT400 remained in production, with the lineup slowly pared down until the last models were discontinued in 2002. The GMT400 truck models were built at Ft. Wayne, Indiana; Pontiac, Michigan; Flint, Michigan; Oshawa, Ontario, Canada; and SUVs at Janesville, Wisconsin and Arlington, Texas.
