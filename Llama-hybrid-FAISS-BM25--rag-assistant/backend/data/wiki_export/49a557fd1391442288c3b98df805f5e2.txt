David Miotke (born December 15, 1944) is an American keyboard player and singer, who under the name Dave Michaels was co-founder of the 1960s acid rock band H. P. Lovecraft.

Born in Chicago, Miotke studied at Northwestern University earning a bachelor's degree in music theory and composition and a master's degree in applied piano. While an undergraduate in 1967, and performing under the name Dave Michaels, he joined folk singer George Edwards in forming the band H. P. Lovecraft.  They released two albums, H. P. Lovecraft and H. P. Lovecraft II, which were both characterised by Edwards and Michaels' striking vocal harmonies and by Michaels' multi-instrumental skills.  Michaels departed from the band in September 1968 to return to his studies.
