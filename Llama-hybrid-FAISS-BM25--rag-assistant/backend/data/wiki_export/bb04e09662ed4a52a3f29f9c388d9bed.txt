Legal definitions 
According to Japanese law, the term "shonen" refers to "a person from the time they enter elementary school until the time they are 15 years of age", and  "Any person who has not reached the age of 15 years" (, Article 2.1). In the realm of education and culture, this is the period of compulsory education.  While the term "shonen" can refer to both young males and young females, the generally accepted term for young females is shōjo.
