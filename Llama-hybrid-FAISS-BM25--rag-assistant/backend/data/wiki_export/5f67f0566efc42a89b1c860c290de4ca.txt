History

Dixie High School was the first high school in St. George, and was founded in 1911 under the name St. George Academy.  Nicknamed "Dixie" Academy, the tradition of white-washing the name "DIXIE" on a sandstone rock formation overlooking the St. George valley (the Sugarloaf) began in 1913. The name comes from a regional nickname, that began with Mormon pioneers in the area. In 1963 the Dixie Academy split into Dixie High School and Dixie College (which eventually became Utah Tech University).

Dixie High transitioned to a new building in the early 2000s.  Construction began in 2001 with a new arts department wing that featured an auditorium and choir and band rooms.  The main, three-story school building was constructed in an adjacent parking lot.  In 2004 the student body moved to the new building, and the majority of the old building was torn down (one classroom remains for use as auto-tech classes).  Construction was completed before the 2005â€“2006 school year with a new gym and water feature.
