Birim South District is one of the thirty-three districts in Eastern Region, Ghana. Originally it was formerly part of the then-larger and first Birim South District (with Akim Oda as its capital town) in 1988, which was created from the former Birim District Council, until the western part of the district was split off to create a new Birim South District on 29 February 2008; thus the remaining part has been renamed as Birim Central Municipal District, with Akim Oda as its capital town. However, on 15 March 2018, the eastern part of the district was split off to become Achiase District; thus, the remaining part has been retained as Birim South District. The district assembly is located in the southwest part of Eastern Region and has Akim Swedru as its capital town.
