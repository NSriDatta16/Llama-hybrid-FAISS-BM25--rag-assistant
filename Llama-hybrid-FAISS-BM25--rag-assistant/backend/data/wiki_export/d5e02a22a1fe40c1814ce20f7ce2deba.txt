The song was performed by Christine Guldbrandsen. The Norwegian broadcaster Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK) organised the national final Melodi Grand Prix 2006 in order to select the Norwegian entry for the 2006 contest in Athens, Greece. 18 entries competed in the national final that consisted of three semi-finals, a Last Chance round and a final. Eight entries ultimately qualified to compete in the final on 4 February 2006 where the winner was determined over two rounds of public televoting. The top four entries in the first round of voting advanced to the competition's second round—the Gold Final. In the second round of public televoting, "Alvedansen" performed by Christine Guldbrandsen was selected as the winner with 77,568 votes.

As one of the ten highest placed finishers in 2005, Norway automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing during the show in position 5, Norway placed fourteenth out of the 24 participating countries with 36 points.

Background 

Prior to the 2006 contest, Norway had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 44 times since its first entry in . Norway had won the contest on two occasions: in 1985 with the song "La det swinge" performed by Bobbysocks!, and in 1995 with the song "Nocturne" performed by Secret Garden. Norway also had the two dubious distinctions of having finished last in the Eurovision final more than any other country and for having the most "nul points" (zero points) in the contest, the latter being a record the nation shared together with Austria. The country had finished last 10 times and had failed to score a point during four contests. Following the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, Norway has, to this point, finished in the top 10 once: in 2005 when Wig Wam finished ninth with the song "In My Dreams".

The Norwegian national broadcaster, Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK), broadcasts the event within Norway and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. NRK confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2006 Eurovision Song Contest on 4 July 2005. The broadcaster has traditionally organised the national final Melodi Grand Prix, which has selected the Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in all but one of their participation. Along with their participation confirmation, the broadcaster revealed details regarding their selection procedure and announced the organization of Melodi Grand Prix 2006 in order to select the 2006 Norwegian entry.

Ratings

Criticism of foreign songwriters 
Out of the 18 competing entries in Melodi Grand Prix 2006, only five featured Norwegian songwriters (two of them went on to place in the top two) with a majority of the remaining (12) being written by Swedish songwriters. This led to criticism from the local public and press in the days leading up to the competition. Melodi Grand Prix project manager Stian Malme stated that there were many songs written by Swedes because "they were simply among the better ones". Malme also stated that more than 60% of the submitted songs came from foreign songwriters and emphasised that all performers are Norwegian. On 3 March, NRK held a debate with Norwegian songwriters to raise their participation in future editions of Melodi Grand Prix.

Promotion 
Christine Guldbrandsen specifically promoted "Alvedansen" as the Norwegian Eurovision entry on 15 March 2006 by performing the song during the Greek Eurovision national final Feel the Party.

At Eurovision
According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country, the "Big Four" (France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom) and the ten highest placed finishers in the 2005 contest are required to qualify from the semi-final in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from the semi-final progress to the final. As one of the ten highest placed finishers in the 2005 contest, Norway automatically qualified to compete in the final on 20 May 2006. On 21 March 2006, an allocation draw was held which determined the running order and Norway was set to perform in position 5, following the entry from Latvia and before the entry from Spain.
