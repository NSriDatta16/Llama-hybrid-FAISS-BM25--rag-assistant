The 8th World Cup season began in December 1973 and concluded in March 1974. Piero Gros of Italy won the overall title, denying the runner-up, countryman Gustav Thöni, a fourth straight overall title. Annemarie Pröll of Austria won the women's overall title, her fourth of five consecutive.

The break in the schedule was for the 1974 World Championships, held February 3–10 at St. Moritz, Switzerland.

Due to the growth of the professional skiing tour (especially in the United States), which now featured World Cup winning stars such as Jean-Claude Killy, Karl Schranz, Patrick Russel, and Jean-Noël Augert,  no World Cup races were held in North America for the first time in its history; the next time this happened was during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020-21 season.  Instead, the entire 1973–74 season took place in Europe.
