Heinrich Brody (German), Bródy Henrik (Hungarian) or Haim Brody () (21 May 1868 – 1942) was a Hungarian (after 1918 Czechoslovakian) rabbi. He was born in Ungvár, in the Ung County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Ukraine).

He was a descendant of Abraham Broda. Educated in the public schools of his native town and at the rabbinical colleges of Tolcsva and Pressburg, Hungary, Brody also studied at the Hildesheimer Theological Seminary and at the University of Berlin, being an enthusiastic scholar of the Hebrew language and literature.

He was for some time secretary of the literary society Mekiẓe Nirdamim, and in 1896 founded the "Zeitschrift für Hebräische Bibliographie", of which he was coeditor with A. Freiman.

Brody was the rabbi of the congregation of Náchod, Bohemia and chief rabbi of Prague (both cities then part of Austria-Hungary), before moving to Palestine. In Czechoslovakia, he was the leader of the Mizrachi movement.
