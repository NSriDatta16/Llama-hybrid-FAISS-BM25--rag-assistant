The mountain slopes are quite steep, with lower inclines ranging from 30 to 60 degrees and upper inclines from 60 to 90 degrees.  The wilderness contains the headwaters of the Collawash, and Little North Santiam rivers.

Vegetation 
The forest consists almost solely of coniferous species such as Douglas Fir, Western Hemlock, and Western Red Cedar, but deciduous red alder is also prevalent along creeks.  Pacific yew is also common in certain parts of the wilderness, and rhododendrons can be seen blooming profusely throughout many areas around early June.  Bull of the Woods contains one of the last stands of old growth in western Oregon, and is home to the northern spotted owl.
