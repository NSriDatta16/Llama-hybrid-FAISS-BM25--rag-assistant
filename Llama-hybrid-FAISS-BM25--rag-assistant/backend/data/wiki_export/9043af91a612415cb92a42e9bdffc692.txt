Ibn Sab'īn ( ) was an Arab Sufi philosopher, the last philosopher of the Andalus in the west land of Islamic world. He was born in 1217 in Spain and lived in Ceuta. It has been suggested that he was a Neoplatonic philosopher, a Peripatetic philosopher, a Pythagorean philosopher, a Hermeticist, a Kabbalist, an alchemist, a heterodox Sufi, a crypto-Shīʿī, a plagiarizer, a pantheist, and an arrogant seeker of fame, though none of these adequately characterise Ibn Sab'in. 

Ibn Sabʿīn is most famously remembered for his replies to questions sent to him by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. He was recognized by Michele Amari as the author, among others, of the responses to the famous Sicilian Questions. He was also the author of the Budd al-Arif, amongst other works. He was also known for his knowledge of the "hidden sciences" and was well versed in knowledge of Islam and of other religions. From his time and continuing through to today, Ibn Sabʿīn has been criticized for his views, though often by detractors who did so without an in-depth knowledge of his works, as many of the accusations against Ibn Sabʿīn are invalidated by Ibn Sabʿīn’s own writings, and suggest that some of our author’s critics were not even familiar with his works. 

In approximately 668/1270 Ibn Sabʿīn died in Mecca, under suspicious circumstances. There are two descriptions of his death, one that states that he was poisoned and another that reports that he committed suicide. However there is evidence indicating that the story of Ibn Sabʿīn’s suicide was fabricated. Casewit states that “his alleged suicide seems untenable firstly because it was related by one of Ibn Sabʿīn’s foes, and secondly because suicide is wholly contrary to both Islamic law and Ibn Sabʿīn’s philosophical beliefs.” Despite the mutually exclusive versions, it is the more controversial suicide adopted by Massignon and Corbin that is repeatedly stated, and even fictionalised by Bensalem Himmich in A Muslim Suicide.
