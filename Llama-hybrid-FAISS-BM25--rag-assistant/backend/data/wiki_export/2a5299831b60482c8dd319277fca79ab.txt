Extreme tourism (also often referred to as danger tourism or shock tourism, although these concepts do not appear strictly similar) is a niche in the tourism industry involving travel to dangerous places (mountains, jungles, deserts, caves, canyons, etc.) or participation in dangerous events. Extreme tourism overlaps with extreme sport. The two share the main attraction, "adrenaline rush" caused by an element of risk, and differ mostly in the degree of engagement and professionalism.

Well-known extreme tourist destinations include:
Chernobyl Tours – Ukraine
Swimming in the Devil's Pool in Victoria Falls – Zambia and Zimbabwe
Walking the Plank at Mount Hua – China

Green Zone – Baghdad, Iraq
