Arquitectonica is an international architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, and urban planning design firm headquartered in Miami, Florida’s Coconut Grove neighborhood. The firm also has offices in ten other cities throughout the world. Arquitectonica began in 1977 as an experimental studio founded by Peruvian architect Bernardo Fort-Brescia, Laurinda Hope Spear, Andrés Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, and Hervin Romney.

Today, the firm continues to be led by Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Hope Spear, and has designed such famous buildings as the Banco de Credito Headquarters, Lima (1988), Atlantis Condominium, the Pink House, and the American Airlines Arena in Miami and the Westin Hotel and entertainment complex in New York, amongst many others. Until 2010, Arquitectonica's global headquarters were in Downtown Miami, until their new offices at 2900 Oak Avenue in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami were opened in 2010. Arquitectonica also has regional offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Madrid, Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manila, Dubai, São Paulo, and Lima.

The firm is known for sophisticated surface patterning and facade articulation. Arquitectonica's structures are bold in color and graphic in form and the firm has become famous for its signature style, a dramatic, expressive 'high tech' modernism.

Works and projects
In June 2011, two new major projects were announced for Arquitectonica, both in Downtown Miami: the new $700 million Brickell City Centre project in Miami's Brickell neighborhood, and the $3-billion Genting Resorts World Miami project in Miami's Arts & Entertainment District neighborhood.
