Early life
Eggert was born in Glendale, California. Her mother, Gina Duncan, was a British-born talent agent, and her father, Rolf Eggert, was a German-born canning-company executive.

An agent saw her and offered her parents a role for her in a Johnson's baby shampoo commercial.

In 1980, at age eight, Eggert landed a role in the film Rich and Famous, opposite Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen, playing Bergen's character's young daughter.

Also in 1980, Eggert provided the voice of Dennis's snobby archrival Margaret Wade in Dennis the Menace in Mayday for Mother, which was the first animated adaptation in the Dennis the Menace trilogy.

Personal life
Eggert has two daughters. She was engaged to actor Corey Haim, with whom she starred in Blown Away (1992), The Double 0 Kid (1992) and Anything for Love (1993). She is credited with helping to save Haim's life at least once by taking him to the hospital to detox during a 'narcotic rush', although she has said: "I spent a lot of nights in emergency rooms with him. I don't think that I saved his life, I just think that I was there for him." She has never married. 

In 2015, she appeared on the television series Botched for a breast reduction.

Eggert has accused her former Charles in Charge co-star Scott Baio of sexually harassing and sexually abusing her as a minor, beginning at age 14. Baio has adamantly denied the claims. Baio has said that they engaged in a one-time consensual sexual encounter when Eggert was 18, which Eggert initiated. Eggert has said that she was 17, and that Baio initiated their encounter.
