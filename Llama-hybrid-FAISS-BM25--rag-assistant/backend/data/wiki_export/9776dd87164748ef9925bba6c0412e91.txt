Gwyneth (sometimes Gweneth or Gwynyth) is a Welsh feminine given name which derives from the kingdom of Gwynedd. It gained popularity, first in Wales and then across the English speaking world, in the 19th century. This may have been the result of author Ann Harriet Hughes, who adopted Gwyneth Vaughan as her pen name.
