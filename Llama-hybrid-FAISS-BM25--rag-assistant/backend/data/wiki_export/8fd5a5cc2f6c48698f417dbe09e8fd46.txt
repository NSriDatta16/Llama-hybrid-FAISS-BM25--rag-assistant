During his career as a solo musician, Michael released five studio albums: Faith (1987), Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 (1990), Older (1996), Songs from the Last Century (1999), and Patience (2004).

He also found success at the MTV Video Music Awards, receiving 4 awards from 16 nominations, including "Best Direction in a Video" for the song "Father Figure" in 1988.
