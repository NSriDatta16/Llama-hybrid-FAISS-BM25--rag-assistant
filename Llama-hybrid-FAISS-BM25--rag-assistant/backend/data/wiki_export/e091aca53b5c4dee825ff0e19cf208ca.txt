History

Beginnings

Chinabank, founded by Dee C. Chuan, Albino SyCip, Guillermo A. CuUnjieng, Carlos Palanca Sr. and other visionaries, opened its first office at No. 90 Rosario (now Quintin Paredes) Street, Binondo on August 16, 1920, with J.W. McFerran as the first general manager. Shortly afterward, Eugene E. Wing of the International Banking Corporation took over and managed Chinabank's operations until 1936. This mixture of cultures represented a seamless merger of Western and Eastern banking policies—an obvious lack during those days when financial institutions governed by Western policies declined credit loans of wealthy Filipino-Chinese businesspeople who operated on the principle of (Hokkien ) or trustworthiness. Chinabank recognized the value of sìn-iōng and granted small loans and opened credit accounts with patrons and suppliers without demand for collateral. In 1924, the company completed its headquarters in Binondo, the China Bank Building.

Chinabank later opened two overseas branches in China, one in Amoy in 1925 and another in Shanghai in 1929. However, both branches closed in 1944 when political conditions in China became inimical to operations.

When the Japanese occupational forces invaded Manila in 1942, Chinabank was closed. But in 1941, the bank began turning over assets to the United States High Commissioner to the Philippines Francis Bowes Sayre Sr. for safekeeping, with the help of the officials of the US Treasury Department of Manila. With these overseas assets and the Bureau of Banking's full cooperation, Chinabank reopened in 1945 and listed on the Manila Stock Exchange in 1947, among the first local banks to do so.

Chinabank played a key role in post-World War II reconstruction and recovery through its support to businesses and entrepreneurs in critical industries. It opened its first branch outside Manila in Cebu in 1949. 

In 1969, Chinabank computerized its operations, becoming the first bank in Southeast Asia to process deposit accounts online. China Bank upgraded its online system in 1988 and launched the TellerCard ATM account and TellerPhone, the first telephone banking service in the Philippines. In 1990, China Bank, along with seven other banks, set up BancNet, currently the country's largest ATM network.

In 1991, Chinabank acquired its universal bank license, ushering an era of expanded banking operations. It launched its consumer loans in 1994, Chinabank HomePlus Loan and Chinabank AutoPlus Loan, followed by China Check Plus, an interest-earning checking account in 1996.  In the same year, Chinabank accessed the offshore capital markets for the first time by issuing  Floating Rate Certificate of Deposit (FRCD).

As Chinabank invested in new technologies, it launched its Cash Management services in 2004, followed by internet banking (Chinabank Online) and remittance services in 2006.

In the same year, Chinabank, with 148 branches at the time, embarked on an aggressive branch network expansion program.  By its 90th year in 2010, the bank had nearly doubled its nationwide network to 269 branches.

Recent developments

Chinabank has been involved in strategic alliances to expand and strengthen its operations. In 2007, the bank entered into a Bancassurance joint venture with The Manufactures Life Insurance Company, one of the leading insurance companies in the world, to form Manulife China Bank Life Assurance Corporation (MCBLife), and acquired the majority shares in Manila Bank, one of the oldest savings banks in the country.

In 2008, Chinabank's thrift bank subsidiary China Bank Savings (CBS) began operations. CBS targets entry level and start-up customers to asset accumulators, offering products and services that match different life stages, like basic deposit products for those building up their savings, basic loan products to fund personal dreams, and investment products. In 2012, Chinabank acquired Pampanga-based Unity Bank, which was merged with CBS in 2014. The acquisition supported the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' Strengthening Program for Rural Banks (SPRB) Plus, which aimed to effectively serve the countryside and improve the delivery of financial services to rural communities by strengthening the thrift and rural banking industry. The merger fast-tracked the savings bank's branch expansion program.

In September 2013, Chinabank forged a deal to acquire a majority stake in Planters Development Bank (Plantersbank), a development-oriented finance institution nationally acclaimed as the country's lead bank for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The merger was approved in May 2014 by the BSP. Plantersbank was merged with CBS with the latter as the surviving entity  .   

To complete its range of product offerings, Chinabank entered into a credit card partnership with MasterCard in 2013. China Bank  launched three credit card types under the MasterCard brand in 2014: Chinabank Prime, Chinabank Platinum, and Chinabank World MasterCard.   

In 2014, Ricardo R. Chua succeeded Peter S. Dee as president and CEO of Chinabank. Dee joined the Bank in 1972 and served as president and CEO for 26 years. Chua joined China Bank in 1975, rose through the ranks, and had served as Chief Operating Officer from 1994 until his appointment as Chinabank president.

Chua was succeeded by William C. Whang in 2017. During his leadership, the bank embarked in its Binondo Heritage Restoration Project, the centerpiece of the bank's centennial celebration. The restored building bears  the National Historical Commission of the Philippines' historical marker and the Cultural Center of the Philippines' Important Cultural Property marker. Also on its 100th year, Chinabank breached the trillion-peso mark in assets. 

In 2023, Romeo D. Uyan Jr., who helped establish the bank's investment banking arm in 2014, became Chinabank President and CEO.

On the same date, the new members of the Plantersbank board were elected, and officers of China Bank and CBS were appointed to various board/management committees of Plantersbank.

The successful core banking migration was awarded as the Best Core Banking Implementation Project – Mid-Size Bank in The Asian Banker Technology Innovation Awards 2017.

Green bonds
Chinabank issued its first green bond in 2018, raising US$150 million to fund a fresh wave of environmentally-beneficial projects to help mitigate climate change. IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, was the sole investor in the bond.  The US$150 million bond proceeds were used to finance climate-smart projects, including renewable energy, green buildings, energy efficiency and water conservation, in accordance with the Green Bond Principles. This issuance brought up China Bank’s climate portfolio to over US$200 million, making it one of the market leaders for climate-smart financing in the country and one of a few banks that has established a clear sustainability strategy.
