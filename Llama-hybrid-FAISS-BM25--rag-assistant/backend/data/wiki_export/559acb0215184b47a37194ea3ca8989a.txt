Department of Computer Engineering

Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering

The purpose of the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering is to provide students with a professional education, enabling them to study and participate in applied and practical research studies. Laboratories are equipped for practical courses. The degree of "Bachelor of Science" (BS) is given to the students who have completed the 4-year undergraduate program. The program, established in 1977, gives the student the opportunity to specialize in the area of telecommunications, solid-state electronics, quantum electronics, power systems, microwave and antennas, high voltage and computer science. The department has programs for the degrees of Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PHD).

Department of Industrial Engineering

Industrial Engineering (IE) is a discipline concerned with the design of production systems, operations management and research (OR), ergonomics, automation, CAD/CAM, quality control, information technology (IT), artificial intelligence (AI) and systems simulation.

IE students take the same foundation courses as other disciplines. They also take some of the basic engineering sciences like engineering drawing, statics, strength etc. They take IE specialty courses in their later years. The IE students take manufacturing courses, which deal with manufacturing processes and other courses closely associated with the manufacturing.

IE has also a "person" section called ergonomics, although elsewhere it is called human factors. Industrial engineers sequence orders, scheduling batches, determine the number of materials handling units, arrange factory layouts and find sequences of motions.

The undergraduate students also take courses in probability and statistics. IE specialty courses that follow these include quality control, simulation, and stochastic processes.

Department of Civil Engineering

The department is furnished with equipment for construction materials, land surveying, structural mechanics, transportation, fluid mechanics, hydraulics, hydrology and water resources to serve the needs of education and research. There are reconstruction materials, structural mechanics, transportation, soil mechanics and hydraulics laboratories, used for instruction, graduate research and for expert service to industry. Students completing their courses are given a 'Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering' degree. Students do engineering practice at the end of their first, second and third years.

During the fourth year, technical elective courses are offered to enable the students to further their knowledge in specific fields. A graduate program is offered in the fields of construction materials, transportation, hydraulics, structural mechanics, geotechnics and construction management leading to the degree of Master of Science (MSc) in Civil Engineering.

Department of Food Engineering

Food Engineering provides the students with an engineering education directed in manufacture, preservation and distribution of food products. The theoretical and practical aspects of food industry ranging from the quality of raw materials to the final usage of products by consumers are the main concerns of food engineering.

Employment opportunities at the B.S. level include production management, product and process development, process design and project engineering. Food preservation operations and food processing operations are examples of activities that require the skills of food engineering technologists and engineers. The department offers education at both undergraduate and graduate levels (M.S. and PhD). The graduate programme aims to provide more depth and breadth to the undergraduate background of the students.

Department of Mechanical Engineering

Mechanical Engineering ranges from aerospace equipment, automobiles, heavy machinery, through to manufacturing, production and management.  The fields in which mechanical engineers work, cover design, manufacture, research, development, operations, maintenance, education and management. The curriculum is basically the same as that offered by the department when it was affiliated to M.E.T.U. leading to BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. Besides the general laboratories, facilities for graduate research and industrial projects are available

Department of Textile Engineering

The Department of Textile Engineering offers courses with laboratory training leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science. Along with the academic training, the students are required to participate in summer practice.
