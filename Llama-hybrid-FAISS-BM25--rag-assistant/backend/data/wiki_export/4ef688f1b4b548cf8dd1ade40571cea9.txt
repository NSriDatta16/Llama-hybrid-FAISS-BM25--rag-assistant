Manufacturing

Kopperå had one of the best microsilica factories, Elkem Meraaker, a member of the Elkem Group. Elkem Meraaker (originally Meraaker Smelteverk) started to manufacture carbide in 1898, and was later re-built to manufacture microsilica. But in 2005 the company made the decision to end microsilica manufacturing. The factory ceased operations in summer 2006 and the buildings were taken down by 2008.
