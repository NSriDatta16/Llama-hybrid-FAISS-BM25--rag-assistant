Teningen is a municipality in the district of Emmendingen, in the state Baden-Württemberg in Germany. It is situated on the river Elz, 15 km north of Freiburg.

Geography

Location 
Teningen is set on the edge of the Black Forest mountain range.

Geology 
The geological subsoil consists of sandstone and limestone and is covered by loess layers of different thickness. The Elz river created alluvial gravel and sand sediments that had been used as pastures but were adapted for agriculture in many cases.

Municipal subdivisions 
The municipality Teningen comprises four districts:  The main town Teningen and the formerly independent towns Heimbach, Köndringen and Nimburg.

Climate
The climate in this area is close to a Mediterranean microclimate, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. However, more year-round rain occurs than in the Rhine plateau because of the closeness to the Black Forest.  The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is "Cfb" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate). However, it is close to being humid subtropical (Cfa) due to the mean temperatures in July and August just under 22 °C. The city is close to the Kaiserstuhl, a range of hills of volcanic origin located a few miles away which is considered to be one of the warmest places of Germany and therefore considered as a viticultural area.
