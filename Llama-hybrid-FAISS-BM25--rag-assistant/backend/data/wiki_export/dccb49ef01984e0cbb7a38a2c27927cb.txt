Arthur "Art" Johnston (born August 3, 1947) is a Canadian politician. Johnston was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the constituency of Calgary-Hays as a Progressive Conservative.

Early life

In 2003, Johnston retired from the CPS as a patrol sergeant. During his service he was awarded the 12 year Police Service Medal and the 20 year Police Exemplary Medal.

Political career

Johnston first sought public office in the 2001 Calgary municipal election as alderman for Ward 12.

He also helped develop several bills including: Correction Amendment Act, 2007, Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act, Peace Officer Act, and Traffic Safety Amendment Act, 2007.

In the 2008 provincial election Johnston was reelected with 54% of the vote. He was chair of both the Cabinet Policy Committee on Community Services and the Social Care Facilities Review Committee, and a member of the Standing Committee on the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, the Legislative Review Committee, and the Standing Committee on Community Services.

Personal life

Johnston is currently married and has four sons. In addition to reading and playing badminton, Johnston enjoys hockey, is a member of the Fish Creek Recreational Hockey League, and is a two-time gold medal recipient in the Charles Schulz hockey tournament in Santa Rosa, California.
