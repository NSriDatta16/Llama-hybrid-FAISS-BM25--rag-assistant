The Edge of Infinity is the third full-length album by the Swiss band Lunatica. It was released on August 28, 2006. A release party took place at Sch√ºtzi in Olten (Switzerland) on September 23, 2006.

The band had originally held a poll to pick a cover song to include on the album, although they decided not to include any cover song after all, having enough of their own compositions for the album.
