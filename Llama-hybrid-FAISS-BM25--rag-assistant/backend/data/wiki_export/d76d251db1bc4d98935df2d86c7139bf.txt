Overview

The platform used in the Giulietta is Fiat Group's Compact, successor of the C-platform (base for Fiat Stilo, Fiat Bravo and Lancia Delta). Practically this is an all new modular platform, only the central front part coming from the previous C-platform, but that part is modified also. Fiat Group used around 100 million euros to developing it. Mistakenly the journalists called the C-Evo platform, but Fiat never called on this name.
 
84% HSS + UHSS: high strength and ultra high strength hot forged steels
7% hot-formed steels.
3.7% aluminum
2.3% xenoy: polymer material with high energy absorption capacity, forms polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate
3% low carbon mild steels 
In comparison to older Fiat platforms it has a longer wheelbase, shorter overhangs and an advanced new type of MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension. Depending on the market and trim level, 16, 17, or 18-inch wheels are available. Available tire sizes are 205/55 R16, 225/45 R17, and 225/40 R18.

In a viability plan forwarded to the US Government in February 2009, Chrysler (a partner of Alfa Romeo parent company Fiat) reported that the 147 replacement would come to market as the Milano and that it could be built in the US. However, as of early 2010 Fiat was instead planning to concentrate on bringing larger models to the US, such as the Giulia.

Engines

The range of engines includes the new 1.4 L T-Jet petrol and M-jet diesel family, all turbocharged. A six-speed manual and Dual Dry Clutch Transmission TCT (Twin Clutch Transmission) introduced at the 2010 Paris International Motor Show, will be choice gearboxes for customers. Fitted to the 1.4 MultiAir petrol and 2.0 MultiJet diesel, this compact six-speed gearbox reduces the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of both engines compared to the manual versions. The diesel drops to 119 g/km, while the petrol is reduced to 121 g/km, giving the latter best-in-class emissions and power output in its class for a petrol engine.

The Alfa Romeo Giulietta uses a new engine which utilizes a system known as Multiair. The system controls the amount of air going into the engine by controlling when air is allowed into the engine and how much the inlet valve opens. The system works by inserting a "tappet" between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the "tappet" thus changing the effective opening profile of the inlet valve. The system can also change the overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold which is used to increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a Start&Stop system and all until 2016 are Euro5 rated. From late 2015, all engines in the Giulietta range are Euro 6 compliant and all apart from the 2.0L MultiJet2 Diesel (2014) come with improvements to their  emission and fuel economy figures.

The top of the range model has 1.7 L turbocharged engine the 1750 TBi –  with an exclusive Quadrifoglio Verde configuration (called Cloverleaf in the UK).  At the 2011 Bologna Motor Show an LPG version of the Giulietta was unveiled.
