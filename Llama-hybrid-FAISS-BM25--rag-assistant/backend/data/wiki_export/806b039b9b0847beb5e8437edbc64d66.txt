Manchester East  was one of six single-member parliamentary constituencies created in 1885 by the division of the existing three-member Parliamentary Borough of Manchester. The others were: Manchester South, Manchester North, Manchester North East, Manchester North West and Manchester South West.  They were all abolished in 1918.

Boundaries
The constituency was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, and was defined as consisting of the following areas:
The Parish of Bradford,
The Parish of Ardwick,
The Parish of Beswick,
The part of the Parish of Chorlton-upon-Medlock north of the centres of Cavendish Street, Grosvenor Street, Upper Brook Street, Dover Street, St. Leonards Street, and Cheltenham Street.

The next redistribution took place under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 1918. The Manchester East seat was divided between the two new constituencies of Manchester Ardwick and Manchester Clayton.
