Greatest Hits was the first Goldie Lookin Chain album to be released nationally and on a major label (Atlantic Records). It was released in 2004 and took tracks from several of Goldie Lookin Chain's previous, self-released CD-R albums which had been given out and copied extensively.

The album was renamed Straight Outta Newport for its release in the U.S. on May 10, 2005, although it failed to make the Billboard 200 there.
