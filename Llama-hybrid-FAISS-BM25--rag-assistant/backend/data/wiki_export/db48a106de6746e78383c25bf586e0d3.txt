Thomas Fazio, ASGCA  (born February 10, 1945) is a golf course architect.

Fazio graduated in 1962 from Lansdale Catholic High School and was inducted into its hall of fame in 2007. He began his career in golf course design with his family's firm in suburban Philadelphia, which he left in the 1960s; he established his own firm in Jupiter, Florida in 1972. He is the nephew of George Fazio, who often credited Tom with jump-starting his own career in golf course architecture.

Fazio has designed more than 200 courses of which 46 have been ranked by Golf Digest in their greatest 200 courses in the United States. His individual honors include Best Modern Day Golf Course Architect, which he received from Golf Digest Magazine three times. In 1995, Fazio became only the second course architect to receive the highest recognition awarded by the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America - The Old Tom Morris Award.
