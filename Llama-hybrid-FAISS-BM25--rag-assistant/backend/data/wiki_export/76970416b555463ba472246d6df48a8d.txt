Øvre Tysdalsvatnet is a lake in the municipality of Hjelmeland in Rogaland county, Norway.  The  lake lies on the east side of the village of Årdal.  The  long lake is only about  wide and it has a fairly steep shoreline, which results in very little habitation around the lake.   

The name "Øvre" Tysdalsvatnet means "upper" Tysdalsvatnet to distinguish it from the lake Tysdalsvatnet located about  to the southwest.
