Gold is a two-disc compilation album by Bob Marley and the Wailers that was released on the Island Records label in 2005. The compilation is intended to be a career-spanning retrospective, and no fewer than two songs are selected from each of Bob Marley and the Wailers' albums with the company. Songs range from his first album for the label, Catch a Fire, and span all the way through to the last album Marley would live to see released in his lifetime, Uprising, concluding with the posthumous releases "Iron Lion Zion", and tracks from Confrontation.

This Gold compilation is not to be confused with another compilation Universal released later the same year under the Gold line, consisting of Marley's early pre-fame material with the Wailers dating from 1967 to 1972.
