Biv 10 Records was founded by Michael Bivins in 1992, through a joint venture with Motown Records.

History
In the early 1990s, Bivins’ Biv Entertainment management firm scored multiple successes with developing new acts (Boyz II Men, Another Bad Creation, and MC Brains) in conjunction with Motown Records. As a result, Motown bankrolled Bivins his own imprint, Biv 10 Records. The company's logo featured an outline of a hand holding a basketball with the name ‘BIV 10’ printed on the hand above the wrist.

While the label went on to score minor success with teen R&B groups Subway and 702, significant success largely evaded the company. The more prominent acts that Bivins had been responsible for, like Boyz II Men, were established before the commencement of the Biv 10 label, and were instead signed to Motown directly—where they remained after the launch.

In 2000, distribution of Biv 10 switched from Motown to Universal Records, with the release of BBD, the studio album from Bell Biv Devoe. In 2002, the label was dismantled & folded into Motown.
