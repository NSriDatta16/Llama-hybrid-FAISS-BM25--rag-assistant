Melikgazi, in Byzantine times known as Tzamandos, is a municipality and district of Kayseri Province, Turkey. Its area is 668 km2, and its population is 594,344 (2022). It covers the southern and eastern part of the agglomeration of Kayseri and the adjacent countryside.

History
The town was originally a border fortress built by the famous Armenian general Melias around the year 909/910.
In 1065, the town was given among other lands in the region to the last Bagratuni king Gagik II as exchange for him renouncing the kingdom of Armenia. 

Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan was born in Melikgazi, in the town of Ağırnas around 1488.

Political structure
The district Melikgazi was created in 1998 from part of the former central district of Kayseri, along with the district Kocasinan. At the 2013 Turkish local government reorganisation, the rural part of the district was integrated into the municipality, the villages becoming neighbourhoods. The mayor is Mustafa Palancıoğlu (AKP).
