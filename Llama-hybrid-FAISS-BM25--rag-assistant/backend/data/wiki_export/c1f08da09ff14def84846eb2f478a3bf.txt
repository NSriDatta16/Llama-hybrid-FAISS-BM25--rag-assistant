On 10 September 2008 the ASX placed a trading halt on the company when receivers took control of the company's Southport Central development. Sub-contractors walked off the site, afraid that they were not going to be paid for their work.  Receivers to the Jim Raptis development, Capital Finance, took control of the development later that month.

In April 2009 construction on the project was complete.
