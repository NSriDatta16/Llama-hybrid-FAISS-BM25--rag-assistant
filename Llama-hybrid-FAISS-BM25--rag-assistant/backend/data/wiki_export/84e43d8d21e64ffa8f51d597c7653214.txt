Jeffrey Allan Maggert (born February 20, 1964) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour Champions.

Early life and amateur career 
Maggert was born in Columbia, Missouri. He was raised on a golf course in The Woodlands, Texas, where he attended McCullough High School.

He attended Texas A&M University. Maggert was an All-American member of the golf team.

Professional career 
Maggert turned professional in 1986. Early in his career he played overseas, especially on the Asia Golf Circuit and PGA Tour of Australia. He had some early success, winning the 1989 Malaysian Open on the AGC and the 1990 Vines Classic on the Australian Tour. 

Early in 1990, he qualified for the Ben Hogan Tour, the PGA Tour's developmental tour. He was Player of the Year in 1990 where he won two tournaments. Maggert's good play on the Ben Hogan Tour ensured a promotion to the PGA Tour for 1991. He has won three times and finished runner-up 16 times on the PGA Tour. He has represented the United States in the Ryder Cup three times and in the Presidents Cup once.

In April 2003, Maggert was the 54-hole leader at The Masters, having shot a third round of 66 to charge through the field. He endured a disappointing final round, that included a triple bogey on the third hole, after the ball rebounded off the bunker lip and struck him, and then a quintuple bogey on the 12th after finding the water twice. Maggert would finish in solo fifth place, his career best finish at the Masters.

He withdrew from The Players Championship in 2008 after completing one round, when he learned that his older brother, Barry, had died in a single-engine airplane crash in Gilpin County, Colorado.

He started the 2012 season on a medical exemption after shoulder surgery in June. His 2011 season was limited to 18 events, making six cuts. He went to Q School to back up the nine starts and $567,086 on his exemption. Maggert could not satisfy his medical exemption and played the remainder of the 2012 season in the Q School/Nationwide Tour graduate category. He still managed to barely retain a PGA Tour card, finishing 123rd on the money list.

Senior career 
Maggert won on his Champions Tour debut in March 2014 at the Mississippi Gulf Resort Classic, becoming the 17th player to do so. He also became the seventh player to win on all the PGA Tour sponsored major tours (PGA Tour, Web.com Tour, and Champions Tour). He finished the three rounds at 11-under-par, two strokes ahead of Billy Andrade.

In May 2015, Maggert won his maiden senior major championship and second Champions Tour event at the Regions Tradition. After finishing in a tie at 14-under-par after regulation play, he defeated Kevin Sutherland in sudden-death playoff on the first extra hole with a birdie.

The following month, Maggert won his second senior major championship with a two stroke victory over Colin Montgomerie at the U.S. Senior Open. He began the final round tied for the lead with Bernhard Langer, but shot a five-under-par 65 to pull clear of the field and claim the win.

On November 10, 2019, Maggert won the season-ending event on the PGA Tour Champions, the Charles Schwab Cup Championship. Maggert won the event in dramatic fashion by holing out a wedge from the fairway for eagle on the third playoff hole, defeating Retief Goosen.
