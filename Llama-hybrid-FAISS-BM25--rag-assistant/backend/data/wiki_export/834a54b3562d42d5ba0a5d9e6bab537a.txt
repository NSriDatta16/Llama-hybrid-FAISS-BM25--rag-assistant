In algebraic topology, an area of mathematics, a homeotopy group of a topological space is a homotopy group of the group of self-homeomorphisms of that space.

Definition
The homotopy group functors  assign to each path-connected topological space  the group  of homotopy classes of continuous maps 

Another construction on a space  is the group of all self-homeomorphisms , denoted  If X is a locally compact, locally connected Hausdorff space then a fundamental result of R. Arens says that  will in fact be a topological group under the compact-open topology.

Under the above assumptions, the homeotopy groups for  are defined to be:

Thus  is the  mapping class group for  In other words, the  mapping class group is the set of connected components of  as specified by the functor

Example
According to the Dehn-Nielsen theorem, if  is a closed surface then  i.e., the zeroth homotopy group of the automorphisms of a space is the same as the outer automorphism group of its fundamental group.
