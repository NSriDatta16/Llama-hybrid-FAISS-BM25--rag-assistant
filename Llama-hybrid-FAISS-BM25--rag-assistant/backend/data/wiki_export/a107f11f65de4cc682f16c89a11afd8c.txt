The 1992–93 UEFA Cup was won by Juventus, who beat Borussia Dortmund 6–1 on aggregate in the final, a record score for a UEFA Cup final. It was the third victory in the competition for the Italian team (first club to reach this record).

Three seasons had now passed since the ban on English clubs in European competitions as a result of the Heysel disaster (1985) had been lifted, and for this campaign the number of English clubs in the competition was increased from one to two. English league runners-up Manchester United were joined by third placed Sheffield Wednesday, though both teams ultimately had a short-lived run in the competition. Poland earned one more seat, while Finland and Hungary lost one.

Ajax were the defending champions, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Auxerre.

Teams
East Germany ceased to participate as an independent association (having merged with the West German association due to the German reunification). This left UEFA one country short for the UEFA Cup, and therefore a new country (Slovenia) were given one spot.East Germany were no longer counted for the 1991 UEFA Country Ranking (decisive for the number of spots in the 1992–93 UEFA Cup). Turkey moved up to 21st place in that ranking and therefore were entitled to enter two clubs. Former Soviet Union now Community of Independent States had three places, and clubs qualified according to 1991 Soviet Top League, but after that UEFA recognized to Ukraine its own spot in the Cup Winners Cup, Chornomorets ceded their place in UEFA Cup to Dynamo Moscow.Albanian clubs were excluded from all competitions in the 1992-93 season which allowed Scotland to have three entries. 
Yugoslavia was disqualified after UN ban: UEFA awarded one of its two places to Romania, while the other one was given to Austria.
