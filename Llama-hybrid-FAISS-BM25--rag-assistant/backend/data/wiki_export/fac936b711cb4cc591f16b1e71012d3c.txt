The Notman Photographic Archives () is an archive of photographic images originally collected by photographer William Notman. It is conserved by the McCord Museum of Canadian History in Montreal, Quebec. Institutions and researchers worldwide consult the archives. Through its thousands of images—landscapes, well-known people, families, places, events, and activities—these historically invaluable archives provide a visual history of Montreal, Quebec and Canada from the 1840s to the present. As well as the iconographical data bank of 1,250,000 photographs, the archives include various items of early photographic equipment and accessories.
