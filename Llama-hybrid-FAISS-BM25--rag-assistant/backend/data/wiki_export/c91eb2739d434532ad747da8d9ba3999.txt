Early life
Born in London in 1960, Quin began playing the piano at the age of four. He was not from a musical family. He was offered a scholarship to study classical piano at the Royal College of Music, but he turned down the place in order to pursue his growing interests in improvisation, composition and music technology. By his early teens, he was accompanying silent movies, drumming in a rock band and regularly performing professional gigs.

Quin went on to study at Keele University, Staffordshire, where his final year dissertation was on the music of Earth, Wind and Fire. He graduated in Music and Electronics, having worked extensively with BAFTA-winning composer Tim Souster, as well as continuing his jazz interests with Cecil Lytle.

Quin has composed and recorded music for hundreds of television shows, films and adverts. The 1998 After Eight 'Perfect Dinner Party' advert, featured film of Liberace miming to Quin's piano playing. He now has well over one thousand published tracks.
