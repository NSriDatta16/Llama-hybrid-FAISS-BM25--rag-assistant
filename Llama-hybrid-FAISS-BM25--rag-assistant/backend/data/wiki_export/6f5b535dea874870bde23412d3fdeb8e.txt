Track listing

Notes
The songs "Needles" and "Burrito"  from this show were used as iTunes bonus tracks, because the record company did not want profanity on the retail version of the album.
"Needles" was later featured on the Masters of Horror II soundtrack, while "Burrito" was included on the Lost Boys: The Tribe soundtrack.

The DVD features an in-depth interview with the band as well as behind-the-scenes footage from their video shoot of "The Gift", among other features.

Personnel
 Shaun Morgan – lead vocals, rhythm guitar
 Dale Stewart – bass, backing vocals (lead guitar on "Broken")
