A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives for Kentucky's 98th Legislative District, which encompasses Greenup County, in 1975, and began his career in the General Assembly in 1976. He was elected to 11 consecutive terms — serving a total of 21 years — until he retired from office in 1996.
