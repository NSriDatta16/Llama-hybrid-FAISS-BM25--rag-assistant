History
A monastery is said to have been founded on Low Island by Saint Senan of Iniscattery, before Saint Patrick came into Munster.
Saint Moronoc is said to have had a cell here at the time of Senan's death, called "the Penitentiary of Inisluaidhe". There were many Danish forts and tumuli in the parish. The Moland Report of 1703 said of "Kildizert" that it "has on it ye ruins of an old church and several cabins." The ruins of the old church still remained in the burial-ground near the shore as of 1837.

In 1831 the population was 4,501, and in 1841 it was 5,130 in 753 houses.
In 1834 there were 4,802 Catholics and 32 Protestants. In 1837 the village contained about 60 houses, irregularly built. A steamboat passed daily on the way to or from Limerick. An application had also been made to the Board of Public Works to improve the Quay near Kildysart, from which pigs, corn, butter and agricultural produce were sent to Limerick in boats; and building material, groceries and other essentials were brought back in return.

Today
Kildysart has two minimarkets, hardware shops, a mobile bank, pharmacist, clinic, veterinary clinic, credit union, garage, community centre, four pubs and the Quay Marina. It has the parish church, St Michael's and St John Bosco Community College.

Kildysart is known for its fishing, both in the estuary and in the local lakes. Gortglass, Clonshnacta and Effernan, close to the village, are trout fishing lakes only. Only members of the local angling club are allowed to fish in them. Visitors can charter a boat for fishing in the Shannon Estuary or for trips to the islands. The estuary holds fish such as conger, skate, dogfish, pollock, flounder, tope and Thorn Back Ray, all of which can also be caught off Cahercon Pier, which is open to the public and is about  from Kildysart.
