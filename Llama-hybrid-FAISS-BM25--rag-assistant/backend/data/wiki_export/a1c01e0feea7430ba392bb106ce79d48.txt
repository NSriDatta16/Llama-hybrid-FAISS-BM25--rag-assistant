Rotuma Communal is a former electoral division of Fiji, the sole communal constituency reserved for citizens of Rotuman descent. Established by the 1997 Constitution, it came into being in 1999 and was used for the parliamentary elections of 1999, 2001, and 2006. Its boundaries encompassed the entire nation; Rotuman-descendants anywhere in Fiji were eligible to vote for, and be a candidate for, this constituency. (Of the remaining 70 seats, 45 were reserved for other ethnic communities and 25, called Open Constituencies, were elected by universal suffrage).

The 2013 Constitution promulgated by the Military-backed interim government abolished all constituencies and established a form of proportional representation, with the entire country voting as a single electorate.
