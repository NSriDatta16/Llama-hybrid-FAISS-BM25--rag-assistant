Geography

Lázně Bělohrad is located about  northwest of Jičín and  northeast of Prague. It lies mostly in the Jičín Uplands.

The Javorka River flows through the town. There are several small ponds around the town.

History
The today's town was created from the settlement Nová Ves, first mentioned in 1354. In the 16th century, a new fortress was established nearby and was called Bělohrad after its white walls (derived from Bílý hrad, meaning "White Castle"). In 1626–1643, it was owned by Albrecht von Wallenstein. During the rule of Guillaume de Lamboy, the village was settled by German colonists. From 1669, it was again acquired by the Waldstein family. In 1722, it was promoted to a market town by Charles VI, and Nová Ves became a part of Bělohrad.

In 1871, the railway was built and Bělohrad developed rapidly. In 1880, the spa (, now part of the town's name) was founded, and in 1885, first spa buildings were built.

Sights

The Bělohrad Castle was a Renaissance castle built around 1550. It was rebuilt around 1721, probably by Jan Santini Aichel. The castle is surrounded by a freely accessible castle park. In the park is located Memorial to Karel Václav Rais, who is the most notable native. The memorial is located in the Empire style building of the former orangery, which dates from 1831. In the memorial there is a museum with an exhibition about the life and work of Rais, and about the history of the town.

The Church of All Saints was first documented in 1354. In 1689–1700, it was replaced by the current early Baroque building.
