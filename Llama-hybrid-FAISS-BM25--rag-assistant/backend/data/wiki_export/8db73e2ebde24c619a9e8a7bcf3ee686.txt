The National Hockey League's Southeast Division was formed in 1998 as part of the Eastern Conference due to expansion. The division lasted for 14 seasons (not including the cancelled 2004–05 season) until 2013. The division was intended to group teams primarily in the Southeastern United States. Its original members were the Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Washington Capitals. The expansion Atlanta Thrashers joined the division in 1999. The Thrashers' relocation to Winnipeg in 2011 to become the new Winnipeg Jets spurred talks for what became a league realignment in 2013; the Jets still played in the Southeast during the division's final two seasons.
