In 1990, Bell became assistant director of education at Newcastle City Council. During this time he spent a year as a Harkness Fellow at Georgia State University, Atlanta, studying education and local government reform across the United States of America. Bell trained as an Ofsted team inspector in 1993. He became a Registered Inspector in 1994 and carried out inspections in primary schools.

University of Reading 

In September 2012, Bell left the civil service to become the vice-chancellor of the University of Reading. He succeeded Acting Vice-Chancellor Tony Downes.

In 2016 a move to reorganise the structure of Reading University provoked student protests. On 21 March 2016, staff announced a vote of no confidence in Bell, the no-confidence motion being backed by 88% of those who voted.

Bell left the University of Reading in September 2018 and was succeeded by Robert Van de Noort as acting vice-chancellor. Bell had left "under a cloud", according to Times Higher Education when it emerged that Reading had returned a Â£20 million deficit, largely because of its Malaysia campus.
