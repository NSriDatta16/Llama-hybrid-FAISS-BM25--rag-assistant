Suffren was the first vessel of the second group of 8-inch gunned, 10,000 ton Treaty Cruisers built for La Marine Nationale. She spent the interwar period with the two Duquesne-class cruisers until she was sent to French Indochina. Upon her return to the Mediterranean she rejoined the Duquesnes at Alexandria. She was interned there with the other units of the French Navy. She returned to the War in 1943 spending her time based at Dakar on blockade patrol. Post war she aided in the return of the French to Indochina until placed in reserve in 1947. In reserve she was used as a training hulk and barracks ship at Brest. She was renamed Océan in 1963 and finally stricken in 1972.

She was named in honour of Admiral Pierre André de Suffren, who is considered by some historians to be the French version of Horatio Nelson. Serving under Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing's fleet off North America and the West Indies from 1778 to 1779, the area of his most significant engagements were against the Royal Navy in the Indian Ocean between 1782 and 1783. She was the sixth vessel to bear his name.

Design and description
She was ordered on the 1 November 1925 as a croiseurs legers (light cruiser) from the Arsenal de Brest (Brest Naval Yard). She would be nearly identical to the s with a few visible changes. Her bridge would be raised above the conning tower and would be accessible by an exposed ladder. She would have two catapults between the aft funnel and the mainmast. Her armament would be identical. Her overall length would be four meters longer due to the redesign of her stern but her hull volume would be the same. She would have a shallow armoured belt over her machinery spaces. She was laid down on 17 April 1926 at Brest with her hull designated as Number 54 and launched on 3 May 1927. She fitted out and was ready for her sea trials on 20 August 1928.  Her acceptance trials would follow on 20 December 1928. She was commissioned on 1 May 1929 though she would not be completed until 1 January 1930.

Initially classed as a Light Cruiser, she was reclassified on 1 July 1931 as a croiseur de 1ere classe (First class cruiser). The Marine Nationale did not have a vessel classification of heavy cruiser, instead used croiseur cuirasse (armoured cruiser) and croiseurs legers (light cruiser) prior to the London Naval Treaty and then croiseur de 1ere classe (First class cruiser) and croiseur de 2e classe (Second class cruiser) afterwards
