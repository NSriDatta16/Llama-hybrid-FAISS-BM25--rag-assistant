Erewhon is David Thomas and Two Pale Boys' debut album, as well as Thomas' first record outside the Pere Ubu banner since that group's reformation in 1987. The Two Pale Boys are a duo consisting of Keith Moliné on guitar and Andy Diagram on trumpet and other instruments.

Critical reception
The Chicago Reader wrote that the trio "create a sparser and more spontaneous format that allows Thomas to do his thing; their improvised accompaniment encompasses elements of techno, garage rock, and sea chanteys." The Los Angeles Times deemed the album "a veritable cacophony" and "heartily irritating." The Santa Fe New Mexican concluded that it "sounds pretty much like vintage Ubu without a rhythm section."
