David Miller (November 28, 1909 – April 14, 1992) was an American film director who directed varied films such as Billy the Kid (1941) with Robert Taylor and Brian Donlevy, Flying Tigers (1943) with John Wayne, and Love Happy (1949) with the Marx Brothers.

Emanuel Levy wrote in 2009 that Lonely are the Brave (1962), starring Kirk Douglas, "is the most accomplished film of David Miller, who directs with eloquent feeling for landscape and attention to character." Others feel that Miller's best is his 1952 noir thriller and Joan Crawford vehicle Sudden Fear co-starring Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame. Sudden Fear was nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Actress (Crawford), Best Actor (Palance), Best Costume Design and Best Cinematography by Charles Lang but was a box office failure.
