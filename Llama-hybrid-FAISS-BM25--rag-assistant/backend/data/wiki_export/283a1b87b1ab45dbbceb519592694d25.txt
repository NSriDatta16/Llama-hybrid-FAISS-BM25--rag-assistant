French Kiss is the solo debut by former Fleetwood Mac singer/guitarist Bob Welch. The songs, with the exception of "Sentimental Lady", were intended for a projected third album by Welch's previous band, Paris. However, the group fell apart in 1977 before recording could begin. So instead, Welch used these songs for his debut solo album.

History 
The album produced three hit singles: "Ebony Eyes" (with backing vocals by Juice Newton) peaking at number 14 in the US; a revised version of Fleetwood Mac's"Sentimental Lady", peaking at number 8; and "Hot Love, Cold World", which peaked at number 31.

The album itself peaked at number 12 in the US and later went platinum. It is Welch's best-selling album.

The album features guest appearances by former Fleetwood Mac bandmates Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie and Welch's successor, Lindsey Buckingham.
