Cruel Melody is the debut album of American rock band Black Light Burns, released on June 5, 2007, through Ross Robinson's label I AM: WOLFPACK. The album is an outcome of frontman Wes Borland's efforts after his departure from Limp Bizkit in 2001, after which he took part in many projects such as Eat the Day and The Damning Well. After receiving additional inputs from then members Danny Lohner, Josh Freese and Josh Eustis, Cruel Melody was released in the spring of 2007.

Background
Wes Borland began writing in early 2004 a solo album of mainly melodic and esoteric material after he disbanded his projects such as Big Dumb Face, Eat the Day and The Damning Well but slightly before he rejoined Limp Bizkit in mid-2004. During this time Borland was offered the touring guitarist spot in Nine Inch Nails, and frontman Trent Reznor offered his opinions on the material as it was at the time. He encouraged Borland to "not sing like someone was asleep in the next room" and make it a heavier affair, while coincidentally Borland was changing the material slowly more into that. While the songs were written by Borland, he did have additional input from producer Danny Lohner, drummer Josh Freese (both ex-members of The Damning Well) and the keyboards and additional engineering were assisted by Josh Eustis.

The song "I Have a Need" was instrumentally written to be included on the Limp Bizkit release The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), but was cut in order for the EP to remain mostly metal oriented. It features Limp Bizkit's bassist Sam Rivers on the track, and Borland was allowed to use the song for Black Light Burns when the song was turned down for use by Limp Bizkit.

Release and promotion
Cruel Melody was released on June 5, 2007, selling 6,000 copies in its first week in  the US according to Indiehq.com.

Black Light Burns toured extensively in America, starting slightly before the album release and for about the next year and a half, doing headline dates, music festivals, and opening for Sevendust. There were difficulties in shows being under promoted, but the band persisted. The touring in support for the album was documented professionally, and released on the bonus DVD to the band's then upcoming cover's album, Cover Your Heart and the Anvil Pants Odyssey.

The song "Lie" served as the first single from the album, going to radio on March 20. A music video was released soon after this. The tracks "4 Walls" and "Animal" are used in Season 2 of TV series Burn Notice. The track "Stop a Bullet" is used in the launch trailer for the videogame Ghost Recon: Future Soldier.

On July 13, 2007 Black Light Burns was featured on the late night talk show Last Call with Carson Daly where they performed "Lie."

Reception

Allmusic writer Greg Prato wrote a positive review, stating: "For many, Borland was the only Limp Bizkit member who was taken seriously. As evidenced by Cruel Melody, he is now officially allowed to follow whichever musical path he so desires."
