Yuan Weishi (; born December 15, 1931) is a Chinese historian and philosopher.

Biography
Yuan was born in Xingning, Guangdong. He was admitted to Zhongshan University Department of Economics in 1950, and then went to a master program in political economy at Fudan University. He worked as a faculty member at Zhongshan University Department of Philosophy.

In the January 2006 issue of Freezing Point, Yuan published an essay titled  Modernisation and History Textbooks, criticizing the official theme of government issued middle schools history textbooks, claiming that they contain numbers of distortions of the historical accounts (see for example in the article about the Boxer Rebellion). Professor Yuan said:"The public, especially the students, have the right to find out the true historical facts."
