History

An ancient Finno-Ugric Meri trading settlement and a wooden hill fortress once existed on the site of modern Manturovo, at the confluence of the Unzha and Mezha Rivers. The name means Mantu = Podzol, Rova = higher place in sparsely coniferous forest. According to its name it have had a Saame or Nenents roots. Finno-Ugrian Rova derives from Saame (Sami) word Roavve which means hill or open place as result of forest fire. Thus the place was inhabited at least c. 2000 BCE. It became a Meri settlement by c. 300 CE and remained such until at least the 14th century.

The Russian village of Manturovo was first mentioned in 1617. Later on, it grew into a town and was granted town status in 1958.

Administrative and municipal status
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Manturovo serves as the administrative center of Manturovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Manturovo—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Manturovo is incorporated as Manturovo Urban Okrug.

Manturovo was connected by St. Petersburg–Vyatka Railway to Vyatka and Perm in 1908. Since then it has developed from quiet country village railway station to a forest industry center including a big plywood factory. A Finnish forest company has plans to open a big modern forest industry center to Manturovo, nearly a billion euro investment, if Russian government guarantee its legal ownership according to the WTO standards.
