Philippe  Gaubert (5 July 1879 – 8 July 1941) was a French musician who was a distinguished performer on the flute, a respected conductor, and a composer, primarily for the flute.

Biography
Gaubert – commonly referred to as Gauberto – was born in Cahors but moved to Paris with his parents when he was six. His mother, who worked as a housekeeper, occasionally cleaned the apartment of Paul Taffanel, who began teaching Philippe the flute. Taffanel was Professor of Flute at the Paris Conservatoire, and Gaubert began studying there in 1893, aged 13.<ref>'Philippe Gaubert (1879-1941), Chamber Music'. at MusicWeb International</ref> 

He became one of the most prominent French musicians between the two World Wars. After a prominent career as a flautist with the Paris Opéra, he was appointed in 1919, at the age of forty, to three positions that placed him at the very centre of French musical life: 
 Professor of flute in the Conservatoire de Paris (teacher of Marcel Moyse)
 Principal conductor of the Paris Opéra
 Principal conductor of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire

In 1907, he participated in the first performance of Maurice Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet. Among his recordings as conductor, one that he made of César Franck's Symphony in D minor (with the Conservatoire forces) is particularly notable.

In 1941, Gaubert died of a stroke in Paris.

Legacy
 Gaubert's playing can be heard on a series of recordings for the French Gramophone Company in 1919.
 His Méthode complète for flute, a collaboration with Taffanel, was published in 1923.
 Journalist Jean Bouzerand, Gaubert's friend, convinced the town of Cahors to create a public garden in Gaubert's honour near the river Lot in the late 1930s.
 When Gaubert was still alive, Albert Roussel dedicated the movement "Monsieur de la Péjaudie" in his piece Joueurs de flûte, op. 27 for flute and piano to him.

Honours
Gaubert was appointed Chevalier de la Legion d'honneur in 1921.
