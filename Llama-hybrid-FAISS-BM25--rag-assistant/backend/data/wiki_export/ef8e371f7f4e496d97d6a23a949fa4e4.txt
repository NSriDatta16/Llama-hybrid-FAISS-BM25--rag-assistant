Laynce Michael Nix (born October 30, 1980) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. Nix played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers, Milwaukee Brewers, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Nationals, and Philadelphia Phillies. Nix played all three outfield positions, as well as first base, but was officially listed as a left fielder by ESPN. His younger brother, Jayson Nix, also has played in MLB.

Early life
Nix grew up in the suburbs of Dallas and was home schooled by his mother. A fan of the Texas Rangers, Nix commented that during his childhood: "We'd do some studies in the morning, my brother and I, and then we'd watch the Cubs every day at 1:00. My brother and I would go out in the backyard and imitate what we saw, which was Ryne Sandberg, Andre Dawson, and that crew ... we had a good time." Eventually, he went to public school and attended Midland High, where he played football and was the team's starting quarterback, but baseball was his "first love", and the Rangers drafted him in the fourth round after his senior year in high school.
