Loverboy Classics is a compilation album by the Canadian rock band Loverboy, released on October 11, 1994. In 1998, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments of half a million copies.

The album covered more ground than the previous compilation album Big Ones, and outsold it by far as well. It still does not contain their 1983 #34 U.S. hit "Queen of the Broken Hearts".
