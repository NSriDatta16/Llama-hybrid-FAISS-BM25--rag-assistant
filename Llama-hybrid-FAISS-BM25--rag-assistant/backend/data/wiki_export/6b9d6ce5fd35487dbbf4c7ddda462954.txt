The Mīqāt Dhu al-Ḥulayfah (), also known as Masjid ash-Shajarah () or Masjid Dhu al-Hulayfah (), is a miqat and mosque in Abyār ʿAlī, Medina, west of Wadi al-'Aqiq, where the final Islamic prophet, Muhammad, entered the state of ihram before performing 'Umrah, after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. The mosque is located  SW of the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and was defined by Muhammad as the miqat for those willing to perform the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages from Medina. It is the second-largest miqat mosque after the Miqat Qarn al-Manazil in As-Sayl al-Kabir.

History 

Dhu al-Hulayfah was defined as the miqat for the people of Medina by Muhammad in the hadith in Sahih Bukhari, Book 25, Hadith 14, which was narrated by Ibn 'Abbas:"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had fixed Dhul Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina..."The mosque was first built during the time of Umar II ibn 'Abdulaziz, who was the Umayyad governor of Medina from 706-712 (87-93 AH) and has been renovated several times since, the last major renovation being during the reign of King Fahd (), who increased the area of the mosque by many times its original size and added several modern facilities.
