Enrollment and graduation rates
In November 2006, the district had an enrollment of 2,596 students. In May 2015, the district had an enrollment of 2,791 students.

The school district implemented a plan in 2013-2014, referred to as the Student Achievement Initiative (SAI), that within 8 years of graduating, 60% of the students would receive a degree or certification from a technical training program or college. To achieve the goal, all seniors in high school were to submit an application for acceptance to Centralia College. Coupled with field trips to Centralia College, this allowed the district to achieve high rates of graduation, college admission, and career opportunities for the students. Officials and teachers in elementary and middle schools created programs to emphasize future college and employment opportunities by holding job assemblies, "swag days" for local and state schools of technical and university education, and "college-themed days".

The graduation rate for students at W.F. West High School in 2010 was 77%, with 33% of those students achieving admission into a university or training school. In 2018, 73% of seniors who graduated went on to further higher education. Starting in 2019, a four-year stretch of 100% of graduating senior classes were accepted into college. In 2019, the four-year graduation rate was 95%, bettering the state average by 14 points. The rate increased to 96% in 2022.

Funding
The SAI was originally funded by donations from the community, including a $10 million contribution from Orin C. Smith, who graduated from the high school in 1960. The fund is perpetual, and is able to pay out $500,000 per year.

The district, in 2022, was awarded a grant of over $1,000,000 from the Washington Student Achievement Council. The funds are to be used to reach out to parents and young children, particularly at-risk students.
