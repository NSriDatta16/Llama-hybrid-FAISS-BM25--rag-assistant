The Summertime Oaks is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in June at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California. The Grade II event is open to three-year-old fillies willing to race on dirt at a distance of one and one-sixteenth miles. The race was inaugurated in 1946 as the Hollywood Oaks and was originally run at Hollywood Park Racetrack.

Following the closure of Hollywood Park in 2013, the race was transferred to Santa Anita Park. At the same time, the purse was increased from $150,000 to $200,000.

Since inception, the race has been contested at various distances:
 1 mile : 1946, 1948–1950
 7 furlongs : 1947
  miles : 1951–1953, 2002–present
  miles : 1954-2001
