Reginald Lindesay-Bethune, 12th Earl of Lindsay, JP, DL (18 May 1867 – 14 January 1939), known as Viscount Garnock from 1894-1917, was a Scottish nobleman and British Army officer.

The eldest son of David Clarke Bethune, 11th Earl of Lindsay (1832–1917) and Emily Marian Crosse, he succeeded his father as the 12th Earl of Lindsay upon his death in 1917, and assumed the additional surname of Lindsay in 1919.

Lord Garnock was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 8th Hussars on 16 November 1887, promoted to lieutenant on 5 June 1889, and to captain on 30 July 1894. He served with the regiment in South Africa in 1901–1902 during the Second Boer War, and was promoted major on 19 October 1901. The war ended in June 1902, and Lord Garnock stayed in South Africa until December that year, when he left on the SS Kinfauns Castle. He later served with the East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry.

Lord Garnock was unsuccessful Conservative parliamentary candidate for Buckrose, East Yorkshire, in 1906. He was a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords from 1917. He was also Master of Fife Fox Hounds.

Garnock married Beatrice Mary, daughter of John Shaw of Welburn Hall, Yorkshire, but had no issue. His younger brother, Archibald Bethune, 13th Earl of Lindsay, succeeded him to the earldom upon his death in 1939.
