Cult is the third studio album by Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica, released in 2000, with a special edition issued in 2001 that includes an extra disc, mixed and mastered at Finnvox. Apocalyptica's first two albums consisted mostly of cover songs. Cult was their first album to feature mainly original compositions, along with using distortion effects much more boldly and frequently, which gave the album a more orchestral sound. The record also experimented with vocals and other instrumentation. There are some versions of the first release with "Path Vol. 2" as the first track and "Path" as the fourteenth. This is the last Apocalyptica album to feature Max Lilja on cello. The song "Hope Vol. 2" has a music video that features scenes from the film Vidocq. Cult, along with Inquisition Symphony and Live, were bundled together in a limited edition collectors box set, issued in 2003.
