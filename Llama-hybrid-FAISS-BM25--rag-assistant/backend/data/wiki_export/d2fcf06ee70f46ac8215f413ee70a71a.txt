Leci Brandão (, Rio de Janeiro, September 12, 1944) is a Brazilian politician, singer and composer of Brazilian Popular Music (Música Popular Brasileira or MPB). She is the daughter of Pérola Negra, one of the artists who pioneered in making the Brazilian pagode music popular throughout the land.  Her performance of "Quero Sim" won the National Meeting of Samba Composers in 1973.

One of Leci Brandão's latest performances was in 2005 with Raça Brasileira: 20 Anos (DVD: 'Raca Brasileira', rated NR, one hour/2005) with many other Brazilian samba greats (i.e. Beth Carvalho, Arlindo Cruz, Almir Guineto, etc.).

As a Black Brazilian, a woman, and an artist, Leci Brandão has long taken opportunities to declare herself against racism and all other forms of discrimination. She has lent her name, voice and cache by performing in LGBT events against homophobia. In the 2012 carnival, she was honored by the Escola de samba Académicos del Tatuapé.

Political career 
In February 2010, Leci Brandão joined the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) and ran for State Representative for the state of São Paulo, being elected with over 85,000 votes, reelected in 2014 with 71,000 votes, in 2018 with over 64,000, and in 2022 with 90,496 votes. With her last re-election, Leci became the first black woman to serve 4 consecutive terms in the history of ALESP.

As a parliamentarian, Leci Brandão claims to be dedicated to promoting racial equality, respect for religions of African matrix, and Brazilian culture. The second black congresswoman in the history of the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo (the first was Dr. Theodosina Rosário Ribeiro), Leci also raises the issue of indigenous and quilombola populations, youth, women, and the LGBTQ+ segment.

And in 2019, Leci was one of the deputies to sign the PL of the project "Menstruation without taboo", which aimed to combat menstrual poverty through the distribution of pads for women in poverty along the lines of countries like Scotland.
