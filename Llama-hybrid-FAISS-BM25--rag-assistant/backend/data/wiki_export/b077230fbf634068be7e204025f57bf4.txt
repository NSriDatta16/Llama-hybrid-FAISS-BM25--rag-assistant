Campaign for lieutenant governor
On November 14, 2005, Roberts announced her candidacy for Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. Her primary opponents included the incumbent Catherine Baker Knoll; William Hall III, a building contractor; and Gene Stilp, an anti-pay raise activist. Knoll had had the advantage of being endorsed by the State Democratic Committee, while few elected officials endorsed Roberts. Some progressive and liberal circles and groups, annoyed by Knoll's social conservatism, supported Roberts. Supporters of Ms. Roberts said she not only offered geographical, racial, and gender balance to a potential Rendell-Roberts ticket but had the ability and courage to bring about changes and reforms in Harrisburg. Her main campaign issues and themes were health care and education. Mrs. Roberts received endorsements from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily and Sunday Review, Pittsburgh City Councilman Bill Peduto, Penn State Democrats, and Pennsylvania's two main pro-choice groups, Pennsylvania National Organization for Women and Pennsylvania Planned Parenthood.

On primary day, Roberts came in second to Knoll, with 139,585 votes to Knoll's 438,287.

Campaign for Allegheny County Controller
Roberts was a candidate for the 2011 Democratic nomination for the Allegheny County controller's office. Roberts lost the primary to Chelsa Wagner, who went on to win the office in the general election.
