Stash Tea Company is a privately owned specialty tea and herbal tea company headquartered in Tigard, a suburb of Portland in Oregon, USA.

History 

Stash Tea was founded by Steve Lee, Dave Leger, and Steven Smith (who also co-founded Steven Smith Teamaker and founded Tazo) in 1972. The company originally operated from an old Victorian style house in Portland, supplying loose herbal teas and bulk herbs to natural food stores. Stash Tea broadened its focus to include bagged teas, and a full line of traditional, specialty blend herbal teas for fine restaurants.

According to the company, Stash Tea derives its name from tea folklore: tea was once a valuable commodity, traditionally transported by clipper ships. A shipâ€™s captain was typically presented with the finest teas for his personal use, which was regarded as his stash.

In 1993, Stash was acquired by Yamamotoyama Tea Company.
