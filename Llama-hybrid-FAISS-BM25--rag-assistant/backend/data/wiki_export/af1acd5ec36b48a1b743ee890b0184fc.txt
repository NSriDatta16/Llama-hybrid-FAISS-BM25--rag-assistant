History 
The Canadian Pacific Railway Station was built in 1909, when the area was officially named Bearspaw. The origin of the name derives from the head of the Stoney Nations, Chief Masgwaahsid, also known as Bears Paw. Masgwaahsid is famous for his significance as a delegate along with other First Nations people for when they met with representatives of the Queen of Britain on the 22nd September 1877 to sign Treaty No.7. There was a total of five different First Nations tribes involved these were, Stoney-Nakoda, Piikani (Peigan), Kainnai (Blood), Tsuut'ina (Sarcee) and the Siksika (Blackfoot). The treaty included terms which agreed to portions of land given to the native people, varying on the size of each family, payments were also made to every individual, both immediately and annually. The government also provided tools and cattle to each family.

Dairy farmers initially established the location of Bearspaw. It wasn't until 1920 when Bearspaw had its first schoolhouse constructed, containing a single classroom which was functional for forty-five years until being closed in 1965.
