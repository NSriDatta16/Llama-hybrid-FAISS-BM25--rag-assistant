Dausgaard studied conducting at the Royal Academy of Music in Copenhagen and with Norman Del Mar at the Royal College of Music in London. He subsequently participated in conducting masterclasses with Franco Ferrara, Leonard Bernstein and Hiroyuki Iwaki. 

In Scandinavia, Dausgaard became chief conductor of the Swedish Chamber Orchestra from 1997. From 2001 to 2004, he was Principal Guest Conductor of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra (DNSO), and became Chief Conductor in 2004, the first Danish conductor to hold the post.

He became the symphony's music director in the 2019–2020 season, with a 4 season contract. However, on 3 January 2022, Dausgaard resigned from the Seattle Symphony via e-mail, with immediate effect, citing a hostile work environment with the Seattle Symphony organisation. 

In March 2015, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO) announced the appointment of Dausgaard as its next Chief Conductor, effective with the 2016–2017 season.  In January 2018, the BBC SSO announced the extension of Dausgaard's contract as Chief Conductor through the 2021–2022 season.
