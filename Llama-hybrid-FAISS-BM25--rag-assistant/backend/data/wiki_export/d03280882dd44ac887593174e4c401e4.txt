The Korn Ferry Tour Championship presented by United Leasing & Finance is the year-end golf tournament of the Korn Ferry Tour. It has been played at a variety of courses; starting in 2019 it will be played at Victoria National Golf Club in Newburgh, Indiana as part of a 10-year deal. Since the 2008 edition, the purse has been $1,000,000, with the winner receiving $180,000.

The format of the tournament is stroke play at 18 holes for four days, a total of 72 holes. Originally, the field consisted of the top 60 players on the money list, all attempting to be among the 25 to earn PGA Tour cards. Since 2013, it has been part of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals and the field consists of the top 75 players from the Korn Ferry Tour money list and the non-exempt players ranked 126 to 200 on the PGA Tour's money list at the start of the Finals. From 2013 to 2022, 50 PGA Tour cards were be awarded after the event. 

The format changed in 2023 where thirty PGA Tour cards are awarded at the end of the season. Those in the top 75 are given entry into the Tour Championship and are guaranteed at minimum full Korn Ferry Tour status.
