Jane Cathcart, daughter of Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart, and baptized on 17 July 1778. However, his older brother died in childhood, leaving him as heir to the family titles and estates, and from then until his father's death in 1830 he was known by the courtesy title of Marquess of Tullibardine. He was educated at Eton and in 1797 was commissioned as an ensign into the 61st Regiment of Foot. However, in 1798 he was declared of "unsound mind".

He was succeeded by his nephew George Murray, the son of the Duke's younger brother James Murray, 1st Baron Glenlyon (1782–1837) The baron had managed the family and ducal affairs on behalf of his older brother following their father's death.
