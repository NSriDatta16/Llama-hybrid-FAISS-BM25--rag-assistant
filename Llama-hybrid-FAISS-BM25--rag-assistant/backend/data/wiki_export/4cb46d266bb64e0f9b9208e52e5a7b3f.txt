Swat Museum of Saidu Sharif

Swat Museum is located on the eastern side of the G.T. road, equidistant between Mingora and Saidu Sharif. Aided by Japanese contributions, the museum has undergone a rejuvenation to its seven galleries. These galleries now contain compilation of Gandhara sculptures taken from various Buddhist sites within Swat. The galleries have been reorganized and accompanied by informative labels, effectively depicting the narrative of Buddha's life journey.

The Swat Museum also hosts an array of artifacts that offer a glimpse into the ancient Gandhara Civilsation.

In the last few years, Swat has seen great changes in all aspects of its society including an increase in education, modern health care centers and a new university, along with private sector colleges.

Archeological sites

One of the most important Buddhist relics in Swat is near the museum. The stupa, which dates from the second century BC, was possibly built by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to house some of the ashes of the Buddha. In subsequent centuries, it was enlarged five times by encasing the existing structure in a new shell.

Italian excavators working in 1955, exposed the successive layers of the stupa, each layer illustrating a stage in the evolution of building techniques.
