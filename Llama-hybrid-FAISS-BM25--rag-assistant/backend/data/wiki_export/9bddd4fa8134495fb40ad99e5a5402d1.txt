Early and personal life

1936 Winter Olympics 
Because he was Jewish, Ball was initially denied inclusion on the German ice hockey team for the 1936 Winter Olympics at a time of Jewish persecution by the Nazi government. However, his friend and teammate Gustav Jaenecke refused to play unless Ball was included. Ball struck a deal to save his family in Germany if he returned to play in the games. The German authorities also realized that without Ball and Jaenecke, the team would not stand a chance of winning. When the Olympics opened, Ball was one of two Jewish athletes to represent Germany, along with Helene Mayer. One report at the time proposed that Ball was playing against his will. After Ball was injured, the Germans took fifth place. Ball played in four games and scored two goals.
