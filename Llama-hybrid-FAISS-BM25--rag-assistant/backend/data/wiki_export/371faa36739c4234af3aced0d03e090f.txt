Bryon Donald Baltimore  (born August 26, 1952) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, who played in the NHL and WHA.

Baltimore started his hockey career playing two seasons for the University of Alberta. He then joined the AHL's Springfield Kings. He was called up by the Los Angeles Kings for the 1974 playoffs but he did not see any ice time. In 1974, he signed with the Chicago Cougars of the WHA, and he played in the WHA until it folded. In the ensuing dispersal draft, he was picked up by the Edmonton Oilers, with whom he played two games in the 1979â€“80 season. Baltimore is one of only three Yukon-raised players to participate in an NHL game, the others being Jarrett Deuling and Dylan Cozens. 

After his hockey career ended, Baltimore became a litigation lawyer in Edmonton, Alberta, practicing at McCuaig Desrochers LLP where he serves as managing partner. Baltimore coached the now defunct Montana Magic in 1983-84 in the CHL. Team had 20/52/4 record. The league folded after this season.
