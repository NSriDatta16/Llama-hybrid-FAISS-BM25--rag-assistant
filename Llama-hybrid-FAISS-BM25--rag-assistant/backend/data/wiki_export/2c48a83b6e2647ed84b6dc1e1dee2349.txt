The Melville Millionaires are a Canadian junior "A" ice hockey based in Melville, Saskatchewan.  They are members of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League (SJHL).  They play their home games in the Horizon Credit Union Centre which has a seating capacity of 2,100. The Melville Millionaires and the Yorkton Terriers are archrivals. The team colours are blue and white. Games are broadcast on radio station CJGX AM 940. The Millionaires also fielded a senior hockey team in the 1910s, which won the 1915 Allan Cup.

History

An earlier edition of the Melville Millionaires played senior hockey during the 1910s in the Southern Saskatchewan Hockey League, winning the league championship in 1915 and taking over the title of Allan Cup champions. The team subsequently won two challenges but lost the final challenge of the season to the Winnipeg Monarchs.
 
Future National Hockey League all-star Ron Hextall was a member of the Millionaires during the 1980–81 season.  On February 27, 1981, Hextall faced 105 shots against the five-time league champion Prince Albert Raiders in a 21–2 loss.  The game reporter said "Hextall was Brilliant..." through his 84-save effort, claiming the "score could have gone up to 34 or 35."
