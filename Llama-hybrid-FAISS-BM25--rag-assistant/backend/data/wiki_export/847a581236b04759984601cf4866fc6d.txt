The acquisitions on Île Jésus was to carry out a similar project along the Rivière des Mille Îles, with Montreal residents as their main clients.

A summer village, consisting mainly of chalets built near a beach, was set up by the company, and named of Plage-Laval, borrowing the name of the county of Laval, in which the sector is located. On February 19, 1932, Plage-Laval changed its status to become a city under the Act to incorporate the town of Plage Laval. It created a Bilingual Council, and elected Mr. Taillon as Mayor. The permanent population of the town was 281 residents, with an influx of over 5000 summer vacationers.

In 1950, Plage-Laval enlarged its territory by annexing, on both sides of present-day Boulevard Arthur-Sauvé, part of the territory of the municipality of the parish of Sainte-Rose, situated to the south of boulevard Sainte-Rose.

On 1 January 1951, the municipality changed its name to that of the city of Laval-Ouest. The 1952 census placed the population of the city with 731 French families, 494 English families, 236 Jewish families, and 66 other. In 1960, responding to the citizens' request, the town of Laval-Ouest annexed part of the territory of the municipality of the parish of Sainte-Dorothée, in particular between Boulevard Dagenais and chemin Saint-Antoine, and another Small part of the territory of the city of Fabreville.
