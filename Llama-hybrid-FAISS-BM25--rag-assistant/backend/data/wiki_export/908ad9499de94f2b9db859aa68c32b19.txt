The Quesnel Millionaires were a junior "A" ice hockey team based in Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada. They were members of the Interior Conference of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). They played their home games at Quesnel Twin Arena. The ownership group accepted an offer from the Chiefs Development group to move them to Chilliwack to play in Prospera Centre as of 2011 which was vacated after the Chilliwack Bruins were sold and moved to Victoria, BC.  They are now known as the Chilliwack Chiefs.

History

The Millionaires started out in the Peace Cariboo Junior Hockey League in 1975. The Millionaires are the 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1987 PCJHL Champions. They have also won the 1977, 1978, and 1979 Cyclone Taylor Cup Championships.  In 1978, the Millionaires also won the Western Canada Junior B championship, defeating the North Saskatchewan Junior B Hockey League's Saskatoon Quakers 2-games-to-none. In 1996, the Millionaires moved to the British Columbia Hockey League.

On May 9, 2011, the BCHL approved the sale of the Quesnel Millionaires to the Chiefs Development Group in Chilliwack, BC.  The former Chiefs franchise was renamed the Langley Rivermen in preparation for the Millionaires' return to Chilliwack.
