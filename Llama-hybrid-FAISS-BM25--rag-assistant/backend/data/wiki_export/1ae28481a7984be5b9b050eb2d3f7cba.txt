History 
The station was originally opened by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway on 9 July 1929 on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway.

The station is currently fully operational, with a part-time booking office. It is an intermediate station on the Glasgow Central â€“ Neilston line. The railway was electrified in the early 1960s and  "Blue Train" electric multiple units provided almost all trains services for many years thereafter. Until late 2019, services were primarily operated by ageing Class 314 EMUs, until a few months before their withdrawal.

As a cost-saving measure, the three stations south of Williamwood (i.e. Neilston, Patterton and Whitecraigs) were considered for possible closure in 1983 by the Strathclyde PTE but were reprieved.

Services 
Services are now operated mainly by 4 car Class 380/1 EMUs, with the 3 coach Class 318 EMUs and Class 320 EMUs working together to provide 6 coach services at peak times. Two trains an hour operate in each direction calling all stops from Glasgow Central to Neilston. Additionally, additional peak time services operate between Central and Neilston, calling only from Muirend through to the terminus.
