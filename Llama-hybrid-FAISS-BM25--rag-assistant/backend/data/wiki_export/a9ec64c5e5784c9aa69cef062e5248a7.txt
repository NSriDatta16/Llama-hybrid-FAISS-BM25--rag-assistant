Bass Masters Classic is a 1995 fishing video game from Malibu Games, developed by Chicago-based studio Black Pearl Software.

Reception

Game Informer game the SNES version of the game a score of 8.25 out of 10, stating:" would've liked to see more terrain beneath the surface, but maybe that's for a sequel. Bassmasters is a quality fishin' cart, so if you like Black Bass this one is worth some play time".
