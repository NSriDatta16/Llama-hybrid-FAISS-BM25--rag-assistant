The Johannesburg South Africa Temple is the 36th operating temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

History
In April 1981, LDS Church leaders announced the building of a temple in Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa. Groundbreaking took place on 27 November 1982. Once the site of estates built by nineteenth-century mining magnates and financiers, the area around the temple now features hospitals, office buildings, and schools, many of which are housed in mansions from the Victorian era.

The temple is visible from many parts of the city with its six spires reaching into the sky. The edges of the building are finished with tiered layers of face brick. A gray slate roof and indigenous quartzite for the temple's perimeter walls and entrance archways are designed to fit in with the historic buildings nearby.

Gordon B. Hinckley dedicated the temple on 24 August 1985. Although additional temples have been announced in Durban, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Johannesburg temple currently serves church members from the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Madagascar.

The temple has a total floor area of , four ordinance rooms, and three sealing rooms.

In 2020, the Johannesburg South Africa Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
