Tufahije (singular: tufahija) is a Bosnian dessert made of walnut-stuffed apples poached in sugar water. It is very popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, North Macedonia, and Croatia.

The Bulgarian pechani yabalki are also stuffed with walnuts, but are usually baked, not poached.

Serving
Tufahije is served in large glasses with their own glazed syrup and whipped cream on top. It's usually accompanied by Bosnian coffee.
