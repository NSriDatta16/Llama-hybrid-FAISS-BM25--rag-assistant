Silent Force is a German power metal band with neoclassical and progressive influences, founded by guitarist Alex Beyrodt.

Band history 
The band was formed in 1999 by German guitarist Alex Beyrodt (Sinner, Primal Fear, Voodoo Circle, The Sygnet) and American singer D.C. Cooper (of Royal Hunt fame). In 2000 their debut album The Empire of Future was released; along with Beyrodt and Cooper there were also Torsten Röhre on keyboards, André Hilgers (who will later play with Rage) and Thorsten Fleisch on bass. In 2001 their second studio album, Infatuator was released by Massacre Records with the addition of Jürgen Steinmetz replacing Fleisch on bass. In 2004 the band moved to Noise Records and with them they released their third studio album Worlds Apart. Their fourth album Walk the Earth was released in February 2007 on AFM Records. In 2013, after a seven-year hiatus, the fifth album is a comeback for the band with a new line-up, featuring vocalist Michael Bormann, bassist Mat Sinner and keyboard player Alessandro Del Vecchio joining the band with Beyrodt and Hilgers retaining their positions. The album title is Rising from Ashes.
