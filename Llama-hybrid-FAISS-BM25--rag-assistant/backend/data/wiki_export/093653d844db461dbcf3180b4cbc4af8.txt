Ron Hauge is an American television writer and executive producer.

Early in his career, Hauge was a contributor to National Lampoon.  In 1989 he created a graphic for Spy Magazine captioned "The World Championship," with wars between countries organized in the form of a tournament bracket; more than 20 years later, it was still being lauded, in The Atlantic, in a political scientist's blog, and on Twitter.

He then wrote for Seinfeld, In Living Color, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Rocko's Modern Life, The Mouse and the Monster, and a short lived reincarnation of The Carol Burnett Show. In 1994, an episode of Ren and Stimpy that he co-wrote was nominated for an Emmy Award for  Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour Or Less).

Hauge joined The Simpsons staff in its eighth season. He won an Emmy for writing the season eight episode "Homer's Phobia", which was his first episode. The Fox censor objected to the episode's exploration of the theme of homosexuality and stated that it was "unsuitable for broadcast". The censors were later fired and their replacements did not have any objections to the episode.
