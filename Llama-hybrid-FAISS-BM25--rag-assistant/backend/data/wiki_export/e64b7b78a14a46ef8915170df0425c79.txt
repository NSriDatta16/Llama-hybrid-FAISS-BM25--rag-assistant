The film was unavailable for many decades, until it was restored and released on home video in France on 23 September 2016 and in the United States on 25 April 2017.

Roman Polanski's segment of the film, "La rivière de diamants" ("A River of Diamonds"), has been removed, at his direct request, and that portion is thus still unavailable.
