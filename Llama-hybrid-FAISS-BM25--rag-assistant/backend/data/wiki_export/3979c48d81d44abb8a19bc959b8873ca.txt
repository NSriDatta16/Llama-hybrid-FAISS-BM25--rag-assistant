Stanford is a deserted village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is situated  north of the town of Thetford and  southwest of the city of Norwich.

The village and most of the parish are within a restricted area and access is not allowed without special permission from the Army.

The parish church of All Saints, like the other surviving churches within the training area, is fitted with blast-proof sheeting to protect the structure, and wire fencing surrounds the church and churchyard to protect from military manoeuvres.
