"Destroy Everything You Touch" is a song by British electronic music band Ladytron. It was released on 19 September 2005 as the second single from their third studio album, Witching Hour. It reached a position of number 42 on the UK Singles Chart, the highest position a Ladytron single has reached to date. It was re-released in the UK on 22 October 2007. The song ranked at #137 on Pitchfork's "The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s" list.

Music video
The music video, directed by Adam Bartley, shows the members of Ladytron hiking through a mountain range, facing various hazards such as two-legged creatures attempting to attack them, and having frosty wind blown at them by faces in the mountains (which are the members of Ladytron, with makeup added to them to make their skin look covered with snow and ice).

Remixes
The single has been remixed by Sasha for his mix/remix album Invol2ver. On 19 May 2009, a cover version by The Faint was released on an iTunes single titled "The Faint/Ladytron Tour – Single" (with Ladytron contributing a remix of The Faint's "Mirror Error").
