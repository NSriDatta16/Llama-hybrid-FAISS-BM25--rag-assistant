Culverhouse Cross () is a district straddling the boundary between Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, in the community of Wenvoe.

The district is centred on a major traffic roundabout that links West Cardiff to the M4 motorway and is home to a number of different retail outlets, and formerly ITV Wales's headquarters.

History
According to place-name etymologist Deric Meidrum John, there has been a crossroads at Culverhouse Cross for some centuries, originally at the intersection of the Cardiff to Cowbridge turnpike and the road between the parishes of St Fagans and Wenvoe. He states that a farmhouse by the name Culverhouse existed nearby and that the word Culver refers to a pigeon. The Welsh equivalent name Cwrlwys was apparently recorded in 1776. Research at British History Online shows that the word Culverhouse may also refer to a dovecot.

The Coedarhydyglyn estate, seat of numerous local prominent men from 1767 onwards, is located at the top of Tumble Hill above the crossroads.

Significant commercial and retail development of the area began in 1984 when HTV, the local commercial television contractor at that time, established television headquarters, studios and related facilities near the village of Wenvoe. Renamed ITV Wales, the company downsized and relocated to Cardiff Bay in 2014, and the entire Culverhouse Cross studio, technical and office complex was demolished in April 2015.

Tesco was the first store to be built in Culverhouse Cross in 1986, preceding a decade of rapid development in the suburb because of its accessible location. Demolition of the old Tesco superstore began in March 2007 and operated out of a temporary structure while a new Tesco Extra was built in its place. This opened on 22 October 2007.
