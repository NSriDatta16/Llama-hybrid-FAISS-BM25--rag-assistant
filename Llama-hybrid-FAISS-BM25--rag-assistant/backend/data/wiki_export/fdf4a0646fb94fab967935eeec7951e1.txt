Club career
As with many leading Georgian players, Kavelashvili began his career with FC Dinamo Tbilisi, emerging from their youth system in 1989. A skilful striker, he soon established himself in the Dinamo side before earning a move to Russian club FC Spartak Vladikavkaz in 1995.

He began training with Manchester City F.C. on 1 March 1996  before finally joining the club on transfer deadline day. He made his city debut on 6 April scoring in the derby game against Manchester United F.C. Following City's relegation, he played 24 games (2 goals) in the Football League First Division. The number was not enough to secure a renewal of his work permit and so he was sent out on loan to Grasshopper Club Zürich, winning a Swiss Super League in 1998. He has since played the majority of his football in Switzerland, featuring for Fussballclub Zürich, FC Lucerne, FC Sion and FC Aarau. Aarau loaned him out to Vladikavkaz in Autumn 2004, but he returned to Switzerland after playing just seven games.

Kavelashvili joined FC Basel's first team during their 2005–06 season under head coach Christian Gross, who was in his seventh season with the club in that position. Gross had been head coach for GC as Kavelashvili had won the Swiss championship in the 1997–98 season. Kavelashvili played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game in the St. Jakob-Park on 12 March 2006 as he was substituted in the 66th minute. He also scored his first goal for the team during the same game, it was the match winning goal as Basel won 1–0 against Grasshopper Club. Basel had started the season well and were joint leaders of the championship with Zürich right until the last day of the league campaign. On the final day of the league season FCB played at home against FCZ. A last-minute goal from Zürich's Iulian Filipescu meant the final score was 1-2 in favour of the away team and it gave FCZ their first national championship since 1980–81. The title for Basel was lost on goal difference.

Kavelashvili had 10 appearances for FCB in his first season and in each he had been used as a substitute. In his second season he also made 7 appearances, again each as substitute, but the club released him before the winter break, and he retired from his active football career. During his period with the club, he played a total of 26 games for Basel scoring a total of 12 goals. 14 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, three in the UEFA Cup and nine were friendly games. He scored four goals in the domestic league and the other eight during the test games.
