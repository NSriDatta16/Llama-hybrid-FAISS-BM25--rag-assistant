Career

Plymouth Argyle
Connolly came through the youth ranks at Plymouth Argyle, and made his league debut in the final game of the 2000–01 season. Connolly was a first team regular from 2003 onwards, helping the team to gain promotion to the First Division in 2003–04. He scored his first and only goal for Plymouth against Norwich on 10 November 2007.

Derby County
Connolly's contract expired at the end of the 2007–08 season, and on 15 May 2008 he moved to Derby County on a free transfer. Connolly later revealed that "I was becoming stale, it's a lovely part of the world [Plymouth] but it's time to move on, the enjoyment was going... I left because I felt I was losing that edge, I've been in a comfort zone."

Connolly made his Derby debut as a substitute in an opening day home defeat to Doncaster Rovers. Despite initial being kept out of the starting line-up by Tyrone Mears, the latter's move to Marseille on loan ensure Connolly became the club's first choice right back and, later appointed team captain by manager Paul Jewell. He finished the season with 49 league and cup appearances, only behind Rob Hulse in terms of most appearances for the club during the 2008–09 campaign and scored one goal – a last minute header to equalise in a 1–1 draw with Burnley on 4 April. Connolly made his 200th career league appearance three weeks later in a 2–0 home defeat against Reading.

In August 2009, Robbie Savage was appointed Derby Captain by Nigel Clough, who had replaced Paul Jewell after he had resigned in December 2008. Clough stated that he wanted Connolly to "concentrate on his own game. (He) was quite relieved in some ways because it is a big responsibility, especially when you are at full-back and out of the action.". Although Connolly started the 2009–10 season as first choice right back he eventually fell down the pecking order as Clough deciding to bring in his own players and as a result bought in Premier League rightbacks from Fulham and Bolton Wanderers in the shape of Fredrik Stoor and Nicky Hunt respectively.

Sheffield United loan

To get some games under his belt Connolly joined Sheffield United on a monthlong emergency loan as defensive cover, making his debut the same evening in a 3–0 victory over Blackpool. The loan was initially extended for another week but, with it becoming mathematically impossible for Sheffield United to make the playoffs, he returned to Pride Park after having made seven appearances for The Blades.

Return to Derby
After returning to Derby, Connolly made the bench for the penultimate game of the season against Bristol City, coming on in the second half to make his first appearance in three months.

Connolly was given the number 2 shirt, displacing Jason Crowe who had previously occupied the shirt number. He made his Leeds debut in the first game of the season against his old club Derby County on 7 August 2010 which ended in a 2–1 defeat. Connolly missed his first game for Leeds when a hamstring injury ruled him out of the game against Doncaster Rovers.

On 8 January, Connolly helped earn Leeds a 1–1 draw against Arsenal, Leeds were 1–0 up when Robert Snodgrass scored a second half penalty, Arsenal equalised in the 90th minute when Cesc Fabregas scored a penalty. Connolly was ruled out for several games with injury and lost his place in the Leeds side to Eric Lichaj, however once Connolly recovered from injury he returned to the Leeds side and Lichaj was moved to the left back position.

Connolly started for Leeds the opening day of the season as they lost 3–1 against Southampton. Connolly was substituted against Bradford City and his replacement Tom Lees made an impressive impact, which meant that Connolly was dropped for the following matches.

After a spell out of the squad, Connolly returned to Leeds' starting 11 against Portsmouth on 1 October at right back with Tom Lees moving back into the centre back position, Leeds also kept their first clean sheet of the season in the same game.
