Tijani Belaïd (; born 6 September 1987) is a professional footballer who plays for Cholet in the Championnat National as an attacking midfielder. Born in France, he played for the Tunisia national team at international level.

Club career
Born in Paris, France, Belaïd started his career at Paris FC, close to his birthplace.

Inter Milan
In 2004, he signed for Internazionale's Primavera side. The first Serie A appearance of Belaïd was in the last match of 2004–05 season, against Reggina Calcio.

In January 2007, Belaïd was loaned to PSV Eindhoven, but did not feature for the first team.

Slavia Prague
In the summer of 2007, Belaïd was sent on loan to Slavia Prague. With the Czech team he scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League on 19 September 2007. However, in October he was demoted to train with the club's 'B' team after disciplinary problems. Coach Karel Jarolím stated: "I think he needs to think above all about his behaviour off the pitch, I don't like his attitude when he doesn't play or when he comes on as a substitute". A month later, Belaïd was taken back to the main squad.

In January 2008, while preparing for the 2008 African Cup of Nations with the Tunisian national team, he was involved in a car crash, which resulted in the deaths of three people. He was kept in custody for several days, but was later cleared of any charges by the court. Belaïd finished the 2007–08 season with 15 league appearances for Slavia, in which he scored four goals.

In July 2008, Slavia Prague used an option to buy him from Internazionale for undisclosed fee. Belaïd signed a three-year contract. In February 2010, he was trialed at Mladá Boleslav to finalize a possible loan, however the trial was unsuccessful, and he returned to Slavia Prague.

In 2011, Belaïd was released by Slavia Prague, having made 49 league appearances and scored 11 goals during his permanent spell at the club.

Hull City
On 17 January 2011, he started a trial with English Championship club Hull City and was strongly linked also with their Championship rivals Cardiff City. On 20 January 2010, it was confirmed that, subject to international clearance, Hull City had won the race to signing him, with him penning a deal until the end of the season, with an option of two more years, should the club want him to stay. The deal was confirmed a week later on 27 January, with the news that he would be available for the squad to play Queens Park Rangers on 29 January. Belaïd made his debut on 1 February 2011 coming off the bench as a replacement for Aaron McLean in the 2–2 draw against Leeds United at the KC Stadium.

On 10 May 2011, following the end of the 2010–11 season, it was confirmed by the club that Belaïd had been released from Hull City along with three other players, after making only eight appearances for the East Riding of Yorkshire club.

APOEL
On 31 August 2011, Belaïd signed a two years contract with Cypriot champions and UEFA Champions League contenders APOEL. He made his official debut on 15 October in a League game against AEL Limassol, coming on as a substitute early into the second half. On 19 November 2011, he scored his first goal for APOEL in a Cypriot First Division match against Ermis Aradippou, by scoring APOEL's second goal in a 2–0 home win. He made his debut in the UEFA Champions League group stages with APOEL on 6 December 2011, after coming on as a substitute on 60th minute, in his side's 2–0 home loss from Shakhtar Donetsk for the final matchday of Group G. In January 2012, Belaid's contract was terminated by APOEL, leaving the club after four months.

CS Sfaxien
After losing Moncer, Maâloul and Ajayi this summer, CS Sfaxien begins to fill up. In this context, the club carried out a fine contract by signing Tijani Belaïd. The 28-year-old midfielder was free since leaving Club Africain, where he refused to renew his contract. After having passed his medical successfully, the Tunisian international is committed for a remarkable season. On 2 January 2017, he mutually solved his contract with the club.
