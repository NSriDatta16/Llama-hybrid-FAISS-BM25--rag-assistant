Conrad I (also Konrad) (born 915/920 - died 20 August 997) was Duke of Swabia from 983 until 997. His appointment as duke marked the return of Conradine rule over Swabia for the first time since 948.

Life
There is considerable confusion about Conrad and his family. He is often identified with Cuno of Öhningen. The identities of his parents are not known for certain. His father is sometimes said to be Count Udo from the Wetterau, and his mother an unknown daughter of Herbert I, Count of Vermandois. There is also some debate about the identity of Conrad's wife. She is often said to be Reglint (or Richlind), daughter of Liudolf, Duke of Swabia, and thus a granddaughter of Emperor Otto I. Others argue that his wife was Judith, daughter of Adalbert of Marchtal.

When Duke Otto I unexpectedly died during the Imperial campaign in Italy of 981-982, he left no heirs. To fill the vacancy, Emperor Otto II (who may have been Conrad's brother-in-law) appointed Conrad as Duke of Swabia. Conrad is notable for being the first Swabian duke to keep the title in the family; after his death in 997 he was succeeded by his son Hermann II.

Children
With his wife, Conrad had at least six children, including:
 Liutold
 Conrad
 Hermann II
 Ita, who married  Rudolf II, Count of Altdorf
 an unnamed daughter, who married Vladimir the Great
 Judith, who married firstly an unnamed husband from Rheinfelden, and secondly, Adalbert II, Count of Metz (died 1033)
 Kunizza "Hemma" (died 1020), who married Friedrich I., probably count of Dießen
