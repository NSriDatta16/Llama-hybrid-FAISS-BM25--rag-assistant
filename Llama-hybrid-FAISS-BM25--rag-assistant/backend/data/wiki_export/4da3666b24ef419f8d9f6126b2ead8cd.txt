Background
"Love That Man" was written by Babyface, Rob Fusari, Calvin Gaines, Eritza Laues, Bill Lee, and Balewa Muhammad, while production was helmed by Babyface and Fusari. Commenting on his involvement with Just Whitney, Fusari said: "Arista liked my song "Love That Man," and they wanted me to produce it on Whitney’s new album [...] They flew me down to Miami to work with Whitney on this song. I ended up co-producing this song with Babyface."

Critical reception
BBC Music reviewer Keysha Davids found that "Love That Man" sounds "suspiciously like an ode to her much criticised hubby. Here Whitney comes across as soulful and sincere as she ooohs and aaahs in the right places. The mid-tempo track harks back to 80s soul with its simple bass line, and unfussy production." Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe panned the single with "stands by her bad boy."
