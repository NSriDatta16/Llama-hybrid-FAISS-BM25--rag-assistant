Elections for the Massachusetts Governor's Council were held on November 7, 2006. Candidates from the Democratic Party were elected or re-elected to all eight districts.

The Governor's Council (also known as the Executive Council) of Massachusetts is a popularly elected board which must, among its duties, approve or disapprove of the governor's judicial nominations, pardons, and commutations.  The councillors are elected every two years from eight councillor districts across the Commonwealth.  The lieutenant governor of Massachusetts serves as an ex officio member. The 2006 Massachusetts Gubernatorial election was held on the same date as the Council election, as well as other State and Federal elections.
