The president of the Gaelic Athletic Association () is the head of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).

The president holds office for three years. The role of president has existed since the foundation of the GAA.

They also have become known for other roles such as Seán Kelly, who is now an MEP.

The president travels across Ireland and the world to promote the organisation and attend games; former President Nickey Brennan travelled 160,000 miles in Ireland alone during his three years as president, and visited Great Britain, Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East on several occasions, meeting dignitaries such as New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg along the way.
