Jnana Prabodhini, which means 'Awakener of Knowledge' in Sanskrit, is a social organization in India. Founded in 1962 with the motto "motivating intelligence for social change", its activities have expanded into multiple aspects of social work. The main activity of the organization is to provide education. It aims at refining the physical, mental, intellectual, and spiritual qualities of people in general and of the youth in particular, believing that this development will encourage positive social leadership qualities. Its activities are centered in the fields of education, research, rural development, health, and youth organisation.

The organization is headquartered in Pune, Maharashtra, formed around a cluster of public charitable trusts. It is active in most districts of Maharashtra, with facilities in Pune, Nigdi, Salumbre, Solapur, Harali, and Ambajogai. It does some work in parts of Jammu and Kashmir and the northeastern states of India. The organization has started a school in Nigdi, Solapur and Sadashiv Peth, Pune.

Foundation and activities 

Jnana Prabodhini was founded by psychologist, educator and social organizer Shri V. V. Pendse, who was inspired by Swami Vivekananda to create an organization that would change the nation through "man-making education". This is an extension of the Hindu concept of "Dharm-Sansthapana" – a belief in cycles of societal resurgence and reconstruction propelled by ancient heroes and saints. This belief was advocated by Samarth Ramdas in the 17th century, and by Maharshi Dayanand, Swami Vivekananda, and Yogi Arvinda. Having studied leadership styles, Pendse believed that a congenial atmosphere for education would inspire even-mindedness, and that intelligence was present among all social castes. The organization sought to identify intelligence at an impressionable age, and initially conducted enrichment programs at the high school level.

According to the organization's website, its vision is to transform society through education with a core of spirituality, enabling leaders to emerge who will be motivated to serve society with compassion. It also seeks to create an organization of selfless workers across all walks of life. Its primary area of activity is leadership development, which has been carried out in the sectors of education, research, health, rural development, women's empowerment (Hindi: Stree Shakti Prabodhan), national integration, and youth organization.
