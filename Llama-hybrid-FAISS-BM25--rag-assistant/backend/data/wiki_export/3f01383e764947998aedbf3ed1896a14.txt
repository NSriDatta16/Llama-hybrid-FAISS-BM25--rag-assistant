The Regal Theatre is a fine Art Deco theatre located in the suburb of Subiaco in Perth, Western Australia. It was built in 1937, and the official opening was on 27 April 1938. It was built by a wealthy grazier family Coade/Hewett, who were the grandparents and parents of the playwright Dorothy Hewett.

The theatre was named for King George VI who, at the time it was being constructed, had taken up the throne. It was originally a theatre for films, but in 1977 the Regal was converted into a live theatre. It is one of the few remaining theatres in Perth.
