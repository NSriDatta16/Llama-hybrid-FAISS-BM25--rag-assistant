Overview 
Milio's was started in 1989 as a sandwich shop on West Johnson Street. Demand for Milio's grew, and expansion began around Madison. In 2004, the company began franchising and changed its name from Big Mike's Super Subs to Milio's Sandwiches. Each store bakes fresh bread every four hours, every day.

In October 2020, close friends Brian Bergen, Timm Heller, Todd Mancusi, Tony Mancusi, and Chris Gentilli became owners of Milio's Sandwiches. The company has been recognized for its community involvement program that was founded in 2021 and gives back to local nonprofits. 

Milio's Sandwiches were awarded the silver and bronze medals in Madison Magazine's Best of Madison and Awards for Best Sandwich Spot, respectively.

Products 
Milio's Sandwiches has several signature sandwiches available on different bread and wrap options. The menu also features seasonal soup offerings, cookies, chips, rotating specialty sandwiches, and more.

Milio's Sandwiches created a new mobile ordering app in 2022.
