"You Remind Me" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige. It served as Blige's first single from her debut album, What's the 411? (1992). Written by Eric Milteer and produced by Dave "Jam" Hall, it was originally used on the soundtrack of 1991 comedy film Strictly Business. The song marked Blige's first top forty hit, reaching number twenty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B Singles chart. The music video was released in 1992. The song also sampled Patrice Rushen’s 1982 song, ‘Remind Me’.

Critical reception
J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun complimented the "smooth, soulful balladry" of "You Remind Me". Havelock Nelson from Entertainment Weekly noted its "cascading, intricately layered mid-tempo beat". James Hamilton from Music Weeks RM Dance Update described it as a "slinky groin grinder". Dele Fadele from NME remarked its "massed harmonies, lovely arrangements and subtle hip-hop beats" and "a luxurious, creamy vocal that makes you wonder why record companies don't seek out more black female singers (remember Cherrelle, Candi Staton, et al)." Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel wrote, "Blige's voice swoops and croons wonderfully on her big hit, "You Remind Me". The tune is built around a nice little phrase but wouldn't really go anywhere if it weren't for the funky hip-hop beat."
