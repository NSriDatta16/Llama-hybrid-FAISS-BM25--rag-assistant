Service history

1957–1959
The new tank landing ship was fitted out and underwent ready-for-sea trials at Port Everglades, Florida and conducted shakedown training out of her home port, Little Creek, Virginia, which she completed on 17 May 1958. She conducted various operations in the Virginia area until 15 July, when all training was cancelled due to the Lebanon Crisis and York County prepared for extended operations. But the Lebanon Crisis lessened, and the ship proceeded to Vieques, Puerto Rico, for amphibious exercises. On 7 August York County returned to her home port and began preparations for a regularly scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean. She arrived at Gibraltar in late September 1958; then visited Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, and Italy. She returned to Little Creek on 25 March 1959. However, the ship recrossed the Atlantic to hold leading roles in two major amphibious exercises "Tralex 3–59" and "Tralex 4–59" which were conducted off the coast of Spain. In November 1959, York County entered the Norfolk Shipbuilding and Drydock Company for maintenance and upkeep.

She next departed the east coast of the United States on 11 January 1960 for her second Mediterranean deployment. Following her arrival back at her home port on 15 June, York County participated in "Tralex 1–60" and "Lantphibex 500/61" in the area of Vieques, Puerto Rico. In July, she proceeded to Baltimore for an overhaul by the Maryland Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. Upon emerging from the yard, the ship conducted refresher training before deploying to the Caribbean towards the end of November for training operations with other amphibious ships. She returned to Little Creek on 19 January 1961. The next major exercise, "SoLant Amity III," started on 17 April and took York County 27,000 miles in an effort to establish greater understanding between the peoples of the United States and southern Africa. The ship cruised along both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts of Africa and visited 12 ports in 10 countries and received some 23,000 visitors.

After a short midshipman cruise in early November 1961, York County headed for the Caribbean where she participated in Exercise "Phiblex 4–61" before returning to Little Creek in January 1962 for leave and upkeep. On 26 February, she conducted a two-week reserve cruise off the coast of Florida.
