Lieutenant General Jonathon Peter Riley,  (born 16 January 1955) is a retired British Army officer and military historian.

Military career
Riley joined the British Army as an officer cadet in 1971, and was commissioned into the Queen's Regiment in 1974. He was promoted to lieutenant on 9 March 1976, to captain on 9 September 1980 and, having attended the Staff College, Camberley, in 1987, he was promoted to major at the end of the year. During this time he saw active service in Northern Ireland.

Promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1993, Riley undertook a tour as an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, that year. He was deployed as Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion the Royal Welch Fusiliers to the Muslim enclave of Goražde in 1995 under a mandate to ensure the Serbs did not violate the NATO ultimatum. The Army of Republika Srpska attacked the town without warning, capturing 33 soldiers under Riley's command and several hundred other fellow United Nations peacekeepers in May. Having halted the initial Serb attack, the battalion handed over the defence of the enclave to the Bosnian 81st Division. During the siege that followed, protocol was broken when first the Director of Military Operations, then the Chief of the General Staff and finally Prime Minister John Major telephoned Riley to be briefed on the situation. The enclave was successfully defended and unlike Srebrenica and Zepa it never fell to the Serbs; the 33 Fusiliers and fellow UN peacekeepers were later rescued safely. Riley was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for gallantry and distinguished services in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia in 1996, and promoted to full colonel in July 1997.

Promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1998, Riley became commander of the 1st Mechanised Brigade in Bosnia in 1999 and commander of the UK Joint Task Force in Sierra Leone in 2000. He was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service for his service in Sierra Leone. He became Deputy Commandant of the Staff College and Director of the Higher Command and Staff Course in 2001.

Riley was deployed as Deputy Commanding General of the Coalition Military Advisory and Training Team in Iraq in May 2003 and then became Commanding General Multi-National Division (South East), Iraq and GOC British Forces in November 2004 with promotion to major general. In 2005, he was awarded the United States' Legion of Merit for his service in Iraq.

Riley served as Colonel of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, from 2006 to 2007. On 18 December 2007, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and appointed deputy commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. He was awarded the NATO Meritorious Service Medal by the Secretary-General of NATO and, having been appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 2008 New Year Honours, he transferred to the reserve on 15 September 2009.

On 14 December 2009, Riley gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry, in which he stated that British troops had not expected to be faced with an insurgency and also defended the decision to disband the Iraqi Army after the invasion. Then, in February 2011, he gave evidence at the trial of Radovan Karadžić at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague on the incident in May 1995 when his troops had been held in captivity.

Later life
Riley was appointed Director General and Master of the Royal Armouries, Britain's national collection of arms and armour, early in September 2009. Subsequently, he was appointed Visiting Professor in War Studies at King's College London.

In 2012, Jonathon Riley resigned as director general of the Royal Armouries. His departure came six months after his suspension on full pay pending a review of issues raised by the museum’s auditors. The nature of the auditing issue remains confidential. It was later revealed that he was suspended after senior staff were given irregularly large pay increases at a time when the museum’s budget was being reduced.

Riley joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in 2012. He said he "believed passionately that we had to regain our national sovereignty, the control of our laws and our borders, and escape the unelected, unaccountable tyranny of the EU Commission." He later left the party, arguing it had "lost its way" and stating that he disagreed with the views of those who had taken charge at the time.

Riley is on the advisory board of Veterans for Britain, an organisation with the aim "to put forward the Defence and Security arguments for the UK to vote to leave the European Union" and following the referendum to "Support Her Majesty's Government in the task of restoring full sovereign control to all aspects of the defence of the Realm in accordance with that mandate of the people."

On 19 January 2021, Riley re-joined UKIP, and was selected as the lead candidate for UKIP for the Mid and West Wales region of the Senedd for the 2021 election. He was not elected to the Senedd, with UKIP getting 1.57% of this region's vote, having lost 86% of its 2016 support. As at 14 February 2022, he still appeared as a Spokesperson for UKIP and as at 9 August 2022 in the same capacity on the official UKIP Veterans webpage.
