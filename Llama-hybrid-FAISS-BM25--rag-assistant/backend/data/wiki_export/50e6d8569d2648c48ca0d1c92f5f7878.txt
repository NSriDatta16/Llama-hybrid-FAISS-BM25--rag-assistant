History
Galway County Council dates from 1899, created by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, which introduced county councils to Ireland. It took over the local administration until then carried out by county grand juries and county at large presentment sessions, which included the maintenance of highways and bridges, the upkeep of lunatic asylums, and the appointment of coroners. The new council also took over some duties from the poor law boards of guardians in relation to diseases of cattle and from the justices of the peace to regulate explosives.

The County Council initially met in Tuam. It subsequently acquired the old Galway Infirmary and converted it into a new county headquarters. A modern facility, known as County Hall, was built on the same site and completed in 1999.
