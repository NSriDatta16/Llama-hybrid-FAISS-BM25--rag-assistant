Death Before Musick is the fourth and most recent studio album by American rock band Amen. It was released in the United Kingdom on April 5, 2004, and in the United States on May 18, 2004, through eatURmusic and Columbia Records. The album continues the hardcore and punk genres of previous albums and draws on heavy metal as influence. 

The album spawned the hit single and promotional video for "California's Bleeding."  Drummer Luke Johnson, who joined the band around the time of the album's release and tour, appeared with the band in the photo shoot in the album's booklet but did not play on the album. This ended up being their last release in over 18 years as the band went on hiatus and had several personnel changes.

On April 19, 2010, Death Before Musick was reissued in the United Kingdom by IronBird Records. The reissue features four bonus tracks and a new interview with Casey Chaos.
