Silence Screams is the eighth studio album, by American Christian rock band Resurrection Band (known at this point as REZ), released in 1988.

Recording history
After the longest break between studio albums, REZ returned with a blues-based hard rock/metal sound (closer to their 1978 release Awaiting Your Reply) that would set the pattern for all future releases, and was also indicative of the musical direction lead singer Glenn Kaiser would take in his solo career. The album is highlighted by a cover of Blind Faith's "Presence of the Lord," which was the first in a string of cover tunes that REZ would include on almost every successive release.

As indicated by the unsettling album cover art, the lyrics deal with some very dark themes by focusing on the plight of the disenfranchised, whether they be victims of war ("Someone Sleeps"), greed ("Waitin' on Sundown") or racial profiling ("Three Seconds").  "Light/Light" is another of the album's highlights, and proved a popular live track throughout the 1990s.

This is the first album the band released on their own record label, Grrr Records, and the first with new bassist Roy Montroy, since Jim Denton left the band in 1987 to enter theological seminary.
