The key political players in Haryana state in northern India are the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the Indian National Congress, the Indian National Lok Dal, and smaller parties like the Haryana Janhit Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party partaking in various state (Haryana Legislative Assembly) and national level (Lok sabha) elections in Haryana.

The dynastic political clans of Haryana are often criticised for the infamous self-serving politics of the Aaya Ram Gaya Ram turncoats who notoriously engage in frequent party switching, political horse trading, unholy political alliances, political corruption, political cronyism, nepotistic-dynastic rule, which serves their clan more than it serves their voters and people of Haryana they are ought to serve.
