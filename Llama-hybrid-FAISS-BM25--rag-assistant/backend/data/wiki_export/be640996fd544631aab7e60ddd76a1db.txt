History

The first Deacon Convenor of the joint seven trades was George Elphinstone, a saddler in the Guild of Hammermen, appointed in June 1587. In an effort to alleviate disputes between the various trades this body was created and created what was known as the Aberdeen Magna Carta, a charter drawn up to agree processes and settlement of disputes ratified in August 1587 and raised to the status of a Royal Charter by King James VI on 16 July 1617.
