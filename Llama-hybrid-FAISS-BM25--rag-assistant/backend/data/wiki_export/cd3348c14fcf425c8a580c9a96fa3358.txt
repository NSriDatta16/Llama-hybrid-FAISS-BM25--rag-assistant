History
The company started as Rollins Broadcasting in 1948, founded by  John W. Rollins and his brother, O. Wayne Rollins.  The company, originally financed in large part by John Rollins' auto dealerships, began as Rollins Broadcasting when the brothers purchased a 1460 WRAD, an AM radio station based in the rural town of Radford, Virginia.  The company grew to include other radio stations, such as jazz station WBEE (AM 1570) in Harvey, Illinois, television stations such as WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, Orkin, Inc., Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, a trucking concern (later sold to Penske Truck Leasing), a hazardous waste disposal service, an oil services business, and a cable television company.  In 1984 the company spun off its oil services business, RPC, Inc. () to shareholders.

Gary Rollins, son of O. Wayne Rollins, has been the CEO since July 24, 2001.
