The North Star School District in Boswell, Somerset County, Pennsylvania in the United States was formed in 1969 with the merger of predecessors Jenner-Boswell and Forbes school districts. The district includes the boroughs of Boswell, Stoystown, Jennerstown, and Hooversville and the townships Jenner and Quemahoning in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. The name North Star is taken from U.S. Route 219, the North Star Way, which runs through the district.  That name for the highway has since fallen out of favor.  The district encompasses approximately 102 square miles. According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 9,519.
