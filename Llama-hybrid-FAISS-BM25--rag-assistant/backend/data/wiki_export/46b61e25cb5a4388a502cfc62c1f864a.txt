Shoulder Sleeve Insignia

Description
On a shield arched at top  in height and  in width overall a crusader's unsheathed sword, point to top and with white blade and yellow hilt, superimposed on a blue stylized arrow throughout, shaft tapered and points and angled tips of arrowhead touching top and sides of shield, the areas on each side of the tapered shaft yellow and the areas on each side of the arrowhead red all within a  white border.

Symbolism 
The shape of the shield and the unsheathed crusader's sword (the "Sword of Freedom") were suggested by the shoulder sleeve insignia previously authorized for the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, and the United States Army, Vietnam. The stylized blue arrow and sword are used to represent the purpose and military might of the II Field Force pressing against, sweeping back, and breaking through enemy forces symbolized by the red areas. The dividing of the red and yellow areas of the shield into two parts allude to the numerical designation of the II Field Force, the colors red and yellow also being those of Vietnam. The colors red, white and blue are the national colors of the United States and further allude to the three major combat arms: Infantry, Artillery and Armor.

Background 
The shoulder sleeve insignia was approved on 5 October 1966.   (TIOH Dwg. No. A-1-437)

Distinctive unit insignia

Description/Blazon
A gold color metal and enamel insignia  in height overall consisting of a gold and scarlet device in the shape and background design of the authorized shoulder sleeve insignia of the II Field Force, Vietnam, between two conjoining green fronds of palm all surmounted by a vertical stylized blue arrow with a shallow pointed tapered shaft, the tip of the arrow and the shaft extending beyond the background design and over the palm frond, the side tips of the arrow touching the sides and the two areas above the side tips of scarlet, bearing an unsheathed Crusader sword with point up, the hilt gold and the blade white.

Symbolism 
The operations and numerical designation are indicated by the scarlet and gold (yellow) device in the shape and background design of the authorized shoulder sleeve insignia of the II Field Force, Vietnam, and by the unsheathed Crusader sword which has become associated with Vietnam and the blue stylized arrow both of which were also suggested by the shoulder sleeve insignia and when taken together allude to the numeral II (or Second). The scarlet and gold (yellow) background and green palm fronds refer to the major combat operational area of the II Field Force which includes the defense of Saigon. The palm fronds are also symbolic of successful achievement.

Background 
The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 27 November 1968.

Combat Service Identification Badge

A gold color metal and enamel device  in height consisting of a design similar to the shoulder sleeve insignia.
