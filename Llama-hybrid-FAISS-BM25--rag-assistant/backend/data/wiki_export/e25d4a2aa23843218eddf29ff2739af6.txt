History
The Tapatío Hot Sauce company was started in 1971 by Jose-Luis Saavedra Sr., in a  warehouse in Maywood, California.  In 1985, the company moved to a  facility in Vernon, California,  from Downtown Los Angeles. Although larger than the first location, the new factory had a single loading dock and limited storage space, which created a new series of problems for the company. After a long search, a site was found for a developer to custom-build a new  facility, which Tapatío presently occupies.  The new factory has several loading docks and automated production.

Other products
In 2011, Frito-Lay released a line of Tapatío-flavored Doritos, Ruffles, and Fritos in the United States.

Tapatío Ramen was introduced in 2018.

In 2021, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the brand, they collaborated with Gabriel Iglesias for a special edition of the hot sauce, Tapatio X Fluffy.
