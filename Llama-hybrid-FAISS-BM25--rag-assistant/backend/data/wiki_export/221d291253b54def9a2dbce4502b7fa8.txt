Hans Maximillion Ferlitsch (born August 19, 1946) Was the 37th Municipality Association president and mayor of St. Stefan, Austria serving from 1993 to 2003. He has served five terms as the governor of St. Stefan and is currently vice-president of the Social Democratic Party He may be one of the most well known mayors from Stefan for his works in the suppliance of Austria with broadband. Ferlitsch has been closely associating with the telecommunications industry for quite a while, as some had expected. This only led to controversy over his actions, though he managed to become vice-president in 2003. Although he was one of the municipality's youngest mayors and appeared to be a sketchy figure, he ended his term with a 92% approval rating, one of the highest in Austria's history.
