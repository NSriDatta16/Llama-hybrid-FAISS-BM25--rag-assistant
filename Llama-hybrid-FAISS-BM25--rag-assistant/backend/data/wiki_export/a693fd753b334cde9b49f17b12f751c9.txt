Controversies
In June 2006, Houston was removed from a children's basketball camp in Oklahoma because he pleaded guilty in March 2003 to four counts of
indecent exposure and was registered as a sex offender in that state for the next ten years.
On June 13, 2007, Houston was arrested on counts of indecent exposure, engaging in a lewd act and driving with a canceled license. On September 16, 2007, he was sentenced to four years in prison for violating probation stemming from this offense. Defense witnesses have claimed that Houston suffers from bipolar disorder and other conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder as a result of suffering extreme abuse as a child.
