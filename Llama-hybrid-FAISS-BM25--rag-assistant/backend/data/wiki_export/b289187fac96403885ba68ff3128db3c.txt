Academics
The school offers courses leading to either an associate’s degree or the Guaranteed Transfer Program, under which students are guaranteed admission to a four-year University of Wisconsin System college of their choice if they meet the academic requirements. UW-Wausau also has a collaborative program with UW-Stevens Point and UW–Oshkosh that allows students to be dually enrolled in both colleges, and to take select courses from those colleges on the UW-Marathon County campus, to earn bachelor’s degrees in Business Administration, General Studies, Web and Digital Media Development, and Nursing. UWSP-Wausau also has an agreement with neighboring Northcentral Technical College (NTC) whereby a student can earn a one-year, 30- to 32-credit general studies certificate at NTC and then transfer to UWMC to complete the Associate of Arts and Sciences degree.
