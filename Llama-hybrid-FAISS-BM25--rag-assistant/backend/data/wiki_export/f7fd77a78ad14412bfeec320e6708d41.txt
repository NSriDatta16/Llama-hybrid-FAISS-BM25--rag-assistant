The Last Days Of Jesus is a Slovak rock band. They formed in Bratislava in May 1992 to combine the spirit of old school deathrock with new musical sounds and patterns. The name originates from a headline band member MaryO read in an American newspaper.

History
MaryO formed the band with Vajco on drums and Sulo, an organist. They then collected Feššy and Andrea, an early bass player. During 1994 this line-up recorded their first demotape and played several shows around Slovakia culminating in a support slot for Das Ich and Faith and the Muse. They continued to tour throughout 1995 including Germany with Marquee Moon and Forthcoming Fire and completed another demo tape, gaining considerable interest within the European goth scene. A few lineup changes have occurred since then and apart from bringing in a session bass player for their studio albums their current lineup continues to record and play live.

The band has made many (mainly gothic) festival appearances almost every year since their formation including Wave-Gotik-Treffen five times. In 2003 and 2004 they did two mini-tours of the UK which included Beyond the Veil and Dead and Buried. Also in 2004 they were featured in a Slovak music TV show which resulted in their only live album to date. On the side MaryO organises regular events under BatCave.SK
