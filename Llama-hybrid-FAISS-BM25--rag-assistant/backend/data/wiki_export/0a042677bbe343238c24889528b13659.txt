Choo Choo Soul is a children's entertainment act composed of Genevieve Goings and her partner Constantine "DC" Abramson, a dancer and beatboxer dressed as a railroad conductor and engineer, respectively.

History and recordings
Choo Choo Soul began as a collaboration between video game developer Greg Johnson, recording engineer and sound designer Burke Trieschmann, and vocalist Genevieve Goings during dialogue recordings for ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, the first Xbox installment of the ToeJam & Earl video game franchise. Johnson created the concept and recorded melodies and accompaniment tracks onto his cellphone and e-mailed them to Treischmann to develop. Once in the studio, Goings provided vocals.

The act debuted in 2004 as a 16-track CD Baby studio album that described itself as "kids' music that won't drive parents crazy." It is now out of print.

On October 31, 2006, Walt Disney Records released Choo Choo Soul, a 12-track album available through the iTunes Store and other online music outlets. It features most of the same songs as the 2004 release.

In 2007, "Choo Choo Soul with Genevieve!" was honored with a Parents' Choice Award for children's television.

In May 2008, Disney released featured a two-disc set which consisted of the Choo Choo Soul album on CD, and a DVD featuring ten music videos.
