Geoffrey Howard Bourne (17 November 1909 – 19 July 1988) was an Australian-American anatomist and primatologist. In particular, he studied the adrenal gland, conducting pioneering work in histochemistry.

Bourne was director of Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University from 1962 until 1978. Prior to coming to Emory he had taught histology at the University of London and physiology at Oxford University. He received his doctorates from Oxford University (D.Sc., 1935; Ph.D., 1943) and was a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine.
