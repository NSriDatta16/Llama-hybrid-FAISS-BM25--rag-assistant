Shawn Antoski (born March 25, 1970) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played eight seasons in the National Hockey League in the 1990s.

Shawn Antoski has two sons.

Playing career
Antoski played minor hockey for the Don Mills Flyers Midgets of the MTHL in 1986-87 and was drafted in the fourth round (59th overall) of the 1987 OHL priority selection.

Antoski played his junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League with the North Bay Centennials, and was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the first round (18th overall) of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, just ahead of future superstars Keith Tkachuk and Martin Brodeur.

Although his role was primarily that of an enforcer, Antoski was noted for his skating ability, which was exceptional for a player of his size. While his offensive ability was very limited, his speed and size made him a fearsome forechecker and a heavy bodychecker. He was also an able fighter.

Antoski turned professional in 1990 and was assigned to the Milwaukee Admirals, Vancouver's IHL farm team. He spent most of the next three season toiling in minor pro, although he received a brief callup each year, playing in a total of eight NHL games. He finally established himself as an NHL regular in the 1993–94, appearing in 55 games for the Canucks and recording three points and 190 penalty minutes. The highlight of his career came in that year's playoffs, as Vancouver reached the Stanley Cup finals. Playing on a gritty fourth line with Tim Hunter and John McIntyre, Antoski was a physical catalyst for the team and played probably the best hockey of his career.

Early in the 1994–95 season, Antoski was dealt to the Philadelphia Flyers for Josef Beranek, and again participated in a lengthy playoff run as Philadelphia reached the conference finals. In 1995–96, he set career highs by appearing in 64 games and recording 204 PIM, and scored his first career playoff goal.

Antoski signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the 1996–97 season, but only appeared in 13 games for the Penguins before being dealt to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, and only appeared in two games for the Mighty Ducks before his season was ended due to injury. He returned to the Ducks the following season, but on November 24, 1997, he was involved in a serious car accident which left him with a compressed skull fracture. While he recovered fully, it marked the end of his hockey career.

Antoski appeared in 183 NHL games, recording three goals and eight points, along with 599 PIM. He also suited up for 36 playoff games, recording four points and 74 PIM.

His younger brother Shayne, at 6' 4 200 lbs, was a teammate in North Bay, and also went on to a brief pro career, playing two seasons in the ECHL.

Shawn resides in the rural community of Madoc, Ontario, and is the president of the Belleville Minor Hockey Association.

Martinson and Antoski went to the penalty box, then started yelling at each other until Martinson launched his water bottle at Antoski.
