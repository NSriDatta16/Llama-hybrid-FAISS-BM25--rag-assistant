Hawthorn School for Girls is a private, independent, all-girls school located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and offers a Catholic education. It was established in 1989. Hawthorn is a part of the Conference of Independent Schools of Ontario Athletic Association (CIS), and a member of Canadian Accredited Independent Schools (CAIS).

Hawthorn admits from preschool to grade 12. Students take part in various out of school activities, such as the Ontario Classics Conference and The Canadian Independent Schools Music Festival. Students are encouraged to participate in service projects, school plays, musicals, orientations, and sleep-away camps, as these are all opportunities available to students as part of their basic curriculum.  An additional highlight to Upper School students are trips to such places as Peru and Rome.  The Rome trip, which occurs every three years, allows students to visit Italy for a cultural spring break immersion, to be part of many of the things they have studied and learned about only at an academic level.  The Peru trip began in 2010 over March Break; senior Upper School students travelled to Santa Cruz, in the Canete Valley of Peru to volunteer at Condoray, a cultural centre.  They worked with mothers and their children, planting gardens, teaching hygiene to the children through play, and helping in the village in small ways.  The Peru trip was such a success that it will now occur every 3 years.

Educating the whole person is part of Hawthornâ€™s philosophy of education.

A tie is added on Number 1 Dress Days. Students grade 8 and up wear a similar uniform to grade 6 and 7, but a school blazer (navy blue) is also worn, and an optional French-cut blouse.
