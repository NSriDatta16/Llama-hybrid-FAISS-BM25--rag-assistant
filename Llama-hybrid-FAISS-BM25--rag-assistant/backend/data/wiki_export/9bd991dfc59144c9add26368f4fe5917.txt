Lakewood / Fort McPherson is a rail station in Atlanta and East Point, Georgia, serving the Red and Gold lines of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail system. It has an island platform between two tracks. It opened on December 15, 1984. The set up for this station is like many on the East-West line. In a similar layout to that of Oakland City, the road adjacent to the station must be traversed for station access; in the case of Lakewood/Fort MacPherson, a bridge over the roadway is utilized rather than an underpass.

As the name suggests, it provides access to the historic and now-defunct Fort McPherson, and Lakewood. Bus service is provided to the Barge Road Park & Ride, Greenbriar Mall, Southside Industrial Park, and Cellairis Amphitheatre.
