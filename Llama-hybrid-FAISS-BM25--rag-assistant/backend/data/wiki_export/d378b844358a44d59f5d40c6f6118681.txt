Non-alcoholic drinks

Traditional
All Korean traditional non-alcoholic drinks are referred to as "eumcheongnyu" (음청류 ). According to historical documents regarding Korean cuisine, almost 200 items of eumcheongnyu are found. Eumcheongnyu can be divided into the categories of cha (차 tea), tang (탕 boiled water), jang (장 fermented grain juice with sour taste), suksu (숙수), galsu (갈수 thirst water), hwachae (화채 fruit punch), sikhye (식혜 sweet rice drink), sujeonggwa (수정과 persimmon drink), milsu or kkulmul (밀수, 꿀물 honeyed water), jeup (즙 juice) and milk by their ingredient materials and preparation methods. Among the eumcheongnyu, cha, hwachae, sikhye, and sujeonggwa are still widely favored and consumed; however, tang, jang, suksu, and galsu have almost disappeared in the present.
