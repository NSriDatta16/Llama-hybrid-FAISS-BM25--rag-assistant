"Rise" is a song by English singer Gabrielle. It was written by Gabrielle, Ollie Dagois and Ferdy Unger-Hamilton and produced by Jonny Dollar for her same-titled third studio album (1999). Notable for a rare authorised use of a Bob Dylan sample, it takes extensively from his 1973 song "Knockin' on Heaven's Door". Dylan liked "Rise" so much he allowed Gabrielle to use the sample free, while receiving a co-writer credit for providing the song's chord progression and vocal sample.

Released as the second single from the album, the song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in January 2000, becoming her second chart-topper. "Rise" also reached number one in Ireland and charted highly in Austria, Iceland, Norway and New Zealand, where it reached number two in April and May 2000 and ended the year as the country's third-best-selling single.
