The Pendine Museum of Speed was dedicated to the use of Pendine Sands for land speed record attempts. It was opened in 1996 in the village of Pendine, on the south coast of Wales, and was owned and run by Carmarthenshire County Council. The museum received 33,522 visitors in 2009.

For part of each summer the museum housed Babs, the land speed record car in which  was killed in 1927. Babs was excavated in 1969 after 42 years of burial on the beach at Pendine Sands, and restored over the following 16 years by Owen Wyn Owen.

In 2018 it was decided to replace the 1990s museum building, at a cost of Â£7 million. In February 2021, the museum was closed and demolished. The new museum building was completed in early 2023 and opened on March 31st. 

Babs was displayed at the Beaulieu Motor Museum until February 2019 and was returned to Pendine for the reopening back of the Museum of Speed.
