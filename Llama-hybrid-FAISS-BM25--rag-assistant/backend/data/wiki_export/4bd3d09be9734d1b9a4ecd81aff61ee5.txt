The Commuter Train (previously called Tongil-ho) is a class of short-run commuter trains operated by Korail, the national railroad of South Korea. They typically operate once or twice daily in each direction, along a few tens of kilometers of track. They thus provide an important function for many smaller rural communities (and also some New Towns around Seoul), which often lack good transit connections. The Commuter Train suspended its operation on April 1, 2019, due to the construction for the Soyosan-Yeoncheon extension of Seoul Subway Line 1. The services were untouched for nine months, until it started its operation again on January 1, 2020, this time between GwangjuSongjeong and Gwangju, with one stop at Geungnakgang on the Gwangju Line in Gwangju.
