The area of the district is basically flat. Much of the area belongs to the drainage basin of the Luga River. The Luga itself forms the southern border of the district.

History
Originally, the area of the district was populated by Finnic peoples, eventually, the Slavs began arriving. After the 9th century, the area was dependent on the Novgorod Republic. From the 15th century, it was annexed together with all Novgorod Lands by the Grand Duchy of Moscow; it belonged to the Vodskaya pyatina, one of the five pyatinas of Novgorod Lands. The area was constantly at the frontier and became the battleground between Germans and Swedes, on one side, and Russians, on the other side. In 1617, according to the Treaty of Stolbovo, the west of the area was transferred to Sweden, and in 1703, during the Great Northern War, it was conquered back by Russia.

In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate). It was later split between Yamburgsky and Petergofsky Uyezds. The governorate was renamed Petrograd in 1914 and Leningrad in 1924. In May 1922, Yamburgsky Uyezd was renamed Kingiseppsky. On February 14, 1923 Petergofsky Uyezd was merged with Detskoselsky Uyezd to form Gatchinsky Uyezd, with the administrative center located in Gatchina. On February 14, 1923 Gatchina was renamed Trotsk, and Gatchinsky Uyezd was renamed Trotsky Uyezd, after Leon Trotsky.

On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Volosovsky District, with the administrative center in the settlement of Volosovo, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included parts of former Trotsky and Kingiseppsky Uyezds. On April 20, 1930 Kikerino was granted urban-type settlement status, and Volosovo became a suburban settlement. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On July 5, 1937 Volosovo was made an urban-type settlement. Between August 1941 and January 1944, during World War II, the district was occupied by German troops. On February 1, 1963 Volosovsky District was abolished and merged into Kingiseppsky District; on January 13, 1965 it was reestablished. It remained the last district of Leningrad Oblast with the administrative center not having the town status until April 14, 1999, when Volosovo was granted town status. On June 29, 2004 Kikerino was downgraded to a rural locality.

On August 1, 1927 Osminsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Osmino was established as well. It was a part of Luga Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. It included areas which were previously parts of Gdovsky, Luzhsky, and Kingiseppsky Uyezds. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Between March 22, 1935 and September 19, 1940, Osminsky District was a part of Kingisepp Okrug of Leningrad Oblast, one of the okrugs abutting the state boundaries of the Soviet Union. Between August 1941, and February 1944, Osminsky District was occupied by German troops. On August 2, 1961 Osminsky District was abolished and split between Slantsevsky and Volosovsky Districts. After the abortive administrative reform of the 1960s, its territory became split between Slantsevsky, Volosovsky, Luzhsky, and Kingiseppsky Districts.
