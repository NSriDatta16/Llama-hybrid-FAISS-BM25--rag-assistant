Reynold Garcia (born December 15, 1974 in Laoang, Northern Samar), known by his stage name Pooh, is a Filipino actor, comedian, impersonator, singer and host. He is known for currently starring in the comedy gag show Banana Split. He is also known for impersonating boxer and politician Manny Pacquiao.

He was the 2006 and 2007 awardee for Aliw Award best male stand-up comedian. He was again nominated in 2008.

Career
Pooh first worked at the now-defunct Nota'Kwela, a comedy bar in Caloocan. He then moved to Music Box and later to Jazz Café. He was eventually scouted by Andrew del Real of The Library.

Pooh had guested on GMA Network's SiS and in a sequence on an afternoon show of the network. He claims it was ABS-CBN that gave him the opportunity to get known to a larger audience.

The comedian became a part of the Banana Split cast; he did skits and made impersonations as part of the show. By 2013, he became known for his impersonation of Manny Pacquiao. In additional to his stint with ABS-CBN, he occasionally receives assignments abroad as a comedian and impersonator.

In the same year, he expressed contentment with his involvement in the show and wouldn't mind if he were offered additional roles or not, and would not rather force a role onto himself which he considered as not his forte. He said that he would rather not become as popular as Vice Ganda, as he wouldn't be able to handle the fame.

Comedic style
Pooh says that his forte in comedy is more on impersonations and skit-based. He said he is not comfortable using insults in doing comedy, saying that he may not handle it well and end up offending someone.
