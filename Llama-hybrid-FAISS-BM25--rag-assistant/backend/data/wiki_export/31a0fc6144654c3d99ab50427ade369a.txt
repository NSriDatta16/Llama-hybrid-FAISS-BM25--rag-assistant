Lakhan-jo-daro is an archeological site and one of the largest cities of the Indus Valley civilization. It is located within an industrial zone on the outskirts of the modern city of Sukkur and situated at the distance of mere 75 kilometers from another major city of its contemporary era, Mohenjo Daro. It covers an expanse of more than 300 hectares.

Excavation
The site, located in Sukkur District (around 100Â km away from the Mohenjo-daro site) on the right bank of the Indus River was first discovered in 1985 by Prof Qasid Mallah and his team from Khairpur University. It was excavated in 2006 by the archeologists and students of Shah Abdul Latif University. Excavations were also undertaken by Prof. Muhammad Mukhtiar Kazi of University of Sindh during 1996 and 2000. According to Dr. Mark Kenoyer, it covers an area of more than 300 hectares, as large as Mohenjo Daro (250 Ha) and was the second largest city of the Indus Valley civilization.
