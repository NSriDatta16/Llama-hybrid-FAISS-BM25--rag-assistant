History
The PNCC was established in 1966 by virtue of an executive order during the administration of the Former President Ferdinand Marcos as the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), with the corporation being led by Rodolfo Cuenca, a crony.  It was granted a 50-year franchise to commission and perform construction works throughout the Philippines.

In 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1113 was issued, granting the CDCP a 30-year franchise to operate and maintain the various limited-access toll highways in the Philippines.  The CDCP changed its name to its present name in 1983 after the infusion of additional equity from the government since 1981. The PNCC is now under the full supervision of the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry by virtue of the Executive Order 331, issued last July 16, 2004.
