Recurring segments

Ang Dating Doon

Ang Dating Doon (English: What Used to Be There) is a popular recurring segment on GMA Network's gag show Bubble Gang from 1998 to 1999. It was briefly revived in 2001 and 2005. The show experienced a resurfacing in late 2011 and is broadcast once a month. It is a parody of the longest-running religious television and radio program in the Philippines, Ang Dating Daan (English: The Old Path), which is produced by the Members Church of God International. At first, the nursery rhyme "Row Row Row Your Boat" was the opening and closing theme used from 1998 to 1999. In the same year, however, it comically began to use instead of the opening theme of the anime television series Chōdenji Machine Voltes V ("Voltes V no Uta" by Mitsuko Horie, Koorogi '73 and Columbia Cradle Club), as both its opening and closing song particularly performed by the several music groups as the guests. It was of perfect timing since it was a way of promoting Voltes V for the network back then.

Origins
The sketch was headlined by the show's writers, Isko Salvador (as Brod Pete, a play on the name of the actor Brad Pitt and a parody of Bro. Eli Soriano, Overall Servant of MCGI and the host of Ang Dating Daan), Cesar Cosme (as Brother Willy, a parody of Bro. Willy Santiago, who in 2009 broke away from MCGI and established the Members Church of God in Jesus Christ Worldwide), and Chito Francisco (as Brother Jocel, a parody of Bro. Josel Mallari). The recent popularity of the religious program Ang Dating Daan and its segment, Itanong mo kay Soriano, Biblia ang Sasagot!, (Ask Bro Eli, the Bible Will Answer!), inspired the segment. Because of its popularity, their characters became their nicknames.

Format
The segment would commonly begin and end with Voltes V no Uta as the theme song; afterward, various members of the audience would come up and present various questions to Brod Pete, who then has Brother Willy read various extracts from Nursery Rhymes or Folk songs, and recently on the 2011 revival, various song lyrics. Brod Pete will then interpret the "passage" to answer the question presented. Instead of using the Bible, they used dictionary, phone directory, or any other books. In the 2011 revival, they began to use MacBook Pros and iPads as reference materials, which leads to its new title, Ang Bagong Dating Doon (The New Formerly There), meaning "Ang Dating Doon" with the power of technology.

On the June 27, 2014, episode of Bubble Gang, the segment sported a new set, the trio now wearing suits, and the name tweaked to Ang Bagong Dating Doon International (The New Formerly There International). This change reflects the new formats of Ang Dating Daan and Itanong Mo Kay Soriano, wherein MCGI's Mass Indoctrinations and Worldwide Bible Expositions, respectively, replaced the previous ones, since Bro. Eli Soriano went into exile in 2010.

Various exclamations such as "Alien!" or Raise the Roof! would also be used (as a parody of the common exclamations Amen and Praise the Lord).

A running gag in the show is that Brother Jocel sleeps during the segment proper (he is often seen with his head resting on his arms on the desk, though this has not been the case on some episodes). In the 2011 revival and onwards, he is sometimes seen playing games with his iPad, most notably, according to him, is Temple Run, or checking his "Facebook account" for status updates (while often seen still resting his head on the desk).

Notes
 Isko Salvador and Cesar Cosme once worked on the legendary sitcom John En Marsha.
 There are also brief revivals of Ang Dating Doon since the first incarnation of the segment ended. First, when Isko Salvador went to ABS-CBN and became a regular of the gag show Klasmeyts, he revived Ang Dating Doon but with a variation. The segment features the same concept and the same usage of exclamations "Alien" and "Raise the Roof," but changes the segment title into "Doon Dati" (also meaning "Formerly There") in reference to the segment's tenure in Bubble Gang. The theme song was also changed from Voltes V opening theme to the opening theme of Tōshō Daimos ("Tate! Tōshō Daimos" by Isao Sasaki and Columbia Cradle Club). In a satire of the then-heated rivalry between Ang Dating Daan and Iglesia ni Cristo, Doon Dati has a sister segment named "May Tama Kami" ("We Are Nuts", lit. "We Are Correct"), a parody of Iglesia ni Cristo show Ang Tamang Daan. Hosted by Bayani Agbayani and Herbert Bautista, who play as parodies of Bro. Michael Sandoval and Bro. Maximo Bularan, Jr., the show focuses on rebuking Brod. Pete's teachings through nursery rhymes and children's folk tales in a similar manner to Brod Pete's.
 The comedy show Ispup made a parody of Ang Dating Daan and its rival Ang Tamang Daan entitled Ang Sangang Daan ("The Branched-Out Path"), hosted by John Lapus and Leo Martinez. It was shown on TV5, then known as ABC 5.
 There is also another segment based on Ang Dating Doon, this time calling it Ang Daming Daan ("Many Paths" or "Many Hundreds"), which was shown on ABC's gag show Teka Mona! This segment was hosted by Joey de Leon as Bro. Elvis Soriano (a parody of Bro. Eli Soriano with an Elvis Presley look), who is usually seen with his guitar, and Mike "Pekto" Nacua as Brother Hud, Bro. Elvis' Judas Iscariot-like assistant (his name was a pun on the word "brotherhood"). the concept was as same as Ang Dating Doon, except for the fact that every question is worth P100.00 and it will be put into a fishbowl after the question was answered (a parody of one of the accusations to MCGI by INC wherein Bro. Eli allegedly charges his followers with a large sum of money).
 The Trio made a cameo appearance at the film D'Sisters Nuns of the Above starring Michael V and Vic Sotto and Tweets for My Sweet.
 Despite having a show in Bubble Gang, Brod Pete (Isko Salvador) became a judge in It's Showtime.
 Brod. Pete is also a segment host for the UNTV show Klasrum (formerly as Bread Tambayan). Ironically, UNTV is the current home of Ang Dating Daan, and UNTV is operated by Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International (led by its chairman and CEO "Kuya" Daniel Razon, nephew of Eli Soriano and the Assistant Overall Servant of MCGI) which is under the Broadcast ministry of MCGI.
