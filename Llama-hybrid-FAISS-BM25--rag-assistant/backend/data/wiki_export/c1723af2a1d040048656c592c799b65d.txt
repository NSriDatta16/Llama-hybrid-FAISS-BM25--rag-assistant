The Grenaa Line () is a  long standard gauge single track railway line in Denmark which runs between Aarhus and Grenaa through the peninsula of Djursland. The railway opened in 1876–1877. It is owned and maintained by Rail Net Denmark and served with passenger trains by the Danish State Railways (DSB). It now functions as a commuter rail service in the Aarhus area and carries 1 million passengers annually.

History 

The section from Ryomgård to Grenaa was opened in 1876 together with the Randers-Ryomgaard Line. The section from Aarhus to Ryomgaard was opened in 1877. The two railways were operated by the joint operating company Østjyske Jernbane (ØJJ). Both lines were taken over by the Danish State Railways in 1885. Passenger traffic on the Randers-Ryomgaard Line ceased in 1971.

The Grenaa Line was around 2006 upgraded to support higher speeds. In 2012, eight new Siemens Desiro diesel trains started operation here and on the Odder Line, under the brand name Aarhus Commuter Rail ().
