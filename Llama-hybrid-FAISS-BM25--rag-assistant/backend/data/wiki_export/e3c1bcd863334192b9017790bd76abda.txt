Biography
Kaplan got his start as a comedian doing impressions of presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. He also impersonated a little-known journalist at the time, Dan Rather. He then started work on video games, including several Star Wars titles. From there he went on to do such shows as Power Rangers, Digimon: Digital Monsters and Transformers: Robots in Disguise. He was once a contestant on the game show Street Smarts. On that appearance, he showed off some of his other impressions, including one of Gilbert Gottfried. He was a guest to the Power Morphicon (in Los Angeles) in June 2007 and August 2010, to Armageddon (in Australia and New Zealand) in October 2007, and to AVCon: Adelaide's Anime & Video Games Festival (in Australia) in July 2018. He also created the television series The Way it WASN'T! and the graphic novel I, of the Wolf. He voices Captain Fort Worth in the adult video game BoneCraft.
