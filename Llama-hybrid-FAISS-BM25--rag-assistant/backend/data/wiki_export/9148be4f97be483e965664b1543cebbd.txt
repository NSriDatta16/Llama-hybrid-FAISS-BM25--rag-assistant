She's Strange is the tenth album by the funk band Cameo, released in 1984. It reached number 1 on the Billboard R&B Albums chart, number 27 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies. 

This album is dedicated to the late Polygram A&R representative, Bill Haywood; as Cameo mentions in the liner-notes of the album, "The album which he always wanted". The track "Talking Out the Side of Your Neck" is a commonly performed arrangement amongst marching bands, especially those from HBCUs. The titular track became the group's first number one single on the R&B charts, topping the charts for four weeks in April 1984.
