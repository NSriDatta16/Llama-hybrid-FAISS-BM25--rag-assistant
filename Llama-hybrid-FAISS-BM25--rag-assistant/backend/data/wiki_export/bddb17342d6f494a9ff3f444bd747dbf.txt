About Time is the eighth solo studio album by Steve Winwood, released in 2003. It was his first album since 1997 and it featured a return to a musical style more in line with his earlier work with Traffic.  That basic style is emphasized in the three piece set of the band: Hammond Organ, guitar and drums/percussion, joined on various tracks by saxophone, flute and additional percussion characteristic of the Traffic sound.

Critical reception

Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote of the album "Winwood's voice is now a little rough (which comes as a surprise), it nevertheless fits the scaled-down, relaxed atmosphere. And if individual songs aren't necessarily memorable, they don't necessarily need to be -- the feel is the thing here, and while it isn't first-rate Steve Winwood, it does feel like a welcome update from an old friend, which, after several years of waiting and several uneven records, is enough."
