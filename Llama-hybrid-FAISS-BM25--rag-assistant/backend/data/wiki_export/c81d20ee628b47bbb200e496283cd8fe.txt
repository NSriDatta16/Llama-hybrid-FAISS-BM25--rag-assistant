Gregory Mark Strydom (born 26 March 1984) is an international cricketer. He played 12 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Zimbabwe in 2006, and a number of T20 Internationals (T20Is) for Cayman Islands in 2019.

In 2003–04, playing for Matabeleland, he scored 128 and 104 in a game against Manicaland, an innings which included 16 sixes. Strydom had scored a career best 216 against the same opposition just three weeks earlier.
