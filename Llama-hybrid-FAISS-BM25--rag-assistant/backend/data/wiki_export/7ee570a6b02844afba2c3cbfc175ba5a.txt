Xue Zong (died 243), courtesy name Jingwen, was a Chinese poet and politician of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was known for his quick wit. On one occasion, when the Shu envoy Zhang Feng () made fun of the name of his colleague Kan Ze during a feast, he gained somewhat of a measure of revenge by making fun of Shu's name. He was also known for assisting LÃ¼ Dai in the pacification of Jiaozhi Commandery (covering parts of present-day western Guangdong, southwestern Guangxi and northern Vietnam). In 233, when Sun Quan considered an ill-advised campaign to the Liaodong Peninsula against the recalcitrant warlord Gongsun Yuan (who had submitted to him and then betrayed him and killed his envoys), Xue Zong was one of the officials who spoke against the campaign, eventually getting Sun Quan to change his mind. Xue Zong had two sons: Xue Ying and Xue Xu.
