History
The Post Office opened on 10 October 1890 and closed in 1993.

In 1914, a railway from Benalla to Tatong was opened. Timber from the surrounding hills was harvested to supply the early Melbourne power station, but coal from the Latrobe Valley became the favoured fuel source. In February 1928, staff were withdrawn from Tatong railway station. Persistent operating losses on the operation of the line led its closure in July 1947.

Tatong is the birthplace of Michael Joseph Savage, the first Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand, and Graeme Peck, male lead for the Australian Ballet Company.
