History

Olympic Beirut 
Founded as Al Majd Sports Association (), the club was renamed Olympic Beirut Sporting Club () on 4 April 2001, by Taha Koleilat. In 2001–02 the club won the Lebanese Second Division, and were promoted to the Lebanese Premier League. Koleilat allocated a budget of USD$7 million, with the goal of winning the league and building a competitive team for the AFC Cup. Having strengthened the team with the signings of Pierre Issa, Edílson, Faisal Antar, Youssef Mohamad, and Abbas Ali Atwi, among others, Olympic Beirut won the domestic double in 2002–03, winning both the league and FA Cup.

On 14 February 2003,  – which funded the club's activities – declared bankruptcy. The decline was felt the following season, in 2003–04, with Olympic Beirut being knocked out of the 2004 AFC Cup in the quarter-finals against Singaporean club Home United, and finishing the league in third place. In 2004–05 Olympic Beirut finished in fourth place.

AC Tripoli 
Prior to the 2005–06 season, Koleilat sold the club's license to former national team player Walid Kamareddine for $400,000, with the club being relocated to Tripoli. The club was first renamed Olympic, then Olympic Tripoli, and finally AC Tripoli (). The Lebanese Football Association (LFA) approved of the move on 24 November 2005.

In 2014–15 Tripoli won the Lebanese FA Cup, their first trophy under their new name. They participated in the 2016 AFC Cup where, after beating Kyrgyz club Alay Osh in the qualifying play-offs on penalty shoot-outs, they qualified to the group stage. Drawn in group B, Tripoli finished in third place out of four with two wins, a draw, and three defeats.

Starting from the 2016–17 season, Tripoli found themselves in financial issues due to Najib Mikati, the club's main funder, deciding to cut the club's salary year by year, leaving the club to rely on social donations and TV sponsorship payments.
