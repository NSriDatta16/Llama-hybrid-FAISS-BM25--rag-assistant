Robert Saitschick or Robert Saitschik (; April 24, 1868, Mstsislau, Russian Empire – February 23, 1965, Horgen) was a Swiss philosopher.

He grew up in Warsaw, where his father Morduch Zaitchik became a merchant. After graduating from the 8th grade of the 5th Warsaw gymnasium he became a member of a revolutionary circle, which led to a legal action against him in 1887 over spreading of a revolutionary poem. He left Warsaw in late December of that year and moved to Vienna.

He was a professor at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (1895–1914), Universität zu Köln (1914–1925).
