Chi Draconis (χ Dra, χ Draconis, Chi Draconis) is a magnitude 3.6 binary star in the constellation Draco. It also has the Flamsteed designation 44 Draconis.  At a distance of 27 light years, it is one of the forty or so closest stars.

Binary system

χ Draconis is a spectroscopic binary which has been resolved using speckle interferometry.  The primary is an F7 main sequence star.  The spectral type of the companion cannot be determined directly with an accuracy, but is known to be between G8 and K2 and is assumed to be K0.  The properties of the secondary suggest that it is also a main-sequence star.  The separation of the two stars varies between about  and  during the eccentric 182-day orbit.

The primary star has a mass fractionally higher than the Sun's, but is significantly larger and hotter resulting in it being 86% more luminous.  Its age is estimated to be about five billion years.

The secondary only has about three-quarters the mass of the Sun and is both cooler and smaller.  It is only about 29% as luminous.  It is calculated to be 2.13 magnitudes fainter than the primary, so it would be of sixth magnitude if visible alone.

Visual companions
Multiple star catalogues list faint widely-separated visible companion stars: a 12th-magnitude star and a 14th-magnitude star about  from χ Draconis, but only about  from each-other.  Both have much smaller parallaxes than χ Draconis and are likely to be unrelated background objects.
