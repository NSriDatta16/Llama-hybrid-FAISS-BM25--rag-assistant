Robinson Town Centre is an expansive, open-air power center located near The Mall at Robinson in Robinson Township, Pennsylvania.  Announced on June 28, 1987, and completed in 1988, it is situated nearly 15 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh along Interstate 376 (Parkway West) and Route 60.  Robinson Town Centre spurred development of the shopping districts in the western hills of Allegheny County.  The mall and town center serve as the main shopping district for residents of Pittsburgh's Airport Area.

Both The Mall at Robinson and Robinson Town Centre are owned by Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, Ohio. Other developments include The Pointe at North Fayette, Robinson Crossroads, Robinson Court, and Settlers Ridge.

The first tenants at Robinson Town Centre included a Hills discount store, Children's Palace toy store, a Dahlkemper's catalog showroom, Sears appliances, Phar-Mor drug and discount store, Pappan's Family Restaurant, Sun TV, and OfficeMax, among other small retail stores. Marshalls, JoAnn Fabrics, and TJ Maxx are among the original tenants that still exist at the centre.

This development also made way for the first IKEA store within a six-hour distance.

Other tenants today include Ichiban Hibachi, HomeGoods, Kirkland's, and Famous Footwear.
