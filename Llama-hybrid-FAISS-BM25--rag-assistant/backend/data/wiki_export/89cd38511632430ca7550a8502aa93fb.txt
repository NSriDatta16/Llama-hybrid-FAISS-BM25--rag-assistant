Martyr Worthy is a small village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Itchen Valley, in the Winchester non-metropolitan district of Hampshire, England. It is part of the Worthys cluster of small villages. In 1931 the parish had a population of 350. On 1 April 1932 the parish was abolished to form Itchen Valley.

Martyr Worthy is located on the banks of the River Itchen to the northeast of the city of Winchester.

The place-name 'Martyr Worthy' is first attested in Episcopal Registers of 1243, where it appears as Wordia le Martre. 'Worthy' means 'enclosure', and Martyr Worthy is recorded as having been held by Henricus la Martre in 1201. 'Martre' may be Old French martre meaning martyr, or meaning marten and used as a nickname

The village has a Church of England parish church – St Swithun's –  which is Grade II* listed.
