History

The name Linchmere was, in ancient times, spelled Wlenchemere.

South of the village is the remains of an Augustinian priory founded in 1200 was first known as Woolynchmere Priory and later as Shulbrede Priory. It is located  south of Linchmere village centre), and is associated with a nearly manor house and the peerage of Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede.

The settlement at Hammer took its name from an iron mill which was active there from before 1573 until at least 1730. There were also other iron works in the district including one partly in what is now Fernhurst parish, in Furnace Wood near Lower Lodge Farm, apparently started a little before 1620. The associated water supply is still named Furnace Pond and is just  south of Linchmere village centre.
