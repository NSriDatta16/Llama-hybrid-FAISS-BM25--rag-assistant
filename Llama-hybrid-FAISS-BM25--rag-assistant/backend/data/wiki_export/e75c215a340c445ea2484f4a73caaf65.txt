Baltimore Coliseum was an indoor arena in Baltimore, Maryland.  It hosted the NBA's original Baltimore Bullets from 1944 until 1954. Prior to that it hosted roller skating events.

The Coliseum was built in 1938 on the corner of Monroe Street and Windsor Avenue near the Pennsylvania Avenue entertainment area and held 4,500 people. As a professional sports venue, it had been superseded by the Baltimore Civic Center in 1961, which prompted the Coliseum's closure not long after. The building, after over four decades of disuse, was demolished in July 2008. The Center for Urban Families (CFUF) now stands on the site.
