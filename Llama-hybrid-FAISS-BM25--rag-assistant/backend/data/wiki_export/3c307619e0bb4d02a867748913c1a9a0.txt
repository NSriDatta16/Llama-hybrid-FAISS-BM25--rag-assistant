Critical response 

Educator Mary Walsh describes the scheme as one which was “strictly regulated”:  she describes the use of real stories to motivate children who were failing to learn to read on “One two three and away”. However this ignores a body of work now referred to as The Science of Reading, which outlines why children fail to learn to read and what to do about it. As children need a “foundation of phonics’ taught systematically and explicitly  this scheme should arguably not be introduced at the very beginning stages of learning to read without employing  strategies to evoke phonemic awareness and orthographic knowledge.

Other media 

An educational video edition of One, Two, Three and Away: The Village with Three Corners was also released in 1996 by First Independent Video. Directed by Mark Taylor and produced by Bristol-based animation studio A Productions, the video consisted of drawn animation sequences, on screen games and songs. It was executive produced by Dan Maddicott at United Media.

Also available are teachers' notes and activity books, wooden dolls and stamp kits.
