Early life

Kurma Venkatareddi Naidu was born on 15 May 1875 in Rajahmundry in Godavari district and belonged to a Telaga Kapu family. His father, Kurma Bapanna Naidu, won a name for himself as a Police Inspector. His mother, Venkata Ratnamma was reputed to be a pious and simple lady.

Naidu's ancestors were rich and reportedly owned two villages, Gangavaram and Kurmapuram in the Ramachandrapuram mandal of Godavari district. One of his paternal ancestors, Sambhanna Naidu, served as a military officer on the side of the English against the Dutch in the late eighteenth century and earned the title of Kumandan (Commandant) which became a family appellation.

Education 
He completed his B.A. degree from Madras Christian College in 1894 and later attended Madras Law College. Before being called to the bar in 1900, he was a Professor of Physics at the Government Arts College, Rajahmundry. He started his practice as an advocate in Rajahmundry and then shifted to Eluru.

Early political career
Naidu served on local and district boards in Rajahmundry and Eluru between 1901 and 1919. He was a member of the Justice Party right from its inception. He was a part of the Justice Party delegation to England along with Dr. T. M. Nair and Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar in July 1918. In 1919, he led the non-Brahmin deputation to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Reforms. Naidu was an active partyman and when the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms were passed in 1919, Naidu formulated a set of activities that the Justice Party should follow.

Minister in Justice Party Cabinet 
In December 1920, when the Justice Party was elected to power in Madras Presidency, Naidu won a seat in the Madras Legislative Council and served as the Minister of Development. He also served as the Minister of Industries in the government of the Raja of Panagal from 1921 to 1923, when he was dropped in favour of T. N. Sivagnanam Pillai. He remained neutral when a vote of no-confidence was passed against the government of the Raja of Panagal.

In 1924, when the Muddiman Committee came to India to assess the implementation and progress of dyarchy, K. V. Reddi Naidu explained its progress thus:

Naidu also lent his support to reduction of economic inequality in villages. A speech delivered by him in 1924 emphasised the dangers of colonial forms of property rights. In Naidu's view, "the English and Scotch land systems were based upon the Roman conception of Dominium. According to these systems, the landlord is the absolute owner of the soil. The tenant has no proprietary interest in it and has no rights whatsoever."

In 1928, Naidu was a member of the Indian delegation to the League of Nations, Geneva.

Agent to South Africa

In January 1929, Naidu succeeded V. S. Srinivasa Sastri as British India's Agent to the Union of South Africa. In January 1930, he came under severe criticism from the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) for not having done enough to protect the interests of the Indians migrants. In February 1930, the first reading of the TALT (Amendment) Bill was passed. The South African Indian Congress was severely opposed to the Bill and Naidu spoke at a meeting of the SAIC in October 1930 expressing his outrage. He was a member of the Indian delegation which participated in the Second Round Table Conference with the representatives of the South African Government on 4 January 1932. Naidu's term came to an end on 3 August 1932 and he was succeeded by Kunwar Maharaj Singh.

Acting Governor of Madras Presidency 
On leaving South Africa, he took up various positions in the Indian Government. He became a member of the Council of State from 1933 to 1934, and a member of the Governor's Executive Council, Madras, 1934 -1937. In between, he was the acting Governor of Madras Presidency from June–October 1936.

Chief Minister of Madras Presidency
Naidu was the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency from 1 April 1937 to 14 July 1937. The 1937 assembly elections were held and the results declared in February 1937. Despite being the majority party in the assembly and the council, the Indian National Congress was hesitant to form a Government because of the veto powers given to the governor. The Governor of Madras, Lord Erskine, decided to form an interim provisional Government with non-members and opposition members of the Legislative Assembly. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri was first offered the Chief Ministership of the interim government but he refused to accept it. Then Erskine formed an interim government with Kurma Venkata Reddi Naidu as Chief Minister on 1 April 1937. However the ministry was short lived as the Congress was persuaded to form the government. On 14 July, Naidu resigned and Rajaji became Chief Minister.

As a tribute to Naidu's exalted status and the high offices he held, the then European-owned Madras Southern Mahratta Railway allotted him, under instructions from the Government of India, a special salon exuding luxury whenever he travelled. This privilege was extended to very few Indians and he was the only one in the Madras Presidency to receive it. He died on 10 September 1942.
