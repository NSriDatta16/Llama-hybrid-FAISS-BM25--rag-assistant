Gsteig bei Gstaad is a municipality in the Obersimmental-Saanen administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. Gsteig was formerly known by the French name of Châtelet.

History

 
Gsteig is first mentioned in 1312 as Chastelet. In 1453, it was mentioned as Steig.

The villages of Gsteig and Feutersoey grew up along the roads over the Col du Pillon and the Sanetsch Pass.  During the Middle Ages, a castle was built in the valley to protect and control the passes.  The castle is first mentioned in 1458 and today is in ruins.  At one time there was a settlement at Ussers Gründ which was destroyed by a landslide.  Originally Gsteig was part of the district and parish of Saanen.  The village church of St. Theodul was consecrated in 1453.  It became a filial church of Saanen in 1500.  In the early 16th century, Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, however Gsteig did not convert until 1556.

Traditionally the villagers practiced seasonal alpine herding and farming and made a little money off trade over the passes.  Beginning around 1900, tourism became a major part of the local economy.  Today there are several hotels and a number of vacation homes in the municipality.  Tourist sites include the Diablerets Glacier, the castle ruins, the Arnensee and the nature preserve at Oldenhorn.
