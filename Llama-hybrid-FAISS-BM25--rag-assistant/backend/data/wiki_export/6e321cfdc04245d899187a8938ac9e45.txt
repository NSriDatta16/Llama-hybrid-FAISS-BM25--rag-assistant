History

Constructed in 1952, it was used for volleyball and basketball matches of the 1954 Central American and Caribbean Games and had seen performances of the San Francisco Ballet and New York Philharmonic in 1958. The auditorium was the venue for the gymnastics events at the 1968 Summer Olympics.

Since the 1970s, it has been used primarily for international music, song, dance and film festivals, fairs and exhibitions.

From 1988 to 1990, the auditorium went through an 18-months-long renovation, designed by architects Abraham Zaludovsky and Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon, which brought it to the current design.

It hosted the 1993 and 2007 Miss Universe pageants.

In 2007, the American magazine Pollstar made the National Auditorium a nominee for International Theatre of the Year.

In November 2007, the Auditorio Nacional won the Billboard Touring Award for best concert venue under 10,000 seats.

Auditorio Nacional houses the largest pipe organ in Latin America.

In 2016, it hosted the premiere of the largely anticipated comic-book film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.
