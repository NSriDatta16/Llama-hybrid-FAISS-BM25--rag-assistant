Australia competed at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 18 competitors, 14 men and 4 women, took part in 26 events in 6 sports.

Due to economic difficulties, Australia could only afford to send ten athletes to the Games, as the estimated cost of funding was A$720 per athlete. However, other athletes were allowed to compete on the condition that they secure private or community funding. Eight athletes were funded in this way, including Dunc Gray.
