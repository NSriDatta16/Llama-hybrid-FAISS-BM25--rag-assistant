Transcript

Khan chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

Administrative Review Board hearing

Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as "enemy combatants" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual Administrative Review Board hearings.  The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an "enemy combatant".

They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat - or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.

Khan chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.

The following primary factors favor continued detention

The following primary factor favor release or transfer

Witness at other Tribunals

He confirmed that Hamidullah had only been a teenager when he had been in the HiG, and that he had been a deserter.

Khan's age

United Kingdom newspaper, The Guardian, republished an Associated Press article, devoted to Khan, which speculated about his age.

The article says that the United States estimates Khan's age as 71.  It says that Khan doesn't know his age for sure, but believes he is about 78.  The article states that Khan requires a walker.

Return to Afghanistan

Khan was reported to have been one of five Afghans returned to Afghanistan on August 28, 2006.

Peter M. Ryan, one of Khan's lawyers, learned of his return by e-mail from the DoD, on the following weekend,   and never did learn the reason for Khan's detention.

Ryan initially expressed concerns whether Khan could expect the Afghan authorities to free him, upon his return, or whether they would put him in the Afghan prison system., but Khan did not ultimately face arrest upon his return to Afghanistan.

Guantanamo Medical records

On 16 March 2007, the Department of Defense published medical records for the detainees.
