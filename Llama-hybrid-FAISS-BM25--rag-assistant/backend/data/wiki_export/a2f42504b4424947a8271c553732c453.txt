Randol Doyle Choate (born September 5, 1975) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. The New York Yankees selected him in the 1997 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft from Florida State University. Choate made his MLB debut for the Yankees in 2000, and also pitched for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Tampa Bay Rays, Florida/Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, and St. Louis Cardinals. He won the 2000 World Series with the Yankees, beating the New York Mets.

As a left-handed relief pitcher, Choate appeared mainly in matchups against left-handed hitters. His pitching style featured a sidearm-delivery style that hid the ball effectively from left-handed hitters, while only marginally so against right-handed hitters. His repertoire featured almost exclusively a sinking fastball and slider combination.

Early life and amateur career
Choate was born in San Antonio, Texas. He attended Churchill High School in San Antonio, and was a letterman in baseball. He then attended Florida State University, where he was a third team College All-American in 1996 and a second team College All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference All-Star in 1997. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

New York Yankees (2000–03)
Choate made his Major League debut on July 1, 2000, as a member of the New York Yankees, retiring the only batter he faced in a 6–1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field. In his 22 games for the Yankees that year, Choate had a record of 0–1 with a 4.76 ERA, and was a part of the World Series-winning club.

Choate later signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins on January 9, 2007, but chose to become a free agent on March 24 after being reassigned to a minor league camp three days earlier. He signed a minor league contract to return to the Diamondbacks in April 2007, and was assigned to Tucson. The Diamondbacks purchased his contract from Tucson on June 26, 2007, but he made only two appearances before he was designated for assignment on June 28.

Milwaukee Brewers (2008)
On November 14, 2007, the Milwaukee Brewers signed him to a one-year contract. During spring training 2008, Choate broke a bone in his left hand.

Between April 25 and June 13, 2011, Choate did not allow a hit in 20 consecutive appearances, surpassing the record set by Mike Myers 11 years earlier and setting a record which still stands .

Los Angeles Dodgers (2012)
Choate was traded along with Hanley Ramírez to the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 25, 2012, in exchange for Nathan Eovaldi and minor league pitcher Scott McGough. With the Dodgers, he appeared in 36 games and had a 4.05 ERA in  innings. His combined totals for the season with the Marlins and Dodgers included 80 appearances, leading MLB, and  IP, making him the only player in MLB history with at least 80 appearances and less than 40 IP in a season.

St. Louis Cardinals (2013–15)

On December 7, 2012, Choate signed a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. On May 20, 2015, he drew a walk as a hitter for the first time in his career against the New York Mets. He earned his first save with the club in a 1–0 victory over the Atlanta Braves on July 25, 2015, getting A. J. Pierzynski to ground into a game-ending double play.

Pitching style
Featuring a sidearm-delivery style with a repertoire of almost exclusively sinking fastballs and sliders, one of Choate's strengths was inducing ground balls from left-handed hitters with runners on base, especially for double plays. In 2011, Choate's sinker induced a ground ball rate of 71.4%. His slider had broad side-to-side movement, inducing a 19.5% swing-and-miss rate. In 2011 and 2012, he produced 11.31 and 8.84 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9) rates, respectively, despite his fastball averaging just  to .

Choate has been described as "the LOOGY king" and "the loogiest loogy who ever has loogied" in The Sporting News, "pretty much the prototypical LOOGY" in True Blue LA and a "LOOGY legend" and arguably "the ultimate LOOGY" on MLB.com.
