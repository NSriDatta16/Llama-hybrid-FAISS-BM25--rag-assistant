Rosa 'Mister Lincoln', also known as 'Mr. Lincoln', is a dark red hybrid tea rose cultivar. Bred by Herbert Swim and Weeks Rose Growers in 1964, the rose was named an All-America Rose Selections winner in 1965.

History
'Mister Lincoln' was created by Herbert Swim and Weeks Rose Growers in 1964. The stock parents of this rose are the hybrid tea rose cultivars 'Chrysler Imperial' and 'Charles Mallerin'. The plant was introduced into the United States via California by Star Roses in 1965. 'Mister Lincoln' was the best-selling crimson rose in the US for many years. Known as the "California drought friendly native rose", it won the All-America Rose Selections award in 1965. 'Mister Lincoln'  was used to hybridize two new cultivars, Rosa 'Big Apple' (1983) and Rosa 'Dublin' (1983). A similar rose named Rose 'Mohammadi' with the same characteristics and fragrance was grown in City of Isfahan in Iran for hundreds of years. 'Mohammadi' ('Mister Lincoln') rose petals are used to create rose water which is used in food, desserts and as a room deodorant.
