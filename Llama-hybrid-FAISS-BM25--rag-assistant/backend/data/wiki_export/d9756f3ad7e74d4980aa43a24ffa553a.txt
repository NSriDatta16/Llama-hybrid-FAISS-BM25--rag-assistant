Production 
Woman Wanted was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba. One of the notable features of the film is that "Alan Smithee" is listed as one of the directors, meaning Sutherland effectively disowned the project. It was the last film to use the Alan Smithee credit, which was discontinued in 2000.

Reception 
The film won Best Independent Feature Film at the Ajijic International Film Festival, as well as Best Feature Film at the Slamdunk Film Festival.
