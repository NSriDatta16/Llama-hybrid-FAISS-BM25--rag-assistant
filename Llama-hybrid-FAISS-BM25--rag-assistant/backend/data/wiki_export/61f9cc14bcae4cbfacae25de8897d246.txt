"Satisfied" is the second single released from Squeeze's ninth album, Play, in the UK, and the first in the United States. Although only a promotional radio single was released in the US, the song climbed to #3 on the Modern Rock charts there. In the band's homeland, a full commercial single release failed to chart at all.
