Rocky road is a type of no-bake slice made up of milk chocolate and marshmallows along with other ingredients, which tend to vary by country. In British influenced areas, Rocky Road is a type of tiffin or traybake (other non-Rocky Road tiffins/traybakes exist but these are not called Rocky Road) but the Australian/American name is becoming more common. It is usually served in individual portions such as a brownie, or in American cuisine, as an ice cream flavor.

It is made by mixing melted chocolate with other ingredients, before refrigerating to set. It can then be cut into bars or square pieces.

History
The origin of the dessert is debated; many American companies claim to have invented rocky road in the 19th century.

The most popular version of rocky road in the U.S. is in ice cream form, which consists of chocolate ice cream, marshmallows (or sometimes a "marshmallow swirl"), and nuts.
Although not as popular, slabs of rocky road can also be found at confectioner's shops. The Annabelle Candy Company manufactures a candy bar called "Rocky Road" that has marshmallow, a thin covering of chocolate, and cashews. Betty Crocker has its own recipe for "Rocky Road".
