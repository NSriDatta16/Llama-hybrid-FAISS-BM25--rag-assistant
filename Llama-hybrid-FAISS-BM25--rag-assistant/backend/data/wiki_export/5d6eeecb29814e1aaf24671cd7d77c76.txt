Early life 
Rajeshwar Prasad Bidhuri was born in Vaidpura village in present-day Greater Noida (West) and was a member of the Bidhuri Gurjar community.

Military career 
He enlisted in the Indian Air Force. Rajeshwar Prasad, was commissioned in the General Duties (Pilot) branch of the Indian Air Force as a pilot officer on 29 October 1966.

Local residents claimed that Prasad was one of the pilots, along with Suresh Kalmadi, who bombed Mizo insurgents in March 1966 during Mizo National Front uprising. This issue was mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Parliament in Lok Sabha in August 2023. Sachin Pilot, son of Rajesh Pilot denied his father's involvement.

In late 1979, Prasad resigned his commission while posted in Jaisalmer to enter politics, under the influence of his friend Rajiv Gandhi, who later became the Prime Minister of India.

He contested the 1980 Lok Sabha elections as an INC candidate from Bharatpur, changing his surname to Pilot at the same time. Pilot emerged as a prominent Gujjar leader in India. In his first election as a candidate, Pilot defeated the former queen of Bharatpur State.
