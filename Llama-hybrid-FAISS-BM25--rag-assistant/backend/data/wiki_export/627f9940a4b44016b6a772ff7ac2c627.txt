Early life

Moloney grew up in Ilford with Irish parents . His father was from County Tipperary and his mother from County Kerry. When he was 14, he won the All Ireland Fleadh as an accordionist.

Career
Moloney was a musician on the Red Wedge tour during the 1980s.  As a member of a large Irish family in London, John learned the accordion. His first act on the comedy circuit was as the ‘angry young accordionist’.  He slowly phased out the music and focused on stand-up.

John is best known for his performances on BBC’s The Stand Up Show and the most recent series of Grumpy Old Men. He was included in BBC Channel 4’s One Hundred Greatest Stand Ups in 2006. "One of the UK's most experienced stand ups, John Moloney epitomises dry, dispassionate delivery and is a master of the droll one liner. John Moloney has also worked with comedian Bill Bailey, most notably in Bill Bailey's stand up show Part Troll where he sings the "Hokey Cokey" in the style of German electronic band Kraftwerk, during the encore."

In 2010 Moloney returned to the Edinburgh Festival with his show Butterflies With Stretchmarks, which he then toured. In 2012 he co-produced the inaugural Balham Comedy Festival. In 2015 John's BBC Radio 4 show The John Moloney Show aired in May and June. It was featured on Pick of The Week, and Pick of the Year - Radio 4's flagship entertainment guide.
