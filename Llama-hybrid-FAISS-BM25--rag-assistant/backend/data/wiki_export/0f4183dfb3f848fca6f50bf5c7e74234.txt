Salmon Creek Falls is a 120-foot (36 meter) waterfall in the southern Big Sur region of Monterey County, California. The falls are located along California State Route 1 about  northwest of Ragged Point and lies within the Monterey Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest and Silver Peak Wilderness.

Location
The falls are located along California State Route 1 about  northwest of Ragged Point. The nearest settlement is the village of Gorda, about  northwest of the falls.

Hydrology
As Salmon Creek descends a canyon along the southwestern slope of the Santa Lucia Range, it produces a series of small cataracts over a distance of  before reaching the head of the main falls. Here the water pools behind several large boulders. The creek then curves around the boulders before cascading  down a steep cliff. A shallow pool is present at the base of the falls. From here, the creek continues southwest toward the Pacific Ocean.

Access
An unpaved  trail from California State Route 1 provides access to a view of the main falls beside several large boulders. The trail does not provide direct access to the base of the falls, which requires one to scramble over a pair of boulders to reach.

The head of the falls are accessible via Salmon Creek Trail, which branches off toward the east and approaches the falls at a higher elevation. The trail is a popular access route for backpackers visiting Silver Peak Wilderness.
