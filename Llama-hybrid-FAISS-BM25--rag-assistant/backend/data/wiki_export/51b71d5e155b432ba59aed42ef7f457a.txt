Darryl Worley is the third studio album by the American country music singer Darryl Worley, released on November 2, 2004. Like his previous three albums, it was released on the DreamWorks Records Nashville label. The lead-off single, "Awful, Beautiful Life", became Worley's third and final Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs charts. "If Something Should Happen" made Top Ten on the same chart, while "I Love Her, She Hates Me" peaked at #59. After the latter single was released, DreamWorks was closed, and Worley exited for 903 music, a label started by Neal McCoy.
