"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer" is a 1971 song by Stevie Wonder, featured on his album Where I'm Coming From. The song is a ballad, describing a failed relationship using the metaphor of changing seasons. Co-written by Syreeta Wright and released on Tamla 54202 in 1971 as the flip side of "We Can Work It Out", the single stalled at #78 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it remains one of Stevie Wonder's most popular ballads to this day.  Cash Box described the song by saying that "lively melodic work is heightened by an exceptional performance."

Wonder performed a version of the song at Michael Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, his voice cracking with emotion as he called out his friend's name during the song's final refrain, "Why didn't you stay?"
