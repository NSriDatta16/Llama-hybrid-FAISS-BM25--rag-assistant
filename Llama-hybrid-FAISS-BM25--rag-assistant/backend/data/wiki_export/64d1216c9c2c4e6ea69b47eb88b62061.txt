Eryopoidea is a clade of late Carboniferous and Permian temnospondyl amphibians, known from North America and Europe. Carroll (1998) includes no fewer than ten families, but Yates and Warren (2000) replaced this with a cladistic approach that includes three closely-related families, the Eryopidae, Parioxyidae and Zatrachydidae. They define the Eryopoidea as all members of Euskelia in which the choana are relatively rounded and the iliac blade is vertical. A similar definition (without specifically naming Euskelia) is provided by Laurin and Steyer (2000).
