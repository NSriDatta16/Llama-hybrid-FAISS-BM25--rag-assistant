The Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Kuwait is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in the State of Kuwait, and head of the UK's diplomatic mission in Kuwait.  The official title is His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador to the State of Kuwait.

The Sheikhdom of Kuwait became a British protectorate in 1899 after an agreement was signed between Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah and the British government in India, due to severe threats to Kuwait's independence from the Ottoman Empire. The British government was represented by Political Agents who were appointed by the Indian Political Service until 1948, then by the Foreign Office. In 1961 Kuwait became independent and the last political agent, John Richmond, became the first British ambassador to Kuwait.
