History
The International Stoke Mandeville Games were the forerunner of the Paralympic Games and followed the vision of their creator and founder, Sir Ludwig Guttmann.

 
IWAS was formed in 2005 following a merger of the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (ISMWSF) (which was formerly known as the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMGF) and the International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD). ISOD had been founded by the International War Veterans Association in 1964.

In 2021 IWAS's Wheelchair Fencing Athletes' Council identified international representatives for a new Gender Equity Commission.
