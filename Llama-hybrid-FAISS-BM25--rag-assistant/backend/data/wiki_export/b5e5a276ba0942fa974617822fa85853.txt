The Apprentice season 5

Yazbeck was selected to appear on The Apprentice because he had been awarded the EB-1 visa green card for "persons of extraordinary ability". He won more tasks than any other Apprentice candidate and remained unbeaten as Project Manager over the 18 weeks.  He was chosen by Trump to be the winner during the show's live finale in Los Angeles.  According to Trump, Yazbeck overwhelmingly won the national vote, the first ever conducted for an Apprentice finale.   In the final task, Yazbeck was chosen to oversee a Barenaked Ladies charity concert, sponsored by Pontiac, to benefit the World Wildlife Fund. For winning the final task and being hired as Trump's Apprentice, Yazbeck chose to oversee the Trump SoHo project, with a one-year contract exceeding $250,000.
