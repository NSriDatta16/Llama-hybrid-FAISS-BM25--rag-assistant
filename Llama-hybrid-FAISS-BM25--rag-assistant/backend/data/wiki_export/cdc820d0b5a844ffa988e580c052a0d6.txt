Güdül is a municipality and district of Ankara Province, Turkey. Its area is 540 km2, and its population is 8,079 (2022). It is 90 km north-west of the city of Ankara, off the motorway to Istanbul.

Güdül is a mountainous district with a dry climate featuring cold winters (down to -20 °C), hot summers (up to 35 °C) and a little rain in spring and autumn. There is some agriculture and the  crops include hot peppers and chick peas, which are dried and sold as leblebi.

History
Research shows occupation since prehistoric times, and caves along the river Kirmir contain stone workings apparently by the Hittites (2000 BC). Later the area was occupied by Phrygians, Ancient Romans and Byzantines (one of the caves has a carved cross from the early spread of Christianity under Roman rule).

In 1071, the Byzantine armies were defeated by the Turks at the battle of Malazgirt, and soon afterwards all of central Anatolia came under Turkish control. Güdül was occupied by Seljuk Turks, including the lord of Ankara, Şehabüldevle Güdül Bey.
