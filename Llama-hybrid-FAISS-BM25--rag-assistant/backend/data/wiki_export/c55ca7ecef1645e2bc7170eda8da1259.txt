Boss is the internal name for a family of large-displacement V8 engines from Ford Motor Company intended to compete with Chrysler's Hemi and General Motors' 6.0 L Vortec engines. Originally, Ford developed the engine architecture under the name Hurricane; however, development of the engine was delayed because of its temporary cancellation in 2005. It was revived in early 2006 by Mark Fields and was given the new name of Boss in light of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In spite of this change, Ford did not officially market the engines with the Boss name in any production vehicle where they were used, instead referring to the engines by their displacement.

The first (and ultimately only) modern Boss engine, a 6.2 L V8, was produced at the Ford Romeo Engine Plant in Romeo, Michigan, from 2010 to the plant's closure in December 2022.

Ford Australia and Ford Performance Vehicles used the "Boss" name for V8 engines from 2002, but these were variations of the Ford Modular V8 with locally produced parts.

6.2 L

The  V8 is the main variant of the Boss engine. The V8 shares design similarities with the Modular Engine family such as a deep-skirt block with cross-bolted main caps, crankshaft-driven gerotor oil pump, overhead cam valve train arrangement, and bellhousing bolt pattern. In particular, the 6.2 L features a two-valve per cylinder SOHC valve train with roller-rocker shafts, hemispherical heads, and two spark plugs per cylinder, as well as dual-equal variable cam timing. Notably, it uses a much wider  bore spacing (compared to the Modular's ), allowing for the use of larger bore diameters and valves. The 6.2 L V8 has a bore diameter and stroke of . It has lightweight aluminum cylinder heads and pistons, but makes use of a cast-iron cylinder block for extra durability to meet the demands of truck use.

This V8 went into production in early 2010 and debuted in the 2010 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor as a late-availability option. A limited-edition version of the Raptor from Ford Racing called the Raptor XT features a high-output version of the 6.2 L V8 with about . For the 2011 model year, the 6.2 L V8 was introduced in the Ford F-250 and F-350 Super Duty as a replacement for both the 5.4 L Triton V8 and the 6.8 L Triton V10, and in the F-150 as the premium engine option, though it was not available in all configurations.

For 2017, the 6.2 L V8 in the Super Duty received new tuning and modified camshafts to bump torque to , while power remained at . It was also now mated to Ford's TorqShift G 6-speed transmission; Ford's Live-Drive Power Takeoff (PTO) Provision with Mobile Mode was also optional on 6.2 L equipped trucks.
