"California Saga/California" is a song by American rock band the Beach Boys from their January 1973 album Holland. It was written by Al Jardine and is the third and final part of the "California Saga" series of songs on Holland. In May 1973, a remixed version was issued as a single under the title "California Saga (On My Way To Sunny Californ-i-a)".

Recording
"California" features Brian Wilson – who was otherwise barely present at the Holland sessions – singing the opening line "On my way to sunny Californ-i-a". Jardine remembered, "We came down to the studio to do a mix-down so [Brian] could get home. Then suddenly, [he] came in and said, 'Give me a microphone.' He walked straight in. I hadn't seen him for a month. He walked up to the microphone and started singing, 'I'm on my way to sunny Califon-i-a.' He then left the microphone and walked out." Wilson corroborated this story, also dubbing the track a song to "lift your spirits up."

Former Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, who had officially left the band several months earlier, explained in a 2013 interview, "I had to secretly come down and do vocals. Al told me, 'I've got this track 'California Saga' and I want you to sing on it.' That's a cool track and I sang background on that uncredited."

Single release
In the UK, "California Saga/California" (backed with "Sail On, Sailor") was issued in February 1973 as the lead single from Holland, reaching number 75. Biographer Mark Dillon surmised that Jardine's song was chosen as a single because his 1970 production of "Cotton Fields" had been the band's last hit there.

In March 1973, the band remixed and overdubbed new vocals onto "California Saga/California" for a U.S. single release. Released in May, the single (backed with "Funky Pretty") reached number 84.  Record World said that it "has all the sound of many of their hits, complete with those legendary harmonies."
