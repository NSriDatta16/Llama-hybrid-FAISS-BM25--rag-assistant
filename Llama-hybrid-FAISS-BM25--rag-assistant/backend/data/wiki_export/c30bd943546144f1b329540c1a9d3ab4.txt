Quadrastate is a mini-album by English electronic music group 808 State. It was released in July 1989 through Creed Records. It contains the original version of "Pacific State", one of the most popular tracks by 808 State, which later made the band famous after extended airplay on BBC Radio 1 led to the band being signed to major label ZTT Records.

The record entered the Top Dance Albums chart at tenth place on 9 September 1989. It reached number one on the same chart on 4 November.

On 19 May 2008, the British Rephlex Records label re-released the record in double vinyl and CD format.

The re-issued version featured seven additional bonus tracks not included in the original. In addition, there were some alterations to the originally released version, including editing to the track "106".
