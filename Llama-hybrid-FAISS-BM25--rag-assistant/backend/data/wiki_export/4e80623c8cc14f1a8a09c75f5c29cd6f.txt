Greenville Memorial Auditorium was a 7,500-seat multi-purpose arena built in 1958 that was located in Greenville, South Carolina. It hosted local sporting events, concerts and the Ringling Brothers Circus until the Bon Secours Wellness Arena opened in 1998.

It hosted professional wrestling throughout its history, especially in the 1970s and 1980s, with NWA Jim Crockett Promotions cards held every Monday night.

It hosted the Southern Conference men's basketball tournaments in 1972, 1975, and 1976.

Lynyrd Skynyrd performed there on October 19, 1977, the last concert played by the original band prior to its fatal plane crash that took most of its members the next day en route to Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

The arena was imploded on September 20, 1997.
