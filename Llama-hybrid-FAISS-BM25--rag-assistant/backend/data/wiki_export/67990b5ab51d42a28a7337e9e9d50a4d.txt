Imogen Annesley (born 28 May 1970) is an Australian actress and director who is perhaps best known for her performances in the films Playing Beatie Bow, Howling III: The Marsupials and Queen of the Damned.

Annesley made her feature film debut as a teenager, with the leading role of Abigail Kirk in the 1986 Australian film Playing Beatie Bow. A time travel drama based on the novel by Ruth Park and directed by Donald Crombie, it was a failure at the box-office despite a number of positive reviews of the film and Annesley's performance. The film proved more popular on video release.

Her television credits include: Families, Water Rats, Farscape, Above the Law, Blue Water High and East of Everything.

Annesley is also the lady with the child in the Jimmy Barnes 1987 Australian music video, I'm Still On Your Side,  filmed at Sydney's picturesque Hawkesbury River Train Station.–here
