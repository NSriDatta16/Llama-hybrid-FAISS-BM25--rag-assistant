Purchena is a small town in Andalusia, southern Spain.  It is situated inland the county of Almería, at the foot of the Sierra de los Filabres, in the middle of the Almanzora River Valley, surrounded by woods which ascend towards the mountains, an environment which contrasts with the rest of the municipalities of the area which are set in much more arid surroundings.

History
Purchena has been populated since the Bronze Age.  It was also inhabited during the Roman period, but it was during the Arab conquest when it was most important.  In the 10th century it was founded with the name Hisn Burxana, and during the reign of Al-Ahmar I in the 13th century it was known as Val de Porchena, and it was converted into the head of the Almanzora, which formed a part of the Kingdom of Nazari of Granada. In the year 1489 the town became part of the Catholic Monarchs' empire with Baza, Guadix and Almería.

The current town took shape during the 18th and 19th  centuries around the Constitution and Larga Squares.
