Biography

Early years
Fletcher grew up in Girdwood, Alaska. She started skiing cross-country, then moved to alpine racing, GS, and Super-G. Then she tried snowboarding and focused on GS.

Snowboarding career
She competed at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Fletcher won the Olympic bronze medal in the 2006 women's Parallel giant slalom event.

Fletcher also won seven US national championships, two World Championship silver medals (1999 and 2001), eight World Cup victories, and had 20 World Cup podium finishes. She was on the USA Snowboard Team for ten years.

On March 5, 2006, in Soldotna, Alaska, Fletcher received the honor of lighting the cauldron in the opening ceremony of the Kenai Peninsula 2006 Arctic Winter Games. In 2007, she was studying to compete her degree at Eastern Oregon University.

Fletcher was inducted into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame in 2010.

Litigation
In February 2023, Fletcher and other former U.S. Ski & Snowboard (USSS) team members sued coach Peter Foley, along with the national federation, its former CEO, and the USOPC, in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles for sex trafficking, harassment, and enabling and covering up repeated acts of sexual assault and misconduct, alleging that the defendants "conspired and acted in concert with one another to commit unlawful acts." They alleged that Foley exploited his position of trust to "coerce sexual acts through force, manipulation, emotional abuse, intimidation, and retaliation." Fletcher said that Foley sexually assaulted her at a U.S. team camp when she was 19, and again at a post-race event at the Olympics. Foley and the other defendants asked the court to throw out the lawsuit; a hearing is set for October 2023.

Separately, on August 8, 2023, after an 18-month investigation, SafeSport suspended Foley for ten years for sexual misconduct.
