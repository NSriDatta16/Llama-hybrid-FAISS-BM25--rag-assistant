Pir Sultan Abdal (born Haydar) is an important religious figure in Alevism of Turkmen origin, who is thought to have been born in the village of Banaz in present-day Sivas Province, Turkey. He is considered legendary among his followers. His life is reconstructed from folkloric sources, especially religious poems which are believed to have been composed by himself and transmitted by ashiks.  

During the Ottomanâ€“Persian Wars, he supported religious heterodoxy and the political subversion of Anatolia which got him hanged.
