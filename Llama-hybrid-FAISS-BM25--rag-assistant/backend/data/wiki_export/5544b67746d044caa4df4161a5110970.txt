Puyallup High School is a high school in the Puyallup School District in Pierce County, Washington, commonly referred to as PHS.

History
Founded in 1890 as Central High School, the first nine students graduated from the school in 1893. In 1902, the first class to complete four years of high school graduated. In 1928 the new high school building was completed at an approximate cost of $30,000-$35,000. The name of the school then changed from Central High to Puyallup High School. In 1919 the school was expanded adding a junior high along with the gym and auditorium. In 1926 a total of 112 students graduated.

Fire
The next year (1927), fire hit PHS and the graduation ceremony was held at the Liberty Theater. A new and larger auditorium was added in 1935.

Earthquakes
The 1949 Olympia earthquake on 13 April 1949 was the first major earthquake to hit Puyallup High School. PHS was not spared as there was serious damage to the building and auditorium. In 1965 the school suffered from the effects of yet another earthquake and again damage was done to the school—Puyallup High School was the only school closed in Pierce County. The band was recording that day, and there are still records in circulation with the sounds of the earthquake. The Nisqually earthquake on 28 February 2001 was the next earthquake to cause damage at the school.

Renovations
The first of the major remodeling projects occurred with the main classroom building in 1971. The gym was remodeled in 1984 and the Library Science Building in 1986. The entire campus was closed during the 1993-1994 school year during a major renovation. The 1,600 students were housed in portable buildings, spare rooms in churches, and other facilities around the city of Puyallup. Walls, beams, and structures were altered or removed to improve the structure and enhance the teaching and learning methods of the day. Every effort was made to retain the original design of the structure. The old gym was lost, but a new commons area was added. Part of the front steps were removed, but the auditorium was improved while maintaining the architecture and elegance of the facility. The architectural firm of Burr, Rising, Lawrence and Bates was awarded a Historic Renovation - Citation Award in 1996 for their work on the renovation.

Academics
Academically, for the 2005–2006 school year, between the four comprehensive high schools in the Puyallup School District, Puyallup ranked 2nd, having beaten Rogers and Walker with an 87% in the reading WASL, 47% in the math WASL, 86% in the writing WASL, and 37% in the science WASL.

Daffodil Festival
Every year, Puyallup High School participates in the Pierce County Daffodil Festival. A competition is held to select the Puyallup High School Daffodil Princess who then competes, with other regional schools, for the title of Daffodil Festival Queen. The Queen title is considered the highest honor of this regional festival. The Puyallup High School marching band accompanies the float of Puyallup's princesses in the locally televised Daffodil Parade, held annually in April.

Alumni Association
The Puyallup High School Alumni Association provides scholarships to qualifying seniors. Students can apply in September directly through PHS. These scholarships are funded with proceeds from the annual dinner and auction held each December. Generous community members, alumni and philanthropists donate items for the live auction. Items are also available by raffle and silent auction. The event draws graduates and friends of PHS and is held at the Puyallup each year. Details are posted on their website linked below.
