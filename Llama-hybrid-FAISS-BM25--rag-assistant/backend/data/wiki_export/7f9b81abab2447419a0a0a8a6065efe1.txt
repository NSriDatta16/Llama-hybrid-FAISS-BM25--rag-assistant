History

The village is known to be at least 1,000 years old and is mentioned in Domesday. It lies on the south-western edge of the ancient Forest of Bowland abutting the civil parish of Bowland-with-Leagram. Leagram Park, the site of one of the medieval deer parks of the Forest, is a short drive from the village. Despite this, Chipping was not a part of the ancient Forest and its manor did not fall within the powerful Lordship of Bowland.

Chipping really thrived during the Industrial Revolution when there were seven mills located along Chipping Brook. The last survivor was Kirk Mill, the chair making factory of HJ Berry, but in 2010 the company went into administration, the factory closed, and on 7 March 2011 the works were bought by 53N Bowland Ltd.

Origin of the name
Chipping is named in the Domesday Book as Chippenden; the name is derived from the medieval Chepyn meaning market place.  Chipping is a prefix used in a number of place names in England, and is probably derived from , an Old English word meaning 'marketplace', though the meaning may alternatively come from (or via) the Medieval English word  with a more specific  meaning of 'long market square'.

Local government
Chipping is a civil parish, and formerly an ancient parish that also included Thornley-with-Wheatley, which became a separate parish in the 19th century.  Chipping was in Clitheroe Rural District from 1894 until the reorganisation of local government in 1974,

It is now in Ribble Valley, a non-metropolitan district formed in 1974.  The parish of Chipping is combined, with Bowland-with-Leagram and Bowland Forest High, into the ward of Chipping, which elects one councillor to Ribble Valley Borough Council.  Local elections are every four years.

Chipping is part of the Longridge with Bowland ward of Lancashire County Council and is in the Ribble Valley parliamentary constituency.  At all three levels of government (district, county and parliament) Chipping is represented by the Conservative Party ().

Religion

The village contains the Anglican Church of St Bartholomew and the Roman Catholic Chapel of St Mary, as well as a Congregational chapel.

St Bartholemew's
St Bartholomew's is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is united with that of St Michael, Whitewell.  The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.

The ancient yew tree in the churchyard is well known in the county and thought to be more than a century old.

St Mary's
Until the Protestant Reformation all the people of the village worshipped at St. Bartholomew's. Those who remained devoted to the Roman Catholic Church practiced their religion in secret, although there was a Mass centre at Leagram Hall where the family remained Catholic.

By the beginning of the 19th century Catholics were now able to openly attend the chapel at Leagram. In the 1820s George Weld, who was squire of Leagram, donated land in the village for the construction of a church, a school, a priest's house and a cemetery. St Mary's Church was built at a cost of £1,130 (equivalent to £ in ) The day school, also built on the site, remained in use until 1967 when the new school was built. The old school is now a community centre for all the people of the village. In 1999 the church was fully redecorated and rearranged. The Priest in Charge is Fr. Anthony Grimshaw.

The organ was reputedly bought from Stonyhurst College in 1872 and it has been dated by experts from Preston and District Organist Association to be early 18th century, by Bishop Ltd of Ipswich. It was originally hand blown and contains 650 pipes. In 1944, when electric light was installed, a plate confirming its builder was discovered. It was further renovated in 1952, when an electric blower was installed, and a further inscription was found clarifying the re-building of the organ in 1872 by Henry Ainscough.

Congregational Chapel

The chapel now known as the Congregational Church was built in 1838 for use as an independent non-conformist place of worship. The dedication stone, on the front of the building, bears the inscription: PROVIDENT CHAPEL ERECTED BY SUBSCRIPTION MDCCCXXXVIII. After about 40 years the chapel declined. It closed in 1882 and remained so for about 18 years. After extensive restoration and cleaning, by members of the Grimshaw Street Congregational Church in Preston, however, it re-opened as a Congregational Church.

The church is currently active, with an average attendance at Sunday worship of approximately 60 with around 20 children meeting for Sunday school. It meets twice on a Sunday, in the morning and evening, and runs various groups for both young and old within the community.
In January 2014, the church appointed its first Pastor in over 50 years.

Landmarks
