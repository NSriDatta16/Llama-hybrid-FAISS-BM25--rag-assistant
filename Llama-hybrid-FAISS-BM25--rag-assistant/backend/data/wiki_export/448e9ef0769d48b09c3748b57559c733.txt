Lick Mill station is a light rail station operated by Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA).  Lick Mill is served by the Orange and Green light rail lines.

Lick Mill is VTA's recommended transfer point for Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) commuter rail and Capitol Corridor inter-city rail trains at Santa Clara â€“ Great America station. Despite the similar names, VTA's Great America station is not the connection point, because it is about  away from the ACE/Capitol Corridor station, while Lick Mill station is only  away. The path between the VTA station and the ACE/Capitol Corridor station is well signed but is not wheelchair accessible because of a staircase.

Lick Mill is closed for up to 60 minutes after the events at the nearby Levi's Stadium to prevent crowds from overwhelming the station. VTA's Great America station (which is located closer to the stadium) has additional facilities to handle large crowds.
