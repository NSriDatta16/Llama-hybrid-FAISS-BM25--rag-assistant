College career
During his successful career at Pitt, Zavackas was known as one of the most intelligent, hardworking team players in the Big East Conference.  Zavackas was a key component in Head Coach Ben Howland's transformation of the Panthers into a level of league elite status.  The season before Zavackas arrived, Pitt finished the Big East season in 11th place with a 5–13 record (14–16 overall).  During Zavackas' four years the Panthers captured two regular season Big East Titles, played in three Big East tournament (BET) Championship games and captured one BET Championship.  Pitt also played in one National Invitation Tournament and two NCAA Tournaments (advancing to the Sweet 16 round both times) with Zavackas at power forward position.

Zavackas scored 1,099 points for the Panthers which currently places him 31st on Pitt's All Time scoring list.  His .807 free throw percentage is good enough for 5th place in Panther history.

Unfortunately, many Pittsburgh fans only remember Zavackas for removing his shoes and refusing to play in the waning minutes of an NCAA Tournament game.  That game, versus Marquette, would be his last career college game.
