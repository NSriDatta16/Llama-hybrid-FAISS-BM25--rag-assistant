Wynigen is a municipality in the administrative district of Emmental in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History

Wynigen is first mentioned in 1185 as Winingen.  Bickigen village was first mentioned in 1261/63 as Bicchingen.

The oldest evidence of humans in the municipal area are some Hallstatt culture grave mounds on the Füstlenberg and some La Tene culture graves in Bickigen.  Other traces of prehistoric settlements include the earthen fortifications at Heidenstatt and the fortresses at Grimmenstein, Friesenberg and Schwanden.  The first time the village is mentioned it belonged to the Zähringen Dukes.  After their line died out in 1218 it was inherited by the Counts of Kyburg.  By 1261-63 it was part of the officium Gutisberg.  Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) families in Kyburg service built castles in the area and helped guard other Kyburg lands.  The Lords of Wynigen, the Fries of Friesenberg and the Lords of Grimmenstein all held Kyburg fiefs in the area.  During the 13th century all three families drew closer to Bern and eventually became citizens of Bern or Thun and lost their Kyburg fiefs.  In the 14th century, all three of these families died out.

During the Burgdorf war, in 1383-84, between the Counts of Kyburg and the city of Bern, the Counts lost all their land in Wynigen.  Bern besieged the castles and destroyed Friesenberg and possibly Schwanden.  However, at Grimmenstein Castle, the garrison surrendered and handed the castle over to Bern.  In 1402, the Kyburg's were forced to sell the low court at Bickigen-Schwanden to Burgdorf and their fields and forests in Wynigen to Petermann von Rohrmoos who held Grimmenstein for Bern.  In 1406, Bern outright annexed the villages and incorporated them into the County of Wangen.  In 1431 it was transferred to the Burgdorf District.  Then, in 1497, Bern bought the Herrschaft of Wynigen and Grimmenstein Castle.  Five years later the villages and castle were given to the Bernese Schultheiss of Burgdorf.

The village church was first mentioned in 1275.  The original building was replaced with a new church in the 16th century, which in turn was rebuilt in 1671.  The chapel of Friesenberg Castle in Kappelen was the parish church for a parish that was independent of Wynigen's parish.  The chapel remained independent until after the Protestant Reformation, after which it apparently was abandoned and fell into ruin.

By the 13th or 14th century there were a number of large farms that raised both grain and livestock around the village.  Despite good transportation links on the Burgdorf-Langenthal road and a rail station on the Olten-Bern railway, the village remained largely rural and agricultural.  Every factory that opened in the village either moved to a neighboring town or went bankrupt.  The only exceptions were dairy factories in Friesenberg, Breitenegg and Wynigen which produced cheese from milk from local livestock.

The Wynigen school district includes Wynigen, home to a secondary school since 1835, Kappelen, Mistelberg and Rüedisbach.  However, as a response to falling enrollment, in 2007 only the schools in Wynigen and Kappelen remained open.

In 1550 Bickigen village was only a couple of farm houses, but by 1764 Bickigen and Schwanden had a total of 106 inhabitants.  In 1832 the villages of Bickigen and Schwanden became the municipality of Bickigen-Schwanden.  However, political independence did not last long and in 1911 its 147 residents became part of the political municipality and parish of Wynigen.  In 1928 the power company BKW built an electrical substation at Bickigen which is a hub in the Swiss and European grid.

Historically, Brechershäusern was not part of the Kyburg officium Gutisberg, the resident were citizens of Burgdorf.  In 1312, they granted some of the land in the hamlet to Fraubrunnen Abbey.  Until 1887, the hamlets of Brechershäusern, Rain, Buchengasse and Heuweg were part of the parish of Koppigen and formed an enclave in Wynigen.  The four hamlets formed an independent political municipality with 118 inhabitants in 1880.
