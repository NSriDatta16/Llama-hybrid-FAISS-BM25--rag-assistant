Blood, Sweat & Tears 3 is the third album by the band Blood, Sweat & Tears, released in June 1970.

History
After the huge success of the previous album, Blood, Sweat & Tears 3 was highly anticipated and it rose quickly to the top of the US album chart. It contained two hit singles: an arrangement of Carole King's "Hi-De-Ho", and "Lucretia MacEvil", written by singer David Clayton-Thomas. As with their previous album, this one relied mostly on songs borrowed from outside writers. However, It received fewer favorable reviews.

Reception

Village Voice critic Robert Christgau panned David Clayton-Thomas's singing as "belching", while calling "Symphony for the Devil" a "pretty good rock and roll song revealed as a pseudohistorical middlebrow muddle when suite-ened." Allmusic's William Ruhlman called the album "a convincing, if not quite as impressive, companion to their previous hit. David Clayton-Thomas remained an enthusiastic blues shouter, and the band still managed to put together lively arrangements... although their pretentiousness, on the extended "Symphony/Sympathy for the Devil," and their tendency to borrow other artists' better-known material rather than generating more of their own, were warning signs for the future."
