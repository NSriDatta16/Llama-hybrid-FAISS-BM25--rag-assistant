Alnes is a small village in Giske Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.  It is located on the (isolated) north side of the island of Godøya, about  northwest of the village of Leitebakk.  The rest of the island's population is located on the southern half of the island, separated from Alnes by a large mountain.  Alnes is accessible through a tunnel through the mountainous center part of the island. It is possible to reach from Ålesund by city bus.

The predominant feature of the village is the Alnes Lighthouse which was built in 1876. The lighthouse is still in operation and it is accessible for tourists. It also houses an art gallery and a small historical museum.  

There is also the old road along the North coast, now closed for the car traffic (cyclists and walkers only).  It has two tunnels of its own.

In 2006, the population was 205, but as the population dropped below 200 the next year, so Alnes is no longer counted as an urban settlement and so the population is no longer tracked by Statistics Norway.
