McPhee, McPhie, MacPhee or Macphee is a Scottish surname. Like MacFie, it is usually regarded as a shorter version of McDuffie, which is an anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic name mac Dhuibhshithe ("descendant of the dark fairy") and originated in Colonsay. However, it may instead be derived from another Gaelic name, mac a' Phì; hence it may have the same origins as surnames such as Fee, MacFee, McFee, Macfee, MacAfee and Mahaffey.
