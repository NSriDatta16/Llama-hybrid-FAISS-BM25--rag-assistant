M. Dale Skeen (born c. 1955) is an American computer scientist. He specializes in designing and implementing large-scale computing systems, distributed computing and database management systems.

Life
Skeen earned a B.S. in computer science from North Carolina State University in 1978 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1982 from the University of California, Berkeley  in distributed database systems.

He began his career in 1982 at the Computer Corporation of America in Cambridge, Massachusetts, before working as an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Computer Science department, during which he also worked as a technical consultant for Bell Laboratories.
Skeen then held a research staff member position at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California.

In 1986, Skeen worked at  TIBCO Software in Palo Alto, California, becoming the vice president of research and principal inventor of “The Information Bus” data integration backplane.

Skeen co-founded Vitria Technology in October 1994 with his wife, JoMei Chang, and served as chief technology officer.
Vitria started as a business process management company and then developed operational intelligence products. 
Skeen was interviewed in the press.

He has patents on the distributed publish/subscribe communication mechanism and three-phase commit protocol. 
Skeen received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2001 for “fundamental contributions in publish-subscribe communications.”

In April 2004 he became chief executive officer of Vitria.
