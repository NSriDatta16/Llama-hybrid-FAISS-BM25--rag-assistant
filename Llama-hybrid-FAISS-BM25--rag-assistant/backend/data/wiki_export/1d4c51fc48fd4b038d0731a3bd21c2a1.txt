St Andrew's School for Girls is an independent Christian girls school day and boarding school and co-educational preschool in Johannesburg in the Gauteng province of South Africa. The school has a student body of around 1100 girls.

History

St Andrew's School for Girls was founded in 1902 by two young Scottish women, Jean Fletcher and Jessie Johnson. Initially St Andrew's was situated in Hospital Hill in an area now called Houghton. The two Scottish women later bought Bedford Court, a large farm previously owned by a mining mogul of his time - Sir George Farrar. The house which is situated on Bedford Farm was designed by Sir Herbert Baker and still stands today as a heritage building.

The school motto, Per Angusta Ad Augusta, has the meaning 'Through trials and tribulations to glory'. The school philosophy is "Skilled for Life".

Academics 
St Andrew's pupils write the Independent Examinations Board exams each year. The majority of students continue with tertiary education in South Africa or abroad. St Andrewâ€™s strength lies in its staff/pupil ratio, with classes rarely exceeding 27 girls.
