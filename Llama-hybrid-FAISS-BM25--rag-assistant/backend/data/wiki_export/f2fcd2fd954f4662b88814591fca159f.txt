Early life and education 
He was raised in Kitchener, Ontario, where he attended Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School and met his future wife. He later studied television broadcasting at Mohawk College in Hamilton.

In 2014, he publicly called for the "Much" television channel to return to the hands of Moses Znaimer.
