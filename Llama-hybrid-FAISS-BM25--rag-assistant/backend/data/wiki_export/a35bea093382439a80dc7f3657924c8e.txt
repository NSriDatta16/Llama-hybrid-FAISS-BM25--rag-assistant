History

Early years
The airport was built during the 1950s as a replacement for the old Brno airport located in Slatina (northeast of Tuřany airport). In 1967, a new departure hall construction began. During the 1980s, the airport was handed over for use by the Czechoslovak air force, and civil operations were reduced to a minimum. Civil flights were operated during exhibitions and fairs taking place at Brno Exhibition Center. In 1986, the new departure hall and related facilities were completed. After the fall of communism in 1989, the airport returned to civil use, and was operated by the state-owned Czech Airport Authority.

Latest developments
At present, the South-Moravian local government owns the airport, and it is operated by a private company, Brno Airport Ltd. In November 2017, Brno Airport Ltd. was bought by the investment group Accolade.

The regional government of South Moravia Region entered negotiations on new routes, namely to Rome, Barcelona, Milan, and Lviv, in late 2017. As a result, a new airline company, Blue Air Moravia, was established owned jointly by city of Brno and the regional authority (35%) and the parent company Blue Air (65%), headquartered in Bucharest, Romania. However, this was cancelled and the airport was bought by Accolade Holding.

Facilities
The terminal consists of two concourses. The new departure hall that opened in 2006 is capable of handling 1,000 passengers per hour. The building was designed by architect Petr Parolek and is considered to be one of the most significant projects of Czech contemporary architecture and a striking example of the growing trend of organic architecture.

The airport offers some bars, a duty-free shop, car rentals, ATM and exchange office. The airport is covered by a free WiFi.

Cargo airlines such as ASL Airlines Belgium, Volga-Dnepr, or Antonov Design Bureau often use Brno Airport as one of their stopover points. The airport handled 9,679 tons of freight in 2009. Plans for building a new cargo terminal and industry zone are in talks of realization, which could take place in the near future.
