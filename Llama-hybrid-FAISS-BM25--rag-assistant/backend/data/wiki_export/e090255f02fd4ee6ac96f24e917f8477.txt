Bisera Alikadić (born 8 February 1939) is a contemporary Bosnian poet and author, best known best for her work Larva and Krug. She mostly writes romance novels as well as children's books. She was one of the first Bosnian women to publish romance novels. Her books Grad hrabrost (English: The City of Courage) and Knjiga vremena (English: Book of Time) express the city of Sarajevo's struggle during the Bosnian War of the 1990s.

Alikadić was born in the village Podhum near Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina. She is a member of the Writers' Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Her books and poems have been translated into English, German, French, Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish and Italian.

On 4 December 2014, a "literary portrait" of Alikadić was inducted into the Museum of Literature and Performing Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
