Geneva Steel company 
Cannon played a pivotal role in the purchase of Geneva Steel from U.S. Steel in 1987. After that transaction, he became chairman of Geneva Steel. The company twice filed for bankruptcy, most recently in 2002, when Geneva Steel closed.

The equipment was sold, but the steel plant in operation at one site since 1942 leaves other assets to sell and issues to settle. The Geneva Steel site will require up to $42 million in environmental remediation efforts, as the soil and water of the site are heavily polluted.

As recently as 2018 he was listed as the CEO of the Fuel Freedom Foundation.
