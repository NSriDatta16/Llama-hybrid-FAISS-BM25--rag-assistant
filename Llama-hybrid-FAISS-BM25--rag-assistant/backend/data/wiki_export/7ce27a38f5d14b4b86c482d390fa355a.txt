Biography
Christian was born in Newport News, Virginia in 1947. He began his broadcasting career at WWBT in Richmond, Virginia as a news reporter, covering state and local politics, the public school system, and landmark cases in the Fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals. His first stint as a weatherman came in 1975, in Baltimore, Maryland, when he was hired by news director Ron Kershaw at WBAL-TV to join the station's Action News team which included Sue Simmons, Mike Hambrick, Ron Smith, Curt Anderson and Joe Krebs.

From there, Christian moved to New York City's WABC-TV, where he served as a general assignment reporter, weatherman and sportscaster for Eyewitness News from 1977 to 1986. In August 1986, Christian joined Good Morning America as their weather forecaster. In addition, he occasionally traveled throughout the United States and abroad, reporting on a wide range of topics from current events to human interest stories.

From 1992 to 1993, Christian was also seen on the BET cable network as the host of the music game show Triple Threat.

For decades, Christian had a serious gambling addiction. He describes his addiction and his recovery in his 2018 book, You Bet Your Life: How I Survived Jim Crow Racism, Hurricane Chasing, and Gambling.

Christian left Good Morning America at the end of 1998 and began doing weather forecasts at KGO-TV in San Francisco, California in January 1999, a position he holds to this day. He was host of HGTV's Spencer Christian's Wine Cellar from 1995 to 1999.
