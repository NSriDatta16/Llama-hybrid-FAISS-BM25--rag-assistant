Waddington is an Olde English surname of Anglo-Saxon English origin. It is thought to derive from the Old English pre 7th Century personal name "Wada", plus "-ing", meaning the tribe or people of", and "tun or ham", a settlement; and hence, "The settlement of the Wada people". It may be connected to be connected with the pre-7th century Old English name "Wade", and the verb "wadan" (wada) meaning "to go", or as a habitational name from the Old English word "(ge)waed" meaning "ford".

Origins and variants 
Wadington, Waddington, Wodington, Wadiham, Wadyngton, and Waddingham, this is an English locational surname, derived from the Olde English name Wadingtun or Wadingatun. It originates from any or all of the villages called Waddington in Lincolnshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Waddiham in Lincoln. Waditun (Waddington) an ancient hamlet at Craven in Yorkshire (quoted in Domesday Book A.D. 1086 as Widitun). When Surnames were first adopted, some 1,000 years ago, it was in or near this Hamlet or Village that the ancestors of all those who now bear its name (Waddington) resided and are of the Divine Stock of Woden." The surname Waddington was first found in Yorkshire where they were Lords of the manor of Waddington, a village and parish near Clitheroe. "It is natural to find the name crossing the border into Lancashire. This surname has ramified very strongly in the Northern counties." Indeed another source claims the family did in fact originate in Lancashire: "The Waddingtons, who are also established in Lancashire, have their principal home in the West Riding, where occur a village and a seat of the name." The Canterbury Journal states : "The Waddingtons are, we have heard, of Saxon origin, being like the "Guelphs" lineal descendants from the renowned "Woden" (70 B.c.) as also from the Ferrands of Gas-cony, a house which in the 12th century gave Kings to Portugal."

Wada Dux 
The Ancient clan chief Odin (b. circa 210 AD), Woutan or Woden, was treated like a God by the Northern Races. The Historical Odin was chief of the AEsir Tribe, who were based in Sweden. His sons became the Kings of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. Descendant of Odin (Wodin/Waegdaeg/Wihtlaeg/Witta/Wihtgils/Hengest/Hartwake/Hattwigate/Hulderic/Bodic/Bertold/Sighard/Dieteric/Wernicke) was Wada Dux; an Anglo Saxon Chief of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and founder of the Township of Waddington and from whom the name of Waddington is derived. The name signified the town (ton) of the children (ing) of Wada. Wada's Father was said to be King Wernicke (sometimes written as Warnechin, Warnikind, Vellikinus), 10th King of Saxony. His Brother is said to be the famous clan leader Wudikind, who fought Charlemagne. Eardwulf of Northumbria fought a battle at Billington Moor against a nobleman named Wada in 798 AD, who had been one of those who killed King Æthelred I of Northumbria.The Waddington name may be traced in such places as "Wad-how, Wadsworth, Paddington, and strange as it may seem, in Padiham, the abode of Wada, since Pada and Wada were only variations of the same word. Their possessions extended over a large part of Yorkshire and Lancashire",

In 798 A.D. Wada Dux and his wife Bell had issue son called Wade (Wada). The principal seat of the Waddingtons was at Waddington, near Clitheroe.  Chief of the region circa 1187 AD was Walter Wadingaton and his wife Goda. Their son, also named Walter, had several children including Alice; who would go on to marry Sir Roger Tempest of Bracewell. Lands belonging to, or leased from land owners or the King by the Waddington family included Slaidburn, Bolton-by-Boland, Downham, Rimmington, Barshall Eaves, Chaigley, Edisford, Read, Padham, Altham, Clayton-le-Moors, Rishton, Accrington, Haslingden and Hoddlesden.
