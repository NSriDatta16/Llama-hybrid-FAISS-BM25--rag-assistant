Fredonia High School is a public high school in Fredonia, New York.

The Fredonia Central School District owns two campuses, Wheelock and the Main Campus, but the entire student population is currently at the Main Campus due to declining enrollment. The Wheelock building housed the entire school district until there was not enough room for the large incoming classes. When the school was at Wheelock, Fredonia's yearbook was called The Hilltopper which has led people to believe that this was actually the school mascot, however, the mascot has always been the Hillbilly. The graduating class of 2006 had 145 students, but the 2012 graduating class had approximately 100.
