Vahina Giocante (born 30 June 1981) is a French actress.

Career
As Marie in Marie Baie des Anges (1997), she is among a group of young wanderers who become enmeshed in love, hate, and violence on the French Riviera.

In 1999 she appeared in No Scandal () directed by Benoît Jacquot.

In the 2004 film directed by Ziad Doueiri, Lila Says (French title: Lila dit ça), Giocante portrays a teenager who resides with her aunt in a rough neighborhood in Marseilles. Chief film critic for The New York Times A.O. Scott compared her to Brigitte Bardot in And God Created Woman, being a femme more vital than fatale. He further wrote that Ms. Giocante's intoxicating mixture of gamine innocence and womanly knowingness is almost too much for the movie but her charisma.......give it a mood that is at once breathlessly romantic and cannily down to earth.

In 2009 she appeared in Bellamy, the last film of celebrated French director Claude Chabrol.

Personal life
Vahina Giocante is of half Corsican and half Andalusian origin. She lived on Corsica until the age of 10. Born in Orléans, she went to school at the Lycée Paul-Cézanne in Aix-en-Provence.
