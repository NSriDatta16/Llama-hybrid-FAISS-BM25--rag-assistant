Mata Tripta  (1446–1522; Punjabi: ਮਾਤਾ ਤ੍ਰਿਪਤਾ; mātā tripatā) was the mother of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism.

Biography

Early life 
Tripta was born in 1446 to a father named Bhai Raam, a Jhangar Khatri from the village of Chaliawala (or Chahal), near Lahore, and her mother was Mata Bhirai. She was born in a Hindu family. She had a brother named Krishan. She is said to have possessed a kind-hearted and soft-spoken disposition. She is further described as being a "simple, humble, kind and humane lady".

Marriage 
In 1460 she was aged eleven, she was wedded to Mehta Kalu.

She gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Nanaki in 1464. Due to the birth of a girl child as the first-born and the resultant disappointment of her husband, Mata Tripta started becoming more fervently religious in-order to please the deities in hopes for a son. Mata Tripta gave birth to Guru Nanak Dev on 23 November 1469, in the village of Rai Bhoi Di Talwandi, some thirty five miles west of Lahore in the Sheikhupura district of Punjab, Delhi Sultanate (modern day Punjab, Pakistan). The name of the town was changed to Nankana Sahib in honour of the Guru.

Death 
Tripta died in Kartarpur at the age of 76 shortly after the death of her husband Kalu.
