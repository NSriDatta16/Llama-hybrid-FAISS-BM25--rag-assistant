The Zhejiang University of Technology () is a public research university in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. It is considered one of the top industrial universities in mainland China and the second largest university in Zhejiang Province after the more comprehensive Zhejiang University.

Engineering, especially chemical and biological engineering, are its strongest disciplines. During the 1980s it made an effort to become a comprehensive technological university instead of a technological college. It keeps a close and broad relationship to the industry.

It is a typical technical university of the new generation in China. It followed the trend during the 1980s and 1990s of Chinese technical institutes changing from the Soviet specialized style into a much more comprehensive style.
