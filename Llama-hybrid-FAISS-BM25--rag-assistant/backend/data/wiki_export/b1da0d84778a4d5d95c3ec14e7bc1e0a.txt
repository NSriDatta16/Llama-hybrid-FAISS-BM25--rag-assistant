The Crandon International Off-Road Raceway is a short course off-road racing racetrack, located near Crandon, Wisconsin, United States on U.S. Route 8. The course hosts the World Championship Off-Road Races, Red Bull World Cup, Forest County Potawatomi Spring Brush Run Races, and Lucas Oil Midwest Short Course League points races. The track is a non-profit entity, run by a board of directors, with president Cliff Flannery.

Track layout
The track started out as a  long off-road track. The track was shortened to . In 2002, a shortcut through the track was installed to allow a  long lap. This allowed spectators to see the entire track, and it is utilized for selected events.

Races are started with a "land rush" start. The vehicles are started side by side in a standing start.

World Championship Off-Road Races
The "World Championship Off-Road Races" were first held in a  race on a 25 mile course in 1970.  The event takes place on Labor Day weekend. Numerous sanctioning bodies have sanctioned the event.  It was sanctioned by SODA until  WSORR took over the sanction until 2007.  CORR sanctioned in 2008, and after it folded, the Traxxas TORC Series sanctioned the 2009 event. All of the classes compete for a class world championship.

There is a separate overall world championship race. The race pits 2 wheel-drive (Pro 2) Trophy Trucks against 4×4 (Pro 4) trucks with the exception of the 2009 event, won by Kyle LeDuc, that featured Pro 4 trucks only. The 2WD trucks start ahead of the 4×4 trucks by a distance or time that has varied over the years. Scott Taylor was the first driver to pilot a 2WD truck to victory with victories in 2002 and 2008. In 2011, Chad Hord became the second driver to win the fall cup race in a two-wheel-drive Pro 2 truck. CJ Greaves is the only driver to win the race in both a Pro 2 (2013, 2018) and in a Pro 4 (2015).  In 2010, AMSOIL took over title sponsorship of the shootout race from BorgWarner and the race was known as the AMSOIL Cup until 2019 when it was renamed the Red Bull Crandon World Cup. In some years, truck drivers from lower classes were allowed to compete along with the trophy trucks. With three wins each, Rob MacCachren (1999, 2000, 2001), Scott Douglas (1997, 2006, 2010), and CJ Greaves (2013, 2015, 2018) are the event's winningest drivers. Johnny Greaves (2004, 2007), Kyle LeDuc (2009, 2014), and Scott Taylor (2002, 2008) are the other multi-time winners. 

In some years of the 1970s, the prize money was split between all finishers or all division winners, on those years the driver with the fastest time is listed. Winners of the Red Bull Crandon World Cup:
