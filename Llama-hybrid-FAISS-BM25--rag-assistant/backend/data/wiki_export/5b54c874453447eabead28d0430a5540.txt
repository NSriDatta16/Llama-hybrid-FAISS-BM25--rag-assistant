Extra Foods (also branded as extrafoods) is a supermarket chain, part of Loblaw Companies Limited. There are 4 stores in Canada, mostly in Western Canada. Most Extra Foods stores are smaller than its sister chain, Real Canadian Superstore, and most locations are in smaller, rural communities. Extra Foods is similar to Ontario's Your Independent Grocer/Zehrs banners, as well as Quebec's Provigo banner.

In 2008, Loblaw began converting some locations to the similar No Frills format already used for the company's deep-discount stores in Ontario.

In 2010, Loblaw began converting some locations to a new format similar to the "Great Foods" stores found in Ontario, some of which have since converted to Your Independent Grocer. Mostly due to not meeting sales expectations. In 2017, the chain's last Regina location was replaced by a new Real Canadian Superstore on the same property.
