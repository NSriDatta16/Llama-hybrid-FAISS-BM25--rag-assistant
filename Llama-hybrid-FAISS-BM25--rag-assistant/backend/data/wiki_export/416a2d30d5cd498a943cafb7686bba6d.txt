They are categorised as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are a further four species of lemur on the island; the eastern woolly lemur (Avahi laniger), white-fronted lemur (Eulemur albifrons), black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) and gray mouse-lemur (Microcebus murinus).
