Bogdan Dzakovic is a 14-year veteran of the Security Division of the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. 

He started off his FAA career as a field agent and Federal Air Marshal, then served as a Team Leader in the Air Marshal program. Since 1995, he had served as a Team Leader of the FAA's Red Team, which conducted undercover tests on airport security through simulated terrorist attacks.  

Dzakovic testified before the 9/11 Commission, discussing his experience as well as FAA failures that contributed to the September 11th attacks.

In 2016, he published a book, Fortress of Deceit: the Story of a 9/11 Whistleblower , which examines the root cause of the government failures leading up to the attacks,  as well as its nefarious aftermath which we are living through today.
