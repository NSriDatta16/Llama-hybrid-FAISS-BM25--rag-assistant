In Burmese mythology, the thayé (), also spelled 'tasei' (), are deceased evil people condemned to be disembodied spirits. They often appear as tall, dark people with huge ears, long tongues, and tusk-like teeth. Thayé enter towns at noon or at night, and usually cause minor illnesses.

The thayé is said have many faces and bodies; e.g., one might be a pregnant ghost with a fat white body and big ears. Others may be tall and slim, male, or with other varying characteristics.
