Trumbull High School is a large public high school located in Trumbull, Connecticut. The current principal is Todd Manuel.

History

Trumbull High School was founded in 1961 following a population increase in Trumbull during the 1950s. It was originally located at 4630 Madison Avenue, in the building currently serving as Madison Middle School. As the 1960s progressed, the town was compelled to commission a new high school to accommodate further population growth.

In 1971 a new school was constructed at 72 Strobel Road, offering a then-modern auditorium (originally designed as a lecture hall), two-story media center, and athletic complex. Middlebrook Junior High School was converted to Middlebrook Elementary School, and the Madison Avenue complex was converted to Madison Junior High School.

Trumbull High School housed grades 10–12 until 1987–1988 when ninth-graders were moved to the high school, and sixth-graders were moved to the Madison and Hillcrest middle schools.

In 1999, Trumbull High School was on national news due to a violent hazing incident involving 10 students of the wrestling team beating, hog-tying, and sodomizing a special-needs student.
