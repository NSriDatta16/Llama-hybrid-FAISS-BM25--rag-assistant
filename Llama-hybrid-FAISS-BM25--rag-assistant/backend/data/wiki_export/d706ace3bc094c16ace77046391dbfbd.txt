As part of the Magic Carpet arms deal between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, four single-seat Hunter F.6s and two Hunter T.7s were taken from RAF stocks to be sent to Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, the single-seaters were refurbished and brought up to F.60 standards. These aircraft were to be operated by contract personnel from Commonwealth countries. All six Hunters arrived in Riyadh in May 1966. They then moved to Taif Air Base, and afterwards to Khamis Mushait Air Base, closer to the border with North Yemen. Although the Hunters were operational following attacks on Saudi Arabia by the Egyptian Air Force, they were not successful as interceptors as they lacked sufficient early warning. Instead, they were reportedly used for air strikes on targets inside North Yemen. According to Egyptian sources, two EAF Ilyushin Il-28s were shot down by Saudi Hunters near Sanaa in 1966. One single-seat aircraft crashed in 1967, and the five remaining aircraft were donated to Jordan in 1968.
