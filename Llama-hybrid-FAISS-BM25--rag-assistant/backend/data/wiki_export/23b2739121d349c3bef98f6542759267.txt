The Sorrowjoy is an album of poetry by Heather Nova, released in March 2006. The album has only been available for purchase at concerts beginning with the Intimate Evening tour, from the fan-run websites HeatherNova.Net and HeatherNova.De, and from the official website, HeatherNova.Com.

The album features Heather Nova reading 44 of the 45 poems from her book of the same name () set to ambient music arranged by Felix Tod. The only poem from the book that was not recorded on the CD is "The Wonder Is Returning".

Some of the music consists of simple sounds, such as a wind effect heard over the poem "Soon Alaska". Other music is actually taken from Heather Nova's songs, such as the music from "Sugar" that can be heard on "Six Years Behind". Most of the music is of unknown origin, probably original compositions by Felix Tod.
