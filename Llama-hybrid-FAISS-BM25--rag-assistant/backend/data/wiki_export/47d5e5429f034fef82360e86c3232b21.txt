Huttoft is a village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, about  east of the market town of Alford, on the A52 road between Ingoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea. John Betjeman, later England's Poet Laureate, visited Huttoft in the 1940s and devoted a poem to its parish church.

Etymology and early history
Huttoft is listed three times in the 1086 Domesday Book as Hotoft, in the manors of both Huttoft and Greetham in the Calcewath Hundred of the South Riding of Lindsey. The combined listings record over 19 households, and 20 villagers, 23 smallholders, 69 freemen, 20 ploughlands, and meadows of . Before the Norman Conquest Earl Harold was lord of Greetham; this in 1086 transferred to Earl Hugh of Chester who also became tenant-in-chief to King William I. The 1086 tenant-in-chief of Huttoft was Alfred of Lincoln.

Huttoft is an Anglo-Norse place-name derived from Old English hoh "decline", "slope" and Old Norse topt "site of a house". However, the Dictionary of British Place Names defines Huttoft as a "homestead on a spur of land." De Beaurepaire states that it is the same name as the Hottot; Hotot (f. e. Hotot-en-Auge) ; Hautot (former Hotot. f. e. Hautot-sur-Seine) in Normandy.
