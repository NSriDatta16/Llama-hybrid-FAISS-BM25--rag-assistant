The Hundred of Hoo Academy (formerly The Hundred of Hoo School) is a 4–18 mixed, all-through school and sixth form with academy status in Hoo St Werburgh, Kent, England. It is part of the Leigh Academies Trust.

History 
In 2007, only 22% of the school's pupils achieved five or more GCSE A* to C grades, including English and Maths. In 2008, it was one of forty schools in Kent and Medway ordered to raise this figure to the government target of 30% within three years, or face closure.

In June 2009, the school was placed into special measures following an inspection by Ofsted. This led to the resignation of its principal Tony Williams, and Gary Holden, head of Rochester Math School, became executive head of both schools. A new governing body was appointed to "handle all governance matters and provide strategic direction for the school".

In the same month, the school was earmarked £1 million to help improve its standards during the next two years, being one of seven schools nationally to be awarded funding by the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF). This followed an earlier announcement that the school had been given National Challenge School status, which at the time allowed councils to "raise standards in schools where replacement with an Academy would not be the best option".

The school became an academy on 1 September 2011, joining the Williamson Trust. It was inspected by Ofsted in 2013, which noted improvements in provision and rated it a good school.

In February 2018, the death was announced of the Trust's CEO, Gary Vyse, at the age of 37. A verdict of suicide was recorded.

Governance 
Before 2011, this was a foundation school with Kent County Council and then Medway Council.  After being put in special measures in 2009 it joined the Williamson Trust and reopened as an academy on 1 September 2011. Williamson Trust merged in January 2019 with Leigh Academies Trust. All Williamson Trust academies, including the Hundred of Hoo Academy, joined the newly named Leigh Academies Trust as part of the Medway Cluster.

Curriculum 
Virtually all maintained schools and academies follow the National Curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted on how well they succeed in delivering a 'broad and balanced curriculum'. Schools endeavour to get all students to achieve the English Baccalaureate (EBACC) qualification - this must include core subjects a modern or ancient foreign language, and either History or Geography.

The school operates a three-year, Key Stage 3 offering the 'broad and balanced curriculum'. However in 2017, the academy ran a two-year Key Stage 3 with no discrete IT, followed by a three-year Key Stage 4. This model was deprecated by Ofsted in late 2019. The trust took this on board and in September 2020 and took to offering the 3 year key stage again.
