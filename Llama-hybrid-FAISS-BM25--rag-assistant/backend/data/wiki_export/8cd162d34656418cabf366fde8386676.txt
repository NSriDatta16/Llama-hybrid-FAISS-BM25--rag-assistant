"À contre-courant" (English: "Against the current") was released on 7 October 2003. It is the seventh single by French singer Alizée. It featured the single version of the song as well as "I'm Not Twenty", the English version of "J'ai pas vingt ans". Maxi CD of the single, released on 12 November 2003, included 3 remixes and the radio edit of the single.

On the cover art, the title of the song is written partly backwards (as "courant-ertnoc A") to symbolize the meaning of the title. This caused some confusion outside France among non-francophones; for example, time to time the single was found on sale listed as "Courant-ertnoc a", which obviously means nothing.

The video was filmed on 35mm film and the length of the video is 3:54.
