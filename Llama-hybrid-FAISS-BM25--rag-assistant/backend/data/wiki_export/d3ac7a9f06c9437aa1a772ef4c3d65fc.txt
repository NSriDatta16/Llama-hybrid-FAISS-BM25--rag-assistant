Holla is a former municipality in Telemark county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1964. The area is now part of Nome Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Ulefoss. The municipality was considered part of the traditional district of Grenland, but in 1964 it became been part of the new Nome municipality which has been considered to be part of the Midt-Telemark district.

History
The parish of Hollen (later spelled Holla) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1866, an unpopulated area of Bø Municipality was transferred into Holden Muniicpality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the district of Valebø (population: 259) on the eastern side of the lake Norsjø was merged into Skien Municipality. On the same date, the rest of Holla (population: 4,093) was merged with the neighboring Lunde Municipality (population: 3,080) to form the new Nome Municipality.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Hollen farm () since the first Holla Church was built there. The first element is derived from the word  which means "sloping" or "leaning". The last element is derived from the word  which means "meadow" or "pasture". The name was spelled Holden until 1889 when the spelling was modified to Hollen. In 1918, the spelling was changed to Holla.

Churches
The Church of Norway had one parish () within the municipality of Holla. It was part of the Øvre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.
