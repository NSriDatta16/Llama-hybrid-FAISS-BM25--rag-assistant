The National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol (acronym: CAP/CC) is the highest senior official and commanding officer of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) — a non-profit corporation that is congressionally chartered to operate as the civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. The national commander also serves as the chief executive officer of CAP.

The national commander works in close collaboration with Civil Air Patrol–U.S. Air Force, a U.S. Air Force command whose commander is responsible for overseeing CAP programs, liaison between the CAP and U.S. Air Force and other United States Government agencies, and ensuring U.S. Air Force and other U.S. Government support to CAP.

History
From its creation on 1 December 1941 until 31 August 1975, the national commander of CAP was an appointed active duty commissioned officer — typically a general officer — of the United States Army Air Forces (until September 1947) or the United States Air Force (after it became an independent service in September 1947). The national commander chaired the CAP National Board.

Upon adoption of the CAP Constitution and Bylaws on 26 May 1948, the CAP was incorporated and officially became the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, the Chairman of the CAP National Board became the national commander, and the CAP National Board was redesignated as the National Executive Board (NEB), with the national commander as its chair. General Carl A. Spaatz, USAF, became the first chairman after the incorporation of the CAP after he retired from the Air Force in 1948. The board became the National Executive Committee (NEC) on 26 April 1960, with the national commander continuing as its chair.

On 1 September 1975, the position of chairman of the national board was redesignated as national commander, held by an active civilian CAP member with the CAP rank of brigadier general, with only sitting and former national commanders who served in the position on or after 1 September 1975 holding the CAP rank of brigadier general. At the same time, the former U.S. Air Force-appointed national commander position was redesignated as the executive director of the CAP. On 8 March 1995, during a reorganization of CAP National Headquarters, the title of executive director was changed to senior Air Force advisor.

On 1 December 2002, the national commander position was elevated to the rank of major general, with the national vice commander becoming a brigadier general. Current and former national commanders who held the position after 1 December 2002 are the only CAP members who hold the CAP rank of major general. Former national commanders who held the position prior to 1 December 2002 and sitting national vice commanders and those who held the position of national vice commander on or after 1 December 2002 are the only CAP members who hold the CAP rank of brigadier general.

Since 2012, the national commander of the CAP also has served as the chief executive officer of the CAP Corporation.

The current National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol is Major General Edward Phelka.
