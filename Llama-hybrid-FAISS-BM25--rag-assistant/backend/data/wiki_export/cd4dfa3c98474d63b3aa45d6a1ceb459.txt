Nude is the fourth studio album by British pop group Dead or Alive, released in Japan, December 1988 and in Europe and U.S.A. July 1989 on Epic Records. The band lost their foothold in the UK and U.S. charts with this album, but it proved to be a massive success in Japan, where the single "Turn Around and Count 2 Ten" spent 147 days at number one.  "Come Home (With Me Baby)" also topped the U.S. Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.  Much like their greatest hits package Rip It Up, the songs on Nude run together with no spaces in between to create a non-stop DJ-mix type presentation.

A companion remix album was released in Japan shortly after with the title Nude – Remade Remodelled.
