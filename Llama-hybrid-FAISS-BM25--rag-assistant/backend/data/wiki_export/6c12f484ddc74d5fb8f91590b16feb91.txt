Ernst Rudolph Georg Eckert (September 13, 1904 â€“ July 8, 2004) was an Austrian American engineer and scientist who advanced the film cooling technique for aeronautical engines. He earned his Diplom Ingenieur and doctorate in 1927 and 1931, respectively, and habilitated in 1938. Eckert worked as a jet engine scientist at the Aeronautical Research Institute in Braunschweig, Germany, then via Operation Paperclip, began jet propulsion research in 1945 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. In 1951, Eckert joined the University of Minnesota in the department of mechanical engineering. Eckert published over 550 scientific papers and books. The Eckert number in fluid dynamics was named after him.

In 1995 the National Academy of Engineering honored Eckert with its thirteenth Founders Award.

Eckert's son-in-law Horst Henning Winter, a specialist in rheology, is professor at UMass Amherst.
