History

Pereire was opened on 23 May 1910 when the line was extended from Villiers. The station is named after the Boulevard Pereire and the Place du Maréchal Juin by municipal decree of 6 April 1973. The Péreire brothers, Émile Péreire (1800–1875) and his brother Isaac (1806–1880), created the Crédit Mobilier bank in 1852. They established railroad companies in France and in Europe. Émile Péreire was the first director of the Compagnie du Chemin de fer de Paris à Saint-Germain, which opened the first railway in Paris in 1837. He was later in charge of the Auteuil railroad, which later became RER line "C". Marshal Alphonse Juin (1888–1967) was commander of the French forces in Italy in 1943 and 1944.

As part of the RATP Renouveau du métro program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 5 September 2002.

In 2018, 4,804,340 travelers entered this station which places it at the 99th position of metro stations for its frequency.
