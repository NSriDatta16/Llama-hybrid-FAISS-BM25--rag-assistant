The Sebei are a Southern Nilotic ethnic group inhabiting eastern Uganda. They speak Kupsabiny, a Kalenjin language. The Sapiiny occupy three districts, namely Bukwo, Kween and Kapchorwa.

Religion
The majority of Sabiny are Christians. According to the 2002 Census of Uganda, 40.5% of Sabiny are Anglican (Church of Uganda), 23.4% are Roman Catholic, 18.3% are Pentecostal, 9.7% are Muslim and 7% follow other religions.

Culture 
The Sebei people lead a fairly simple life style. The main structures of their lives are centered around cattle keeping, growing crops, and making beer. Common jobs held by the Sebei include cattle rearing and farming. The jobs depend on where you live. Because of their fairly laid back culture, the need for major social structure is limited. Sebei people are relatively peaceful, there are limited criminal offenses that one could do. In Sebei culture, there are two levels of criminal offense. The highest level is for murder and physical assault, the lower level is for property or major civil disputes between people or groups of people.

Locations 
The Sebei's live primarily on the slopes of Mount Elgon in eastern Uganda. They number about 300,000 people and occupy an area of 1,730.9 square km in the districts of Bukwo, Kapchorwa and Kween. Their territory borders the Republic of Kenya which is a home to more than six million Kalenjin, a large ethnic group to which the Sebei belong. The Sebei's now known mainly as Sapiny, speak Kupsabiny, a Kalenjin language spoken by other smaller groups of Kalenjin stock around Mount Elgon. The Sebei and Kenyan smaller groups (Book, Kony, Mosoop, Someek, Bongomek) inhabiting the hills of Mount Elgon are collectively referred to as the Sabaots''.In Uganda'''

The majority of the Sebei people live in the country of Uganda. The percent of the Ugandan population that is Sebei is only 0.6%; meaning that there are about 300,000 Sebei in Uganda.
