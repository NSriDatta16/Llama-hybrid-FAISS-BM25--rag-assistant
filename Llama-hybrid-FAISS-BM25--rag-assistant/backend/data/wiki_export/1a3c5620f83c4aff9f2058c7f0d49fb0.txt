It then introduces the reader to the basic agile values as written in the Agile Manifesto, and to the 6 guiding principles of agile project management. Next, the agile project management framework is broken down into five project phases and discussed in detail. Lastly, the book ends by talking about the scaling of agile project management approaches and the cultural changes required to continuously produce desired results when using agile practices. It uses a variety of examples from different industries as illustrations.
