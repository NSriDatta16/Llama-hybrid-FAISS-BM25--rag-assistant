Craveman is the twelfth studio album by American rock musician Ted Nugent, released on September 24, 2002.

The album continues the trend, started in the mid-1990s, of Nugent returning to the rawer, harder-rocking sound that made him famous in the 1970s. This stands in sharp contrast to the synth-pop of his 1980s work, and the romantic AOR power-ballads of his early 1990s band Damn Yankees. This album also contains some material from an unreleased Damn Yankees album, Bravo.

Reception
Critic Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic gave Craveman a positive 4 stars out of a possible 5, declaring it Nugent's "fiercest effort in decades, and certainly his heaviest ever."
