Bring On the Night is the first live album by Sting recorded over the course of several live shows in 1985 and released in 1986. The title is taken from a song by the Police from their 1979 album Reggatta de Blanc. The songs performed include Sting's early solo material from the studio album The Dream of the Blue Turtles, and from his time with The Police, with a few of the performances played as medleys of the two. The touring band features the prominent jazz musicians Branford Marsalis on saxophone and clarinet, Darryl Jones on bass guitar, Kenny Kirkland on keyboards and synthesizer, and  Omar Hakim on drums. Also appearing are backing vocalists Janice Pendarvis and Dolette McDonald.

Despite not featuring any hit singles, the album reached number 16 on the UK Album Charts and won Sting a Grammy Award in 1988 for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male.

Bring On the Night is also a 1985 documentary directed by Michael Apted covering the formative stages of Sting's solo career—released as DVD in 2005.
