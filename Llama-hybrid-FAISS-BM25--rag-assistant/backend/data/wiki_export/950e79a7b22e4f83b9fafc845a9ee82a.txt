In mathematics, in the area of complex analysis, Carlson's theorem is a uniqueness theorem which was discovered by Fritz David Carlson. Informally, it states that two different analytic functions which do not grow very fast at infinity can not coincide at the integers. The theorem may be obtained from the Phragmén–Lindelöf theorem, which is itself an extension of the maximum-modulus theorem.

Carlson's theorem is typically invoked to defend the uniqueness of a Newton series expansion. Carlson's theorem has generalized analogues for other expansions.

Statement

Assume that  satisfies the following three conditions. The first two conditions bound the growth of  at infinity, whereas the third one states that  vanishes on the non-negative integers.

  is an entire function of exponential type, meaning that  for some real values , .
 There exists  such that 
  for every non-negative integer .

Then  is identically zero.

Sharpness

First condition

The first condition may be relaxed: it is enough to assume that  is analytic in , continuous in , and satisfies

for some real values , .

Second condition

To see that the second condition is sharp, consider the function . It vanishes on the integers; however, it grows exponentially on the imaginary axis with a growth rate of , and indeed it is not identically zero.

Third condition
A result, due to , relaxes the condition that  vanish on the integers. Namely, Rubel showed that the conclusion of the theorem remains valid if  vanishes on a subset  of upper density 1, meaning that

This condition is sharp, meaning that the theorem fails for sets  of upper density smaller than 1.

Applications
Suppose  is a function that possesses all finite forward differences .  Consider then the Newton series

with  is the binomial coefficient and  is the -th forward difference.  By construction, one then has that  for all non-negative integers , so that the difference .  This is one of the conditions of Carlson's theorem; if  obeys the others,  then  is identically zero, and the finite differences for  uniquely determine its Newton series.  That is, if a Newton series for  exists, and the difference satisfies the Carlson conditions, then  is unique.
