Personal life 

In May 2011, Nunes gave birth to her first child, a son named Antonio Kamakanaalohamaikalani Harvey Sabàto, with Italian American model and actor Antonio Sabàto Jr. The couple met in Hawaii during the filming of the VH1 reality TV show, My Antonio. Sabàto has two children, son Jack and daughter Mina, from previous relationships. Their son was named for his father while his middle name, an uncommon name of Hawaiian origin meaning "the beloved gift from the Heavens," was given in honor of Nunes' Native Hawaiian heritage. Nunes and Sabàto married in Hawaii on 25 September 2012 and Sabàto filed for divorce on 20 December 2016, citing irreconcilable differences. Nunes alleged that Sabàto revealed to her that he'd been struggling with prescription drug abuse following a car accident and that, in the past, he was addicted to crystal meth.
