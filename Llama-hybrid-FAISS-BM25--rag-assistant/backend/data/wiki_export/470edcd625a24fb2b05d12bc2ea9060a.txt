The Fr8Auctions 208 is a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race held at Atlanta Motor Speedway. It was initially held from 2004 until 2012 and taken off the schedule in 2013. The race returned to the schedule in 2015 and since then has been held on the Saturday of the race weekend as a doubleheader with the track's NASCAR Xfinity Series race, the Nalley Cars 250, prior to the NASCAR Cup Series' Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 race at the track on Sunday.

History

In 2016, Great Clips became the title sponsor of the race.

In 2020, series title sponsor Camping World sponsored the race along with the Veteran Tickets Foundation (Vet Tix), which is an organization that gives out tickets to sporting events to members of the U.S. Armed Forces.

Fr8 (pronounced "freight") Auctions became the title sponsor of the race in 2021. Stages 1 and 2 were both 30 laps long and the final stage was 70 laps long. They returned as the title sponsor in 2022 when the race was lengthened by 8 miles. Therefore, the name of the race became the Fr8 Auctions 208.
