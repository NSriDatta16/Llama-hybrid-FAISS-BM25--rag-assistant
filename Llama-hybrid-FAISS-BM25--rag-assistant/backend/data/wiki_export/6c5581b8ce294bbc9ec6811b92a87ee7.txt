The stadium was opened on August 26, 1952. In the first years the field surface was dirt. This changed when Club de Deportes La Serena became professional in 1955 and grass was planted. Since its inauguration, the La Serena combined team played there. In the beginning, demountable grandstands were added to increase the stadium capacity.
