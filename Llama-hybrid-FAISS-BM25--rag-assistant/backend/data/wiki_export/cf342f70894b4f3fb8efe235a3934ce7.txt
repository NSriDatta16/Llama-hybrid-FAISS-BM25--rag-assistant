St Birinus School, previously known as Didcot Boy's County Modern and Didcot Senior Boys,  is a boys' academy in Didcot, Oxfordshire, England. St Birinus was founded in 1936 as a secondary modern before becoming a comprehensive in 1973. In September 2012 the school became an academy with the same name. St Birinus' key catchment area includes the town of Didcot and the surrounding rural area, from Harwell in the west to South Moreton in the east and from Long Wittenham in the north to Chilton in the south, however the school also caters for parents in other parts of Oxfordshire who wish their children to be educated in a single-sex environment. As of September 2019 the headteacher is Will Manning. The school is a dual specialist technology college and language college.

The school takes boys from the age of 11 until the end of their GCSEs at the age of 16. After this students may continue to the associated Didcot Sixth Form College for their A-levels. This mixed sixth form is shared with Didcot Girls' School and geographically spread across both school sites. As of January 2015 the most recent OFSTED inspection was in 2012 (prior to the school becoming an academy) and the school was given an overall rating of 'good'.

History
In 1931 St Frideswide's School opened in Didcot as a coeducational secondary modern school. Then, in 1936, the Didcot Boy's County Modern school was opened in the town, enabling single sex education and, in 1951, the school acquired its present name: St Birinus School. The school is named for Birinus, the first Bishop of Dorchester, although the school is secular. In 1973 the school became a comprehensive school and in 1997 gained specialist technology college status. In 2006 the school became one of the first in Oxfordshire to acquire a second specialism: languages. In September 2012 the running of the school was transferred to a limited company, of the same name, when the school became an academy. In 2011 St Birinus announced its intention, in conjunction with Didcot Girls' School and Abingdon and Witney College, to bid to run a new academy school in the town, however their bid was not shortlisted by Oxfordshire County Council.

In 2006, the school celebrated its 70th Anniversary.

Campus
The school is primarily based around its Mereland Road site, however it has additional off-site sports facilities at the nearby Hagbourne Triangle. In recent years the school has updated many of their facilities including the science centre, mathematics block and humanities centre. The new Science Centre was constructed on the site of the old Greenmere Primary School, now relocated a short distance away.

The school shares its site with Didcot Leisure Centre and, thus, has access to additional sports and assembly facilities. Students at Didcot Sixth Form College also have access to facilities at Didcot Girls' School.

Curriculum

As an academy St Birinus is required to follow the national curriculum in English, maths and science; however it has considerable freedom over the remaining aspects of its curriculum. At key stage 3 the school broadly follows the national curriculum. At key stage 4 the school offers a full range of "core" GCSEs, as well as further optional GCSEs and vocational qualifications such as BTECs. Through a partnership with Oxford University the school is able to offer Latin lessons to its GCSE pupils.

The school has made several attempts to integrate new technologies with teaching and learning, and, in 2006, received an excellence award from RM plc in recognition of this.

Extracurricular activities

The school operates a house system and has 4 houses: Athenian, Corinthian, Spartan and Trojan. The houses compete in a variety of competitions and the house that is awarded the most points in an academic year is awarded the house cup for that year.

St Birinus has partnered with a number of charitable organisations over the years. For instance St Birinus School raised almost £11,000 for the Oxford Children's Hospital, in efforts spearheaded by former pupil Andrew Baker. As a result of being a major supporter for the Children's Hospital, St Birinus School has been recognised for its contribution, having its name engraved with Andrew Baker on a plaque of recognition which sits inside the children's hospital atrium.

Events to celebrate the school's 70th milestone included a whole school sponsored walk which raised £11,461 for the Oxford Children's Hospital Appeal and its link school in The Gambia, West Africa.
