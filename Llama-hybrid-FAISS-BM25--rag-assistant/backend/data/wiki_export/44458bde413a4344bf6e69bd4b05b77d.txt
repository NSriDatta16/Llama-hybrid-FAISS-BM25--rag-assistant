Tent pegging (sometimes spelled tent-pegging or tentpegging) is a cavalry sport of ancient origin, and is one of only ten equestrian disciplines officially recognised by the International Equestrian Federation. Used narrowly, the term refers to a specific mounted game with ground targets. More broadly, it refers to the entire class of mounted cavalry games involving pointed and edged weapons (lance and sword) on horseback, for which the term "equestrian skill-at-arms" is also used.

Origin
Cavaliers have practised the specific game of tent pegging since at least the 4th century BC. Eurasian empires spread the game around the world. As a result, the game's date and location of origin are ambiguous.

In all accounts, the competitive sport evolved out of cavalry training exercises designed to develop cavaliers' prowess with the sword and lance from horseback. However, whether tent pegging developed cavaliers' generic skills or prepared them for specific combat situations is unclear.

According to the International Equestrian Federation, "most equestrian authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in the Indian subcontinent during the middle ages in the battlefields as a tactics used by the horsed cavalry against elephant mounted troops" A cavalier able to precisely stab the highly sensitive flesh behind an elephant's toenail would cause the enemy elephant to rear, unseat his mahout, and possibly run amok, breaking ranks and trampling infantry.
The term "tent pegging" is certainly related to the idea that cavalry mounting a surprise pre-dawn raid on an enemy camp could use the tent-pegging skills to sever or uproot tent pegs, collapsing the tents on their sleeping occupants and sowing havoc and terror in the camp.  However, there are few reliable accounts of a cavalry squadron ever employing such tactics.

Because the specific game of tent-pegging is the most popular equestrian skill-at-arms game, the entire class of sports became known as tent-pegging during the twilight of cavalry in the twentieth century.

Essential rules
The specific game of tent pegging has a mounted horseman riding at a gallop and using a sword or a lance to pierce, pick up, and carry away a small ground target (a symbolic tent peg) or a series of small ground targets.

The broader class of tent pegging games also includes ring jousting (in which a galloping rider tries to pass the point of his weapon through a suspended ring); lemon sticking (in which the rider tries to stab or slice a lemon suspended from a cord or sitting on a platform); quintain tilting (in which the rider charges a mannequin mounted on a swivelling or rocking pedestal); and mounted archery.

A given tent pegging competition's rules specify the size and composition of the target; the number of consecutive targets placed on a course; the dimensions and weight of the sword and lance; the minimum time in which a course must be covered; and the extent to which a target must be struck, cut, or carried.

Contemporary sport
Today, tent pegging is practised around the world but is especially popular in Australia, India, Israel, Oman, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The Olympic Council of Asia included tent pegging as an official sport in 1982, and the International Federation for Equestrian Sports recognised it as an official equestrian discipline in 2004.

New and emerging national tent pegging associations have helped spread the sport's popularity.  The Australian Royal Adelaide Show, the British Tent Pegging Association, and the United States Cavalry Association now hold annual national championships and demonstrations in their respective countries.

The United States Tent Pegging Association (USTPA) is aÂ not-for-profit organization registered in the New York state and is the National Governing Body for the sport of tent pegging in the US.
