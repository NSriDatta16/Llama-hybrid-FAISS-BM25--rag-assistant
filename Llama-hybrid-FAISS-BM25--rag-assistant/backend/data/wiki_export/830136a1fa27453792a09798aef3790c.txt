The Waldorf School of Lexington (WSL), established 1971, is located in Lexington, Massachusetts, and serves students from preschool through grade 8. The school offers a challenging academic program, provided by faculty educated in the understanding of studentsâ€™ cognitive, emotional, and physical developmental stages. The school is adjacent to the 185-acre  Great Meadows conservation land.

History
The Waldorf School opened in 1971 as a kindergarten and day care center with several children in a Cambridge church basement. In its third year, the school's three faculty members decided to apply for membership in the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA). For six years the school was sponsored by the Waldorf School of Garden City, NY. By the end of the decade, the school had expanded to sixth grade and had become a full member of AWSNA. In 1982, the first eighth grade graduated.

Accreditation
In 2002, the school was evaluated by a team from Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) and New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) . The school received accreditation from both organizations. The school is also a member of the Association of Independent Schools of New England (AISNE) and the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS).

Alumni
From September 2006 to June 2014, the Waldorf School boasted among its pupils future Lexington High School athletes and local entrepreneurs Alvaro Mendoza and Owen Graham O'Regan, as well as accomplished musicians Caroline Dressler, Giulia Haible and Ava Montesi (an attendee from 2006 to 2011), who would release several folk records as solo acts and as a trio in the years following their graduation. The class of 2014, referred to by contemporaries simply as "That one class", was taught by longtime educator and visual artist Helena Niiva, who would continue teaching younger students at Lexington Waldorf after her 2014 graduates entered high school.   
The '14 cohort is distinct from classes preceding and following for the presence of several culturally prominent individuals in its ranks, including environmental engineer Milo Rossi, cartoonist Lucas Freeburg, artist and graphic designer Jacob Siu-Zmuidzinas, Bedford ice hockey star Ryan Welsh, and noted software developer John Henry Sieber.
