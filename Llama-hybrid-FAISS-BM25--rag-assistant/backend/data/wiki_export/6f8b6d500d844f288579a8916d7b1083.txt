James Peppler Morris  (born 10 January 1947) is an American bass-baritone opera singer. He is known for his interpretation of the role of Wotan in Richard Wagner's operatic cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen. The Metropolitan Opera video recording of the complete cycle with Morris as Wotan has been described as an "exceptional issue on every count."  It was broadcast on PBS in 1990, to the largest viewing audience of the Ring Cycle in human history.

James Morris was born in Baltimore, Maryland, where he studied voice with Rosa Ponselle and at the Peabody Conservatory. He attended the University of Maryland and also studied at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He made his debut with the Baltimore Opera in 1967, as "Crespel" in Jacques Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, which starred Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle.

He first appeared in New York City at the Metropolitan Opera, in January 1971, as The King in Verdi's Aïda. He went on to perform a repertoire ranging from Mozart through Verdi and Wagner to Benjamin Britten.

In January 2008, he reprised the role of Wotan in a production of Die Walküre at the Metropolitan Opera, the theater with which he is most closely associated. In 2009, alongside Deborah Voigt, he also returned there to sing "Scarpia" in Puccini's Tosca.

His interpretations can be heard on a number of recordings. He lives in Warren Township, New Jersey with his wife, mezzo-soprano Susan Quittmeyer, and their twins, Jennifer and Daniel. He also has a daughter, Heather.

As of August 2015, Morris is a faculty member at the Manhattan School of Music.
