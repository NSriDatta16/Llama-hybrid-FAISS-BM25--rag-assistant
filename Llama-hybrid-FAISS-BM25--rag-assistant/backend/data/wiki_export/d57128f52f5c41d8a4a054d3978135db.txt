History 

Opened by the North British Railway on 15 May 1882, at one time the station had five platforms: two as an island platform on the West Highland Line - sometimes called Craigendoran Upper (closed in 1964 and subsequently demolished), one on Craigendoran Pier serving Clyde Steamers (closed in 1972 and lifted) and two on the line to Helensburgh (one closed when the line was singled). All five platforms, bar those for the West Highland Line, were electrified. There were once goods sidings located in here, built in the 1940s, but these were removed in 1964 with the end of regular local freight workings.

The track layout at Craigendoran Junction was simplified in 1984 under the auspices of British Rail, singling the line to Helensburgh Central. The present layout at the junction, just east of the station, consists of a loop (available to West Highland Line trains only) and single lines to  and .  The line south of here towards  remains double track.
