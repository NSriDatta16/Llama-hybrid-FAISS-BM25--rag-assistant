The eponymous debut album by American nu metal band Motograter was released on June 24, 2003. Although the album has a total of 22 tracks, half of them are short, static tracks, which are all the names of the tracks reversed. For instance, "Eman On" is a reversed version of "No Name", and a message can clearly be heard in the last five seconds. This is the band's only release to feature Ivan Moody as lead vocalist as well as all other band members with the exception of Matt Nunes.
