Hosting 

Eden Park in Auckland Park was the first stadium to host the Rugby World Cup Final twice, with the 1987 and 2011 finals having been held there. Twickenham Stadium also hosted the final twice in 1991 and 2015.
The record for the city that has been a part of most Rugby World Cups is currently four and is held by Cardiff that hosted matches in 1991, 1999, 2007 and 2015. If the definition of "city" includes its metropolitan area, Paris has also hosted matches in four tournaments. The city of Paris hosted matches in 1991, its adjacent suburb of Saint-Denis hosted matches in 1999 and 2023, and both cities hosted matches in 2007. Edinburgh and Toulouse hosted matches in three tournaments.

Head-to-Head 

The highest number of Head-to-Head matches between two nations currently stands at eight meetings, encompassing four teams (Australia, France, New Zealand, and Wales) in two Rugby World Cup rivalries. On the other end of the table, there are currently 70 Head-to-Head meetings involving one game between two nations. The following table lists the Head-to-Head statistics of the Rugby World Cup, ranging from the inaugural tournament in 1987 to the latest tournament in 2023 (as of 22 October). It is organised first numerically, with the more Head-to-Head meetings appearing at the top of the table and the fewer meetings, such as one meeting between two nations appearing at the bottom of the table, and second, alphabetically by teams.

Tier 1 Nations Head-to-Head 

The table below shows the current dominance in the Head-to-Head meetings of Tier 1 nations at the Rugby World Cup from the first tournament in 1987 to the latest tournament in 2023 (as of 20 October). Currently, New Zealand has the best record amongst the other Tier 1 nations, achieving more wins and culminating in a superior Head-to-Head record over seven other Tier 1 nations, and equal with two others (Australia and South Africa). Italy is at the bottom of the table, and has an inferior Head-to-Head record with eight other Tier 1 nations, and parity with one other nation (Argentina). There are two Tier 1 Head-to-Head meetings that have never been played at a Rugby World Cup: England versus Ireland, and Scotland versus Wales.

Trivia 
England became the first sole host nation to be eliminated in the pool stage of a Rugby World Cup in 2015. Wales, as joint hosts, were eliminated in the pool stage in 1991.
Four match-ups have occurred twice in the same World Cup:
2007 Argentina defeated France in the opening match 17–12, and went on to beat them 34–10 in the bronze final. 
2007 South Africa defeated England 36–0 in the pool stage, and went on to play them in the final, winning 15–6. 
2011 New Zealand defeated France 37–17 in the pool stage, and went on to play them in the final, winning 8–7.
2023 England defeated Argentina 27–10 in the pool stage, and went on to beat them 26–23 in the bronze final.
There are two Tier 1 Head-to-Head meetings that have never been played at a Rugby World Cup: England versus Ireland, and Scotland versus Wales.
Four nations have reached a Rugby World Cup Final having previously lost a game in that tournament: England in 1991 and 2007, South Africa in 2019 and 2023, New Zealand in 2023 and France in 2011, the latter being the only team to reach the final having lost two games. The 2023 final is the only one with both teams having previously lost a game in the tournament.
New Zealand have been involved in four World Cup opening matches, the most by any other team. The All Blacks defeated Italy in 1987, England in 1991, and Tonga in 2011, but lost to France in 2023. Argentina have participated in three World Cup opening matches. The Pumas participated in the first three World Cup openers of the professional era – losing to Wales and Australia in 1999 and 2003 respectively, and defeating France in 2007.
France and New Zealand are the only nations to have made it to at least the quarter-finals of every Rugby World Cup. Furthermore, South Africa have also done so since they started participating in 1995.
France is the only non English-speaking country to have made it to a Rugby World Cup final – in 1987, 1999 and 2011. It is also the only country to reach a final without ever winning it.
The only Tier 2 country to have participated in every Rugby World Cup is Japan, with Canada only failing to qualify for the first time in 2023, making it to one quarter-final in 1991 and Japan reaching the quarter finals in 2019. 
Japan is the only team to have ever won three matches in a tournament where they did not progress beyond the pool stage, losing out to South Africa and Scotland in their pool by points difference in 2015.
Among the Tier 1 nations, Italy is the only one not to have made it to at least the quarter-finals in any Rugby World Cup. Conversely, four Tier 2 countries have made it to the quarter-finals – Fiji in 1987, 2007 and 2023, Samoa (then called Western Samoa) in 1991 and 1995, Canada in 1991 and Japan in 2019. 
Arguably, Argentina in 1999 can also be regarded as having been a Tier 2 nation at the time, since they were not yet in the southern-hemisphere Rugby Championship: although official "Tiers" were not recognised at the time, this match can be regarded as the start of their actual period of achievement which led to them later earning recognition at the top table. Similarly, Japan's achievements in 2019, added to their defeat of South Africa in 2015, was eventually recognised by formally admitting them to the definition of a Tier 1 nation in May 2023.
The 2015 final between Australia and New Zealand is the highest scoring Rugby World Cup final ever, with New Zealand winning that match 34–17.
After the 2015 final, New Zealand became the first team to win the Rugby World Cup three times, and the first team to have successfully defended its title. South Africa became the second team to defend its title in 2023 and the first to win the Rugby Word Cup on four occasions as well as the first to win successive titles away from home.
Wales have had the most upsets in the Rugby World Cup, having lost to Samoa both in 1991 and 1999, then losing to Fiji in 2007. Other major upsets include Ireland and Scotland losing to Japan in 2019, France losing to Tonga in 2011, South Africa losing to Japan in 2015 and Australia losing to Fiji in 2023. Argentina's defeat of Ireland in 1999 was also regarded as an upset at the time.
South Africa became the first nation to win a World Cup after losing a match in the pool stage in 2019 and did so again in 2023.
New Zealand were the last Tier 1 team to experience defeat in the pool stages of a Rugby World Cup. They were defeated by France in 2023.
