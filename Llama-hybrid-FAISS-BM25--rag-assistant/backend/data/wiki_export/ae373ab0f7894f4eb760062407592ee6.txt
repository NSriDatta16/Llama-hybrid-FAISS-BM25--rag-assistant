He moved to Lahore to attend the Punjab University to further study English literature.

Political activism and military service
Due to his long attraction to the work of Charles Dickens, Suleri earned the nickname of "Pip" from his family and friends. He moved to Karachi after becoming politically aligned with the Muslim League, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. In support of the Pakistan Movement, he penned many political columns and opinions in the Orient Press as well as the British Evening Times.

Suleri also authored and published "The Road to Peace and Pakistan" in 1944, and My Leader in 1945; all of which greatly exhorted the political objectives of the Pakistan Movement and the independence from the British India of the British Empire. In 1946, he departed for the United Kingdom but returned to Pakistan after the partition by the United Kingdom. Immediately after his return, he was appointed assistant editor of the English language newspaper, the Dawn. He left Dawn when the Pakistan Times was started in 1947, and took an assignment as its correspondent in London. For sometime, he remained associated with the Pakistan Army and briefly served in Inter-Services Public Relations, which he eventually becoming its director-general and achieved the rank of colonel in 1965.

Career in journalism and ministry

Subsequently, he was removed by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto from the Pakistan Times and was thrown in jail after penning an article against socialism.

After an inquiry launched by the FIA, Suleri was picked up on charges of sedition at the behest of FIA director M.A. Gurmani, and his case was tried in the Central Jail in Punjab. After the imposition of martial law in 1977, chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq released him from prison and ultimately appointed him for a stint as editor-in-chief of the Pakistan Times. His political ideas further pushed him to be close with the military government whereas he briefly served as additional secretary of the Ministry of Information and Mass-media Broadcasting.
