The Henry Ford Health System 200 was a NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series race that took place at Michigan International Speedway. The event was started in 1999 and was won by Greg Biffle. In 2001 Michigan did not hold a Truck race because of date conflicts with the CART event which it had been associated. The 2004 race marked the first win for Toyota in a national NASCAR series when Travis Kvapil won for Bang! Racing. The race was removed from the 2021 schedule.
