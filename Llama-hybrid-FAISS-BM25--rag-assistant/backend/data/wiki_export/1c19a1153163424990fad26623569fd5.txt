Dennis Vitolo (born December 18, 1956) is an American former race driver who competed in the CART series.  He raced in the 1988 and 1991-1999 seasons with 36 career starts, including the 1994 Indianapolis 500. He was involved in a crash in that race, taking out reigning CART champion Nigel Mansell in an incident that occurred under caution. The field had slowed and Vitolo ran into the rear of Mansell's car on the warm-up lane between turns 1 and 2. He also raced in the 1997 Indianapolis 500, which by then had become part of the Indy Racing League. His best career CART finish was 7th, in the U.S. 500 at Michigan International Speedway. Vitolo also mentored NASCAR Driver Mike Senica as the two met back in 1994 after the Indianapolis 500.
