Deep Tracks is a Sirius XM Radio channel featuring lesser-known classic rock music selections such as album tracks, one-hit wonders, concert recordings, "forgotten 45s" and "B-side" tracks.

Brian Beddow is Deep Tracks' current programming director. Earle Bailey is one of its on-air voices and has worked with American voice-over artist Ted Williams. Meg Griffin and Jim Ladd (with his themed sets programming) are also heard regularly on the channel during the week, with Carol Miller appearing on weekends. 

The station appears on SiriusXM Radio as channel 27. 
Originally it replaced The Vault as a part of the Sirius/XM merger in 2008. It can also be heard on Dish Network channel 6027(previously 6016) until Sirius XM's The Blend took Sirius XM Radio 16 and Dish Network 6016. As of April 2009, this channel has changed its logo, taking the logo from former XM channel Top Tracks, which was replaced by Classic Vinyl post-Sirius/XM merger.

The name is a remnant of XM's old classic rock stations: Big Tracks, Top Tracks, and Deep Tracks. Big Tracks became Classic Rewind. Top Tracks became Classic Vinyl.

The original programmer for the channel, George Taylor Morris, departed in the summer of 2008 due to health issues.

For one week in January 2020, the station exclusively played music by Rush in tribute to the band's drummer Neil Peart, who died on January 7, 2020.

On October 6, 2020, the station started playing music by Van Halen in tribute to Eddie Van Halen, who died on the same day. The first song played was "Jamie's Cryin'".

Dusty Street was the host for some time; she died in 2023.
