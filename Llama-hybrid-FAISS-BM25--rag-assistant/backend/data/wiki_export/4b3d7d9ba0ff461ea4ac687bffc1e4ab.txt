Scores: Songs from "Copacabana" and "Harmony" is Barry Manilow's third album with Concord Records. It features selections from two musicals that feature original music by Manilow and lyrics by Bruce Sussman.

The first half of the record features songs from Copacabana: The Musical. "Dancin' Fool", "Sweet Heaven", and "Copacabana", which had been previously recorded and released, were re-recorded. "Who Needs To Dream" is a previously released song which was included on the soundtrack to the television version of Copacabana which starred Barry Manilow. And "This Can’t Be Real" is duet with Olivia Newton-John.

The second half of the album features songs from the Harmony: A New Musical based on a true story about the German singing group the Comedian Harmonists. The musical, with music by Manilow and book and lyrics by Sussman,  had its world premier at the La Jolla Playhouse and subsequent productions at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta and the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. Its New York premier was in March 2022 at National Yiddish Theatre Folksbiene. In April 2023 it was announced that the show will open on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in October 2023.
