In Rataj's taxonomy Echinodorus ovalis is in Section Cordifolii, Subgenus Echinodorus.
It is related to Echinodorus cordifolius and listed by some authorities and importers as a synonym of that species, e.g. E. cordifolius 'ovalis'.

Description

Leaves 40 – 50 cm long, blades ovate or oval, at the tip blunt, at the base decurrent or abrupt, 7.5 – 19 cm long x 3 – 10 cm wide, trimmed with very distinct pellucid lines.

Stem prostrate, 80 – 90 cm long, proliferous. Inflorescence racemose, having 4 - (6) whorls. Bracts shorter than pedicels, 0.8 - 1.5 cm long, shallowly connate, pedicels about 4.5 cm long. Sepals with smooth ribs quite unlike the muricate (warty) ribs of the similar E. cordifolius. Achenes probably with 3 facial glands.

Most specimens seem to have few flowers.
