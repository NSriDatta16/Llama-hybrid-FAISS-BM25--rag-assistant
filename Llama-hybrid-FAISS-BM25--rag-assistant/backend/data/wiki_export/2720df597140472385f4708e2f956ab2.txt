He is the author of books related to number one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and other books related to various music charts as well.

Early life
Born to Irving and Mildred Bronson and raised in Culver City, California. At age five, he was selected to portray actor/writer/producer Jack Webb as a child in a series of photographs in the May 1954 issue of Cosmopolitan. Bronson showed an early aptitude for gauging the popularity of artists and songs. At age eleven, Bronson won a contest in the Los Angeles Mirror-News requiring him to select favorites in several music categories. His prize was a lunch with actress Connie Stevens. As Bronson later wrote, "I realized that keeping track of records and artists wasn't such a bad idea."

One of Bronson's earliest published works was in the first letters column of The Amazing Spider-Man, in issue 3, published in 1962. A follow-up letter was printed in The Amazing Spider-Man No. 608, published 47 years later. His letters were also published on a regular basis in issues of Superman, Action Comics, Adventure Comics, The Flash and other DC Comics publications.

Career
From 1971 to 1982, he was a publicist for NBC-TV in Burbank, California. Bronson handled publicity for a number of TV series, including Sanford and Son, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, B. J. and the Bear, Man from Atlantis, The Bionic Woman, Police Story, Police Woman, Bonanza, Quark, Joe & Valerie, Voyagers!, The Powers of Matthew Star, Hollywood Squares, The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder, and the Bob Hope specials.

Bronson's regular Chart Beat column appeared weekly in Billboard magazine from January 1993, when he took over from Paul Grein who originated the column in March 1981, until April 2005, when it was transferred completely to Billboard.com. The online Chart Beat Chat column appeared at Billboard.com from April 1996 until March 5, 2009.
