Critical

Music website AllMusic awarded the album two out of five stars. Writer Darren Ratner noted that "the diehard wrestling fanatic will certainly appreciate it," but proposed that the tracks are more well suited to remaining as entrance themes on television. Ratner praised "The Game" and "I've Got It All", but criticised the original song "Pie". Alex Ristic of Slam! Wrestling also praised Triple H's entrance theme and criticised "Pie", but criticised the album for its inclusion of older material and concluded that "even a long time fan might not find enough enticing material." A review by Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald described the album as "truly, truly brutal."
