Mark William Bryan (born May 6, 1967) is an American musician. He is a founding member, songwriter, and lead guitarist for the band Hootie & the Blowfish. In 1986, Bryan and his friend Darius Rucker formed a duo called the Wolf Brothers while attending the University of South Carolina. Eventually, friends Dean Felber and Jim Sonefeld joined the band, which led to the founding of Hootie & the Blowfish in 1989. Bryan has also released three solo albums: 30 on the Rail, End of the Front, and Songs of the Fortnight.

Early life and career
Bryan was born in Silver Spring, Maryland. He attended Seneca Valley High School in Germantown, Maryland, and received his bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of South Carolina in 1989. While attending the university, he collaborated with Darius Rucker to create an acoustic duo band called The Wolf Brothers. From there they grew to form a new band named Hootie & the Blowfish with friends Dean Felber and Jim Sonefeld.

Hootie & the Blowfish
Hootie and the Blowfish is an American rock band formed at the University of South Carolina by Darius Rucker, Dean Felber, Jim Sonefeld, and Mark Bryan in 1989. As of July 2010, the band had charted sixteen singles on various Billboard singles charts and recorded five studio albums; and their 1994 debut album, Cracked Rear View, was the 16th-best-selling album of all time in the U.S., having been certified platinum 16 times. They have sold over 21 million albums in the United States alone. Cracked Rear View went on to earn the Billboard's Band of the Year Award in 1996 and the RIAA's Diamond Award for sales of 10 million units. Cracked Rear View remains the 12th best selling album in music business history, and all albums combined have moved over 25 million worldwide.

The band has since gone their separate ways, however Hootie & the Blowfish still perform together numerous times each year. Bryan is a consistent participant in the Hootie & the Blowfish Monday After the Masters Celebrity Pro-Am Golf Tournament. All proceeds from this tournament go to the Hootie & the Blowfish Foundation which makes donations to education and junior golf charities. Hootie & the Blowfish also holds Hootie HomeGrown, an annual event in which they perform a concert to benefit area schools.

Solo career
Since moving to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1999, Bryan has produced full-length albums, as well as co-written and produced songs for other artists. He was also involved in founding the College of Charleston Radio Station, and is helping to develop a music industry concentration there.

In 2001, Bryan founded Carolina Studios, a local nonprofit after school music recording and technology program that helps children ages 8â€“18 thrive in music and the arts. Bryan became a chairman on the board of Carolina Studios in 2007.

In 2012, Bryan partnered with NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin to create Pro-Am Jam, a yearly  golf event for the Denny Hamlin Foundation, Carolina Studios, and Student Transportation of America Education Foundation.

In 2009, Mark created Chucktown Music Group, partnering with long-time friend Ashley Flowers in 2014. Chucktown Music Group offers services to local artists including music licensing, promotion, marketing and industry connection.
