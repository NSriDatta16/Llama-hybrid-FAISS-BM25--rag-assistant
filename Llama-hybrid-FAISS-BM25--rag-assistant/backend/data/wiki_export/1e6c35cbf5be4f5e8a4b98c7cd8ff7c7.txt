Noerine Kaleeba is a Ugandan physiotherapist, educator and AIDS activist. She is the co-founder of the AIDS activism group "The AIDS Support Organization" (TASO). She is currently a program development adviser for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). She is also the Patron of TASO.

Background
Noerine Kaleeba specialised in orthopaedics, physiotherapy and community rehabilitation at Makerere University in Kampala, and the Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic & District Hospital in Oswestry, England. She has worked as a physiotherapist at Mulago Hospital, and was the principal of Mulago School of Physiotherapy until 1987.

TASO 
In June 1986, Kaleeba received a call that her husband, Christopher, had become very sick while he was in England working on his masters in sociology and political science. He was diagnosed with AIDS. He died in January 1987, which caused Kaleeba to co-found a support group that same year, The AIDS Support Organization (TASO). The goal of the organization was to help provide support to people who have been diagnosed with AIDS and their loved ones. The organization provides families of those who are infected with information about the disease and ways to provide care, without becoming infected with the disease as well. The organization also offers care, support and counseling, as well as to mobilize communities and neighborhood care for people with HIV/AIDS and their families. Based on the concept of "positive living", TASO was one of the first community responses to AIDS in Africa and is today one of the leading examples in AIDS care and support and community education for prevention in resource-limited settings. Kaleeba worked as the executive director of TASO Uganda for eight years until 1995 when she retired, and was elected Patron of the TASO movement.

Current 
Kaleeba still holds the position of Patron of the TASO movement. She also currently works as a program development adviser, Africa, for the "Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS" (UNAIDS). Since January 1996, she remains based at their secretariat in Geneva.
