Beverly Regional Airport  is a city-owned, public-use airport located in Beverly, Danvers and Wenham, Massachusetts, in Essex County, three nautical miles (6 km) northwest of Beverly's central business district.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a reliever airport, which means it is available to relieve Logan International Airport of small general aviation type aircraft during Logan's peak traffic times.

History 
Beverly Regional Airport was built in 1928 through the efforts of the Beverly Aero Club and the Beverly Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Navy operated the airport during World War II under a joint-use agreement as Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Beverly. It existed as an auxiliary air facility of Naval Air Station Squantum.

It was commissioned on 15 May 1943 and the airfield was upgraded with a new asphalt runway. The Navy built a control tower, a barracks, and other structures and consisted of four officers and sixty enlisted men. The field provided touch and go practice for students at Naval Air Station Squantum as well as Fleet Air Arm student pilots. Planes from Coast Guard Air Station Salem also used the facility for maritime patrol, as well as a detachment from VS-31, which flew anti-submarine patrols with Douglas SBD-5 aircraft.

It was decommissioned as a military facility on August 1, 1945. Ownership of the airport was transferred back to the City of Beverly in 1950.

As Costales got out of his aircraft and walked toward the other aircraft, he was struck by his aircraft's propeller and killed instantly. The student pilot in the PiperSport aircraft declared an emergency with the Control Tower, who then called 911. The airport was subsequently shut down for several hours as an investigation was conducted.
