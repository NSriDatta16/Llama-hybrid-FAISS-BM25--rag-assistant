Permian tetrapods were amphibians and reptiles that lived during the Permian Period.

During this time, amphibians remained common, including various Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli.  Synapsids became the dominant type of animal, represented by the Pelycosaurs during the Early Permian and Therapsids during the Middle and Late Permian, and distinguished by the appearance and possession of mammal-like characteristics (hence the old term "mammal-like reptiles").  These were accompanied by Anapsids or Parareptiles, which included both lizard-like and large herbivorous forms, and primitive diapsids.
