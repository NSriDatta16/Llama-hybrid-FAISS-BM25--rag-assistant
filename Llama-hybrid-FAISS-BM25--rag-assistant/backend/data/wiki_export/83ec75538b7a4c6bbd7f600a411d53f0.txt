The HBT, REHIS, SST and UGES sectors have high-technology and automated infrastructure in engineering and production at Macunköy facilities. Electronic production includes surface mount technology, multilayer and flexible printed circuit boards, mechanical and mould productions, system integration and test fields. While the HBT sector's main product spectrum covers military and professional communications systems, REHIS sector's main operations are focused on radar, electronic warfare and SST sector's main operations are focused on command-control systems. The MGEO sector manufactures hybrid microelectronic circuits, night-vision devices, thermal cameras, laser ranger/designators and inertial navigation systems at Akyurt facilities.

In all business sectors, methodologies complying with military standards and ISO 9001 are  applied using computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technologies.
