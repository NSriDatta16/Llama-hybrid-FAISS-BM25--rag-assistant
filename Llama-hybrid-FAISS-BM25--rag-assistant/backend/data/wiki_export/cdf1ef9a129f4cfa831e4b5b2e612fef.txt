The Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association (RSPBA) is an association aiming to oversee pipe band competition, and to promote and encourage the development of pipe band culture worldwide. It was founded in 1930.

Overview
The RSPBA sets the rules and guidelines for pipe band contests in the United Kingdom, administers the events including coordinating adjudication, logistics, and evaluation, and holds Annual General Meetings to ensure that the rules and regulations are up to date. 

The RSPBA also administers and coordinates the  World Pipe Band Championships, held every August in Glasgow. In addition to "The World's", there are four other Major Contests - Scottish, British, European, and UK Championships. At Branch level, there are numerous contests held at Highland Games and any venue which raises the fund to hold a contest. Bands are placed in a Grade system - from Grade 4 up to Grade 1. Competitive standards are set and maintained by the Music Board, and each branch of the RSPBA may appoint two National Council members to represent their Branch Members at the national level.
