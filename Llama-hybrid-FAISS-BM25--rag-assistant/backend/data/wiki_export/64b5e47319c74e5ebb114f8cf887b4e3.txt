The Adamson Soaring Falcons are the collegiate men's varsity teams of Adamson University that play in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines which is the mother sports league of the Falcons. The collegiate women's varsity teams are called the Lady Falcons while the high school varsity teams are called the Baby Falcons and Lady Baby Falcons.

The University's varsity teams also participate in other sports leagues such as the Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup, Fr. Martin's Cup, University Games, and Premier Volleyball League.

Team mascot and colors
The school's choice of the falcon as its mascot is symbolic. Just as the falcon soars high before inflicting harm on its prey, so do the varsity teams of Adamson soar high to defeat their opponents in a sporting event.

Blue (navy blue) and White are Adamson's official school color.

Increasing participation
The mother sports league of the Adamson Falcons is the UAAP, which has tournaments in fifteen sports. Adamson does not participate in all fifteen sports or all divisions of a sport. The school authorities are now addressing this. They have set as a goal the full participation of the school in all tournaments of the UAAP.

In Season 76 (2013–14), Adamson University fielded high school team in the UAAP girls' division. This high school girls' team participates in the sport of volleyball and is called the Lady Baby Falcons. Also, in Season 76, Adamson fielded teams in the swimming tournament's men's and women's divisions. Then, in Season 77 (2014–15), Adamson fielded a football team in the men's division. In Season 79 (2016–17), Adamson fielded a team for the first time in a volleyball tournament. More teams will be fielded shortly to achieve the goal of full participation.
