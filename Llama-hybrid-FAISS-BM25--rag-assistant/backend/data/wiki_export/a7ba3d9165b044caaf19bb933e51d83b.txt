Notable events
In 2012, an Argentinian dog named Capitán was reported to have sat every evening for six years on his owner's grave. This was compounded by the fact that the family had never brought the dog to the graveyard and the dog had managed to find it himself. The municipal cemetery's director, Héctor Baccega, said that the first time he saw the dog, he arrived at the cemetery alone. The dog then did a couple of laps around the place before finding his master's grave — all on his own.  He arrives each day at 6:00 p.m.

The town has been used many times as the base of the Rally Argentina, with the streets of the town being a super special stage in 2010. It was also a stage of the 2015 and 2016 Dakar Rally.

On October 11, 2023, the town was evacuated due to a wildfire threatening the city.
