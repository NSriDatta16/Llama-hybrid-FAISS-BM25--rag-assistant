Turon (;  also known as lumpiang saging (Filipino for "banana lumpia") or sagimis in dialectal Tagalog, is a Philippine snack made of thinly sliced bananas (preferably saba or Cardaba bananas), rolled in a spring roll wrapper, fried till the wrapper is crisp and coated with caramelized brown sugar. Turon can also include other fillings. Most common is jackfruit (langka), but there are also recipes with sweet potato (kamote), mango (mangga), cheddar cheese and coconut (niyog).  

Turon, though etymologically Spanish in origin, bears no similarities to the Spanish candy turrón (an almond nougat confection). 

It is a crunchy and chewy snack most commonly consumed during merienda or for dessert.

It is also a popular street food, usually sold with banana cue, camote cue, and maruya.

History 

It has been speculated that turon making might have began in communities in the Philippines that were located near banana trees and crop fields. The extras would be given to locals when there was a surplus from the harvest, and eventually sold on the roadside. 

In Malabon, the term "turrón" or "turon" instead refers to a fried, lumpia-wrapper-enveloped dessert filled with sweet mung bean while the term valencia is used for the banana-filled variety. Malabon banana turon are generally sold as valencia trianggulo, which are uniquely triangle-shaped.

It is believed that the creation of turon was linked to the presence of Chinese culture in the Philippines prior to being colonized by Spain beginning in 1521. Other traditional Filipino dishes like pancit show  use of Chinese cooking techniques.  There have been many inspirations within Filipino culture from Chinese culture and Spanish culture. In relation to Chinese cuisine, one of which includes spring rolls and egg rolls, Filipino cuisine includes lumpia (a savory meat and veggie-filled eggroll) and turon.
