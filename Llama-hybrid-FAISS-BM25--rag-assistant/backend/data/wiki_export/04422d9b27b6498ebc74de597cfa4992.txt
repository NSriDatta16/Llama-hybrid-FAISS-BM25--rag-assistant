He has had guest roles on popular television series such as NCIS, Lost, and Crossing Jordan, and roles in films such as Almost Famous, Transformers and Anne of Green Gables.

Personal life

Litigation
In August 2011, Ward sued Warner Bros. and Enesco over merchandising for A Christmas Story after the company authorized a figure resembling his Scut Farkus character from the film without his permission. It was revealed that when he signed on to play that character, he didn't receive any merchandising rights because of a mishap with his contract. The lawsuit was dropped in January 2012 after Warner Bros. revealed that the figurine showed a "generic face" that has been used on them since 2006 and that statute of limitations had run out.

In December 2012, Ward sued Warner Bros. again over his image after attending the annual Christmas Story charity fundraiser convention in Cleveland in November 2010 after a fan handed him a Christmas Story board game, playing cards, and calendar showing his face. The lawsuit was settled three days later.
