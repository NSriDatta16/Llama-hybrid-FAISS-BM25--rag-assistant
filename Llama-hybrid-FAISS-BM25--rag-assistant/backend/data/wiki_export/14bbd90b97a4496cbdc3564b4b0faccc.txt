History
In July 1999, the First International Conference on Critical and Qualitative Approaches to Health Psychology was held in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, organized by Michael Murray; over 120 critical health psychologists from 20 countries and every continent on the globe attended the conference. It was agreed that there was a need to establish a network to connect those in health psychology throughout the world who were interested in developing a more critical approach to the subject.

In August 2001, the Second International Conference was held in Birmingham, UK.  The International Society of Critical Health Psychology was established at this conference. The founding committee members included Kerry Chamberlain, Antonia Lyons, David Marks, Michael Murray and Christine Stephens.
