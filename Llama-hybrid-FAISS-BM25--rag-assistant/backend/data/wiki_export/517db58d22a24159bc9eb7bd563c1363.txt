Carmelo Reyes González (born May 11, 1949) is a Mexican retired professional wrestler, better known by his ring name, Cien Caras ("Hundred Faces"). He is best known for his appearances with the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre.

Personal life
Carmelo Reyes González was born on May  11, 1949, in Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco, Mexico. His younger brothers, Andrés Reyes González (better known as Universo 2000) and Jesús Reyes González (known as Máscara Año 2000) also followed Carmelo into professional wrestling. Three of Carmelo Reyes' sons also followed in his footsteps, known as the masked wrestlers, known as El Cuatrero and Sansón and 
Cien Caras Místico. His nephews are also professional wrestlers, known as Forastero, Universo 2000 Jr. and Máscara Año 2000 Jr.

In Mexican wrestling there is a long tradition of wrestlers paying for the rights to use a ring name and be portrayed as a second or third-generation wrestler without actually being related. It has been confirmed that wrestlers Cien Caras Jr. and El Hijo de Cien Caras are not sons of Carlemo Reyes, while it is unclear if Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 is a blood relative or only fictional relatives. Reyes later stated that he allowed the "Cien Caras" name to be rented by other wrestlers as his sons were very young and the time and might not want to become professional wrestlers.

Professional wrestling career
After training under Diablo Velasco and Pantera Negra, Reyes debuted in 1974 under the ring name "Mil Caras", but due to the obvious confusion with Mil Máscaras, he dropped 900 units to become "Cien Caras". Caras was initially a técnico, but quickly developed a more violent wrestling style, and became a rudo. On June 24, 1987 in Nezahualcóyotl, State of Mexico, Caras defeated MS-1 for the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. He held the title until March 20, 1988, when he lost to Lizmark in Mexico City, Mexican Federal District. On September 21, 1990 he lost his mask in the culmination of a feud with Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. In late 1990, Caras was wrestling against Jalisco Jr. in a steel cage match when a fan threw a peso coin that hit Caras in the eye. He missed over a month due to the eye injury, and there was concern at the time that his career might be over.

On August 18, 1991 in Monterrey, Caras defeated Konnan el Barbaro to become the second ever CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. He held the title until leaving the CMLL in May 1992, vacating the title in the process. Caras followed Konnan to the newly formed Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, where he continued his feud with Konnan. At the inaugural TripleMania event on April 30, 1993, Caras defeated Konnan in a two out of three falls retirement match by count-out after Jake "The Snake" Roberts interfered on his behalf. Caras remained in the AAA for several years before returning to the CMLL. In one of his last matches in the promotion, he teamed with Heavy Metal and Latin Lover in a championship tournament to crown the first AAA Americas Trios Championship and lost to Los Villanos (Villano III, IV and V) at the tournament finals in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl on March 8, 1996.

In CMLL, Caras is a member of the stable Los Capos ("The Bosses") with his two younger brothers, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000 (Los Hermanos Dinamita—"The Dynamite Brothers"), and Apolo Dantes. In 2004, Caras and Mascara Año 2000 were defeated by Perro Aguayo, Jr. and El Terrible in a hair versus hair tag team match at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas: El Santo y Salvador Lutteroth show with Caras and Mascara having their heads shaved as a result. Caras and Mascara fought Aguayo, Jr. and his father, Perro Aguayo, in a second hair versus hair match in February 2005, with Caras and Mascara losing once again. The match was billed as Caras's retirement match, but he continued to wrestle in secondary CMLL venues, making him semi-retired.
