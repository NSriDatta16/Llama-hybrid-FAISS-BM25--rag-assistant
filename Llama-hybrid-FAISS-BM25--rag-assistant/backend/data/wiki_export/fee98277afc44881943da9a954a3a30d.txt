Tormentor is a Hungarian black metal band formed in 1986 in Budapest. They recorded their first album, Anno Domini, in 1988, but were unable to release it until the end of communist rule in Hungary. The album reached Norway through the tape-trading community. Following the suicide of Per Ohlin, Mayhem invited Attila Csihar from Tormentor to join the band; he was to perform the vocals on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Tormentor split up in 1991. After a long break they reformed and released the more experimental Recipe Ferrum through Avantgarde Music in 2001, going on a long indefinite hiatus afterwards.

Reunion
In 2017, Tormentor reunited after several years to re-emerge on the stage for a highly publicized reunion show on 21 April 2018, in Budapest, followed by an appearance at the Brutal Assault in Josefov, Czech Republic and the Beyond the Gates festival in Bergen, Norway, with later performances at festivals in France and Canada to cap off the year.

The band reunited in the classic lineup from 1988 with Csihar on vocals, Tamás Buday and Attila Szigeti sharing guitar duties, György Farkas handling bass guitar, and Machat St. Zsoltar on drums. The band's own recording imprint, Saturnus Productions, has also reissued both the cult classic debut album Anno Domini and The Seventh Day of Doom demo on CD and vinyl.
