Plum TV was an American broadcast television network targeted mostly to affluent viewers in the country. The majority of the programming was locally produced largely in affluent vacation communities, marketed towards the mass affluent.

History
Plum TV was launched in 2004 by Tom Scott of Nantucket Nectars, film producer Cary Woods, Chris Glowacki, and general manager Brook Altman. Investors have included singer Jimmy Buffett, then-MTV head Tom Freston and Jason Flom.

On January 3, 2012, Plum TV, Inc. and a number of affiliated companies filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court. According to court filings, the companies projected losses of $8.4 million on revenues of $6.4 million and their liabilities exceeded their assets by over $10 million ($19 million in liabilities vs. $8.6 million in assets). They intended to sell their assets to PMG Media Group, LLC for $1 million in cash plus the assumption of certain obligations, subject to higher offers. In March 2012, Morgan Hertzan and Joseph Varet took over as co-presidents of Plum. Hertzan and Varet are former MTV executives and co-founders of LXTV.

In early October 2012, Plum TV received more funding, $4.4 million, from additional investors including Baroda Ventures and Double M Partners. Plum TV also added two Titan Broadcast Management stations, WMFP-TV in Boston and WTVE in Philadelphia, as affiliates in a move to go nationwide.
