Joel Antônio Martins (23 November 1931 – 1 January 2003), known as just Joel, was an association football winger.

Biography
Joel was born 23 November 1931 in Rio de Janeiro. His football career began when he was discovered by Botafogo in 1948, at the age of 17 years. Two years later, however, he moved to Flamengo where he won the Rio State Championship for three times in a row (1953, 1954, 1955).

Joel had caps for Brazil between 1957 and 1961. He was in the starting line-up on the first two matches of 1958 FIFA World Cup, but then he went to the bench replaced by Garrincha, just like his Flamengo's teammate Dida was replaced by Pelé.
