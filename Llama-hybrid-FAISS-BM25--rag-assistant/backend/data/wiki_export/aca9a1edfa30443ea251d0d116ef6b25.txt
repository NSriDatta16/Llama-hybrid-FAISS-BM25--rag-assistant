Arthur Edward Cleeve Horne, , (January 9, 1912 – July 5, 1998) was a Canadian portrait painter and sculptor.

Career
Born in Jamaica, British West Indies, Horne came to Canada with his parents in 1913. When he was around nine years of age, recovering from pneumonia, his mother gave him modelling clay to pass the time. He did a head of Shakespeare which won a prize at the Canadian National Exhibition. By age 15, he was exhibiting with the Royal Canadian Academy.

In Horne's early career, he wanted to become a portrait sculptor and studied under Dorothy Dick, a British sculptor (1927-1928). From 1931 to 1934, he attended the Ontario College of Art and Design, Toronto, first studying sculpture under Emanuel Hahn but soon changing to painting with J. W. Beatty. He also studied portrait and landscape painting under John Wentworth Russell (1934-1935). He was told by Emanuel Hahn, "A sculptor can never change his hand and become a painter." Horne, however, achieved much more acclaim as a painter than a sculptor.

Horne was primarily a society painter. He is thought to have painted over 400 portraits during his career ca.(1928–1991). His most notable subjects include Alexander Graham Bell, Claude Bissell, Bora Laskin, Pauline Mills McGibbon, Jeanne Sauvé, Colonel R. Samuel McLaughlin and John Diefenbaker among many others. He held his first exhibition in 1935, his second in 1937, and served as a camouflage officer in the army in the Second World War and retired with the rank of Captain. Cleeve Horne died at Toronto, Ontario, Canada of a respiratory-related illness in 1998.
