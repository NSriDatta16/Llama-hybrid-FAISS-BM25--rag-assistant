Ammoudia (, before 1928: Σπλάντζα - Splantza,) is a small fishing village in the municipal unit of Fanari in the municipality of Parga, Preveza regional unit in Epirus, Greece. Ammoudia is located on the Ionian Sea coast,  southeast of Parga. The mouth of the river Acheron is in the village.

History
During the Axis occupation Ammoudia was among the villages targeted by a joint German-Cham Albanian armed operation in August 1943.

A primary school Greek teacher (S. Georgoulas) who taught in the area in the 1960s noted in a report he compiled for the Research Center of Greek Folklore that in 1964 that most inhabitants of the village spoke Albanian ) and had no knowledge of Greek. For Georgoulas, the continued presence of Albanian in the village caused "unimaginable spiritual and cultural damage".
