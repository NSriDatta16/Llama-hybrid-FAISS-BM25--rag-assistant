History
Petrolina de Goiás owes its origin to the fertility of the soils of the basin of the Córrego Descoberto.  Joaquim Pedro and his family donated lands to create the settlement and build a chapel to honor Santa Maria Eterna.  The first name was "Descoberto" but this was changed to "Petrolina" in honor of the founder, Pedro.  In 1932 it became a district in the municipality of Jaraguá.  In 1943 the name was changed to "Goialina", only to be changed again in 1948 to Petrolina de Goiás.
