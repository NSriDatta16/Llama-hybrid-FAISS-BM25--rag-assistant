Fabrizio del Monte (born 5 December 1980 in Latina, Lazio) is an Italian racing driver.

He drove for three seasons in European Formula 3000 before driving three Champ Car events in 2005, often on the strength of sponsorship.  He said he had secured Midland's third driver seat for the 2006 San Marino Grand Prix, but this fell through due to lack of sponsorship.  His place was taken by Giorgio Mondini. Del Monte was also to be the team's third driver in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
