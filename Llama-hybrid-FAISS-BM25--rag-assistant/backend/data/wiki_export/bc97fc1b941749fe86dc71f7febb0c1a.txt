How Dare You! is the fourth album by British band 10cc. Released in 1976, it included UK hit singles "I'm Mandy Fly Me" and "Art for Art's Sake". The album was the band's third to have cover artwork by the Hipgnosis creative team.

It was also the last 10cc album by the original line-up of Eric Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme (the latter two departed shortly thereafter to form Godley & Creme), until the four reformed (albeit briefly) for the 1992 album ...Meanwhile.

Writing and recording 
In an interview at the time of its release, Gouldman told Melody Maker music newspaper: "It's as different as any album by the same band can be, and I think it's a progression from the last one. I think there's been a progression on every album and I think we've done it again. It's a strange mixture of songs. There's one about divorce, a song about schizophrenia, a song about wanting to rule the world, the inevitable money song, and an instrumental."

Critical reception 

Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in his review of the album: "The putrefaction isn't as extreme as on last year's hit album, but the affliction would seem permanent—they don't know whether they're supposed to be funny or pretty, and so nine times out of ten they're neither."
