Real Things is the third album by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance act 2 Unlimited, released in 1994. It was the band's second number one album in the UK and despite spending just nine weeks in the UK Albums Chart Top 75, it was certified gold there and platinum in The Netherlands. "The Real Thing", "Here I Go", "No One" and "Nothing Like the Rain" were released as singles. Unlike their previous album, Ray Slijngaard's raps on the verses were not cut for the UK release.

Critical reception

Generally, the music press were kinder to this album than previous album No Limits!. Beau Quantick from NME gave it eight out of ten. Tim Marsh from Select noted that "The Real Thing" "has a funky key riff", while "Sensuality" and "Something Wild" "explore darker sounds." Smash Hits''' Mark Sutherland stated that "every song is a potential top 10 record" and that "for techno [...] mayhem, you can't beat Real Things''".
