The Fire and Rescue Department of Malaysia (, Jawi: جابتن بومبا دان ڤڽلامت مليسيا), commonly known as Bomba, is a federal agency of Malaysia responsible for firefighting and technical rescue. Bomba is a Malay word derived from the Portuguese bombeiros which means 'firefighters'.

History 
Firefighting services in Malaysia began in 1883 with the establishment of the Selangor fire and rescue volunteers led by H.F. Bellamy, with 15 active personnel. The Malayan Union Fire Services (MUS), based in Kuala Lumpur, was established after World War II, headed by Flight Lt. W.J. German.

The firefighting services became the responsibility of state governments after the Malaysia Federation Agreement. The services were then integrated as a federal-level department on 1 January 1976, reporting to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The department received a new name on 15 May 1981: "The Malaysian Fire Services Department".

On 8 January 1997, the Malaysian Ministerial Cabinet agreed to change the coat of arms, flag, and name of the Malaysian Fire Services Department to the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department. These were officially launched in a ceremony at the Genting Highlands Fire and Rescue Station in Pahang on 21 February 1997, by Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad.

Fire and Rescue Academy 

There are five Fire and Rescue Academy of Malaysia (FRAM) () campuses which includes:
 FRAM Central Region, Kuala Kubu Bharu, Selangor.
 FRAM Eastern Region, Wakaf Tapai, Marang, Terengganu.
 FRAM Northern Region, Tronoh, Perak.
 FRAM Sabah Region, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah.
 FRAM Sarawak Region, Kuching, Sarawak.

FRAM offers certificate and diploma level courses in fire and rescue.

FRAM has a Band Unit that is attached to FRAM Central Region.

Auxiliary Fire Service & Volunteer Firefighting Teams 
On 4 May 2014, the Malaysian Government re-established the Auxiliary Fire Service () in conjunction with the International Firefighters' Day celebrations at Merdeka Square, Kuala Lumpur. The re-establishment was officiated by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Tan Sri Muhyidin Yassin. Historically, the Auxiliary Fire Service was first formed in 1940. Then, after World War II, they were absorbed into the regular fire services.

There are some differences between Auxiliaries and Volunteers. Auxiliary Firefighters () are formally trained at FRAM, while the Volunteer Firefighters receive their training at state and district fire stations. Auxiliary Firefighters are governed by the Fire Services Act 1988 and receive an allowance from the government. Volunteer Firefighters do not receive allowances from the government but are citizen volunteers serving as part of Volunteer Firefighting Teams based at Volunteer Fire Stations paid for by their local community. They are covered through insurance paid for by the Malaysian Government. Previously registered and governed by the Registrar of Societies, Volunteer Firefighters will now be registered and governed directly by the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department after Parliament passed the Fire Services (Amendment) Act 2018.

Mountain Search and Rescue 
After the Sabah earthquake that happened on 5 June 2015 affected Ranau and Mount Kinabalu, a specialist Mountain Search and Rescue team (MOSAR) was formed out of the Kinabalu Mountain Guides of Sabah Parks on 23 June 2015. In a ceremony at Ranau Fire Station, 20 Kinabalu Mountain Guides were appointed as Auxiliary Firefighters and designated as the founding members of MOSAR. The ceremony was officiated by the then Minister of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government, Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan.

MOSAR takes its place among Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department's specialist rescue units, which includes the Special Tactical Operation and Rescue Team of Malaysia (STORM) and the Multi Skill Team (MUST).

Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force 
Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force () traces their history back to 1883. The modern Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force was formed in 1987 and protected under Section 62 (1) (CA) Fire and Rescue Services Act 1988. Each Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force has their own fire stations, fire trucks, and equipment, which are usually sponsored by local industry.

The primary role of the Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force is to perform firefighting operations in their community. In case of fire emergencies in their community, the volunteers are the first there to control if not extinguish the fire. Their secondary role is to be the link between JBPM and their local community. In addition, they are entrusted by JBPM to spread awareness regarding to fire safety.

The Volunteer Fire and Rescue Force train regularly in district fire stations so that they and their equipment are in good shape for fire emergencies. The volunteers can be easily identified by their yellow Firefighting Operations Dress.
