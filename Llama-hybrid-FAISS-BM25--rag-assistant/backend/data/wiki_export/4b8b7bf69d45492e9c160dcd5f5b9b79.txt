Medlar Field at Lubrano Park is a 5,570-seat baseball stadium in University Park, Pennsylvania, that hosted its first regular season baseball game on June 20, 2006, when the State College Spikes lost to the Williamsport Crosscutters, 5–3. The Penn State Nittany Lions college baseball team began play at the ballpark in 2007.

Seating capacity is 5,570 people. Events other than baseball games are held at the ballpark, and different seating configurations are available.

This stadium was designed to feature an unobstructed view of Penn State landmark Mount Nittany over the outfield wall.

History
Penn State alumnus Anthony Lubrano first suggested upgrading Penn State baseball facilities to representatives of the university in 1995. After receiving a donation from Lubrano in 2002, the Penn State Board of Trustees voted to name the new stadium Medlar Field at Lubrano Park. In 2003, representatives of the Altoona Curve management group approached Penn State with the idea of sharing a ballpark that both the Altoona Curve and the Penn State baseball team would use as a home field.

Final plans for the new ballpark were approved by the Penn State Board of Trustees on May 13, 2005. Ground was broken for the new ballpark on May 18, 2005.  Among the dignitaries on hand for the groundbreaking ceremony were Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, Penn State president Graham Spanier, state Senator Jake Corman and Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley.

The ballpark was named a 2006 Project of the Year in the area of sports by Mid-Atlantic Construction.

Naming
Medlar Field at Lubrano Park is named for two Penn State alumni, Charles Medlar and Anthony Lubrano. Coach Charles "Chuck" Medlar (1918–1999) was an athletic trainer at Penn State for 35 years, and the head Penn State baseball coach from 1963 to 1981. The Charles Medlar Award is given annually in his honor to the outstanding pitcher of the Penn State baseball team.

Anthony Lubrano is a 1982 alumnus of the Penn State Smeal College of Business. Since graduation, Lubrano has established a successful financial services company. His donation of $2.5 million towards this project made him the lead benefactor, and Lubrano received from Penn State the opportunity to name this venue. Lubrano chose to name this venue Medlar Field at Lubrano Park in recognition of Coach Medlar's contributions to Penn State athletics.

Features
The "footprint" of the stadium (outfield dimensions, foul ground, etc.)  is identical to PNC Park in Pittsburgh (home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) except for the right field wall. At PNC, the wall is 21 feet tall, but at Medlar Field, it is 18.55 feet tall to commemorate the year that Penn State was founded. The physical plant of this venue includes the stadium, parking areas, and a pedestrian plaza. The stadium has three levels, Field (clubhouse) Level, Concourse Level, and Luxury Suite Level. The street level entrance to the stadium is on the Concourse Level.

Wheelchair–accessible seating is located on the concourse behind the Bullpen Box, Field Box, and Diamond Club seating areas.
