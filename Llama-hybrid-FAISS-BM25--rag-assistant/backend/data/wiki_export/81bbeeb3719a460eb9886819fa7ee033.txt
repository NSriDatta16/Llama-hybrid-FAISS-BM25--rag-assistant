First leg

The match was briefly interrupted for an intervention by the fire brigade due to Partizan fans starting a large fire at the stadium's east stand by burning the high jump sponge mat. Furthermore, Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini got hit in the head with a coin thrown from the stands as Partizan fans pelted the pitch with missiles following one of the Roma goals. In addition to the SFr200,000 monetary fine, UEFA punished Partizan with a one-match stadium ban, enforced for their 1989–90 Cup Winners' Cup first round tie versus Celtic.
