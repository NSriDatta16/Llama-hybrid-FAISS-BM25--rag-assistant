History
Baffa may date back to or prior to Sikh rule. It was given the status of a municipality in 1873 during British rule as a principal market town in Northern Hazara and of the neighbouring independent tracts. In 1901, the population was 7,029.

A vernacular middle school was maintained by the municipality and the District board. Baffa remained the educational hub for the Pakkhal valley, Konsh valley and Siran Valley because of the accommodation facility (hostel) attached to the Government Higher Secondary School there. At that time, this was the only high school for these three big valleys. The Municipal Committee of Mansehra took credits from the Municipal Committee of Baffa to fulfill its expenditures because the Municipal Committee of Baffa's income and revenue was more than Mansehra's.

Baffa is the resting place of Mulana Ghous Hazarvi and, historically, the rallying point for Turks in the region.
