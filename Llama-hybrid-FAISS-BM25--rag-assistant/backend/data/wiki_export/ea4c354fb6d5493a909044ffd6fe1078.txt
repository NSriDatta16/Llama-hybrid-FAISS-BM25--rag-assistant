Zwieselberg is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

History
Zwieselberg is first mentioned in 1345 as der Zwiselberg.

The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are a Bronze Age ruin at Bürgli and a grave at Bühl.  A small Roman settlement was built on the ruin at Bürgli.  The Romans also built a lime kiln at Chalchmädere.  During the Middle Ages the region was part of the Herrschaft of Strättligen.  In 1466 the Bernese Lords of Bubenberg acquired the Strättligen lands, including Zwieselberg.  Toward the end of the 15th century, the Bubenbergs sold or gave Zwieselberg and the surrounding lands to the city of Bern.  Under Bernese rule it was part of the bailiwick of Wimmis, the military levy of Seftigen and the religious parish of Amsoldingen.  Following the 1798 French invasion and 1803 Act of Mediation it joined the newly created Thun District.

In 1815 the Simmentalstrasse connected the old horse stations of Hani and Glütsch in Zwieselberg to the rest of the canton.  The municipality has remained rural and generally agrarian.  Today about half of the local jobs are in agriculture, though nearly three-quarters of the working population commutes to jobs in or around Bern and Thun.

In 2008 Zwieselberg, Reutigen, Oberstocken and Niederstocken formed the Stockental School District.
