In 2011, the Romanian Police had roughly 10,500 intervention vehicles.

Today, the fleet is composed largely of BMW 3 Series, Dacia Logan, Dacia Duster and Volswagen Polo vehicles, with Mercedes Vito and Volkswagen Transporter T6 models used by the special forces and border police. Very few old Volkswagen Passat are also in service. The Road/Traffic Police also has BMW motorbikes, Seat, Lotus and Alfa Romeo vehicles, used for road chasing.

In 2020, the Ministry of Interior Affairs acquired 6,744 brand new vehicles which would also feature a new painting scheme, similar to those in Germany or Sweden. These were delivered in autumn 2020 and had been produced at the local Dacia factory in Mioveni. A significant part of the acquired vehicles are Dacia Duster (2018 model year), being the first time a crossover SUV is introduced in the force on a large, nationwide scale and Dacia Logan (2017 model year, newest at the time of acquisition).

In July 2022, following a controversial auction, the General Inspectorate of the Romanian Police finalised the acquisition of 600 BMW 3 Series 320i xDrive Sedan vehicles (2023 model year). These have engines that have a power output of 184 hp (125 kW) and 300Nm torque, 8+1 speed automatic transmissions, all wheel drive, accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 7.7 seconds and reach a top speed of 230 km/h. The cars are painted in white and are G20 3 Series LCI models. The specific equipment consists of the new Romanian Police blue-yellow reflective livery, lightbar, additional battery and socket in the trunk, a set of winter tires and extended warranty. The price of each vehicle was €33,200 with the total acquisition being cofinanced by the European Union through the Big Infrastructure Operational Program (Programul Operațional Infrastructură Mare, POIM). Such, 300 vehicles were financed by the EU and 300 by the Romanian State.

In March 2023, the first batch of the vehicles purchased in 2022 was delivered and they were inaugurated with the occasion of the Romaian Police Day event.

The police also uses helicopters for air surveillance and immediate response. The most common manufacturer is Eurocopter.

Before 2002, the National Police had military status and a military ranking system (see Romanian Armed Forces ranks and insignia). In June 2002 it became a civilian police force (one of the first police services in Eastern Europe) and its personnel was structured into two corps:
