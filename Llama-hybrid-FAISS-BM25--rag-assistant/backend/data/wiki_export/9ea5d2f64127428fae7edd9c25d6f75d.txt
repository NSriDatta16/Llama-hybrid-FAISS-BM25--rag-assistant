Plot
Akasha Gopuram is set among the Indian immigrant community in London and tells the story of Albert Samson, a middle-aged architect who has  clawed his way to prominence.

His single-minded focus on his job, however, has hardened him and prevented him and his wife Alice from having a meaningful family life. The costs of Samson's ambition are also symbolized in his assistant, Abraham Thomas, Samson's own former employer whom he treated badly to reach the top. Thomas, now dying, wants his son Alex to have more independence in the firm. Samson, however, fears that he will be eclipsed by a younger generation of architects, and refuses to allow Alex either to design original houses or to leave the firm and strike out on his own.

Into this tense situation, enter Hilda Varghese, a vivacious young woman who idolized Samson ten years ago when, in the early stages of his career, he built a large church in her hometown and climbed to the top of its tower during its dedication ceremony.  At that time Samson had promised "a kingdom" to Hilda, then a girl of twelve; now, Hilda who earnestly believes his word has come to collect her kingdom.

As Samson struggles with the destructive consequences of his pursuit of glory and his growing fear that he has lost his creative powers, the mysterious Hilda helps him gain a glimpse of his former self.
