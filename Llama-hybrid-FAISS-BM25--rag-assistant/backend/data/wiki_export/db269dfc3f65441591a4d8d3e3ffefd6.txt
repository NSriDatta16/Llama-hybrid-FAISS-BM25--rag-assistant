Ballycassidy racehorse
There is also a racehorse called Ballycassidy, named after the village, who was trained in Wales by Peter Bowen. The horse is notorious for a spectacular fall at Valentines Brook in the 2006 Grand National at Aintree. He won 16 races over his career and became a  favourite with racing fans.  He was retired from racing under rules in 2008, but did go on to race in Point to Points, ridden by the then amateur jockey Donal Devereux.  Ballycassidy remains at the Peter Bowen stables.
