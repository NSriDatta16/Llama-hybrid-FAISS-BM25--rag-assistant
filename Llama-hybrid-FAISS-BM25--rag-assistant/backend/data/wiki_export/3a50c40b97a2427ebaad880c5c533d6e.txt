The Shizuoka Derby is a commonly occurring football fixture in Japan. The game  takes place between the two professional J. League teams in Shizuoka Prefecture; Shimizu S-Pulse and Júbilo Iwata. The game is usually hosted at Ecopa Stadium, the prefecture's largest sporting venue. In the two 2007 J-League season meetings, S-Pulse triumphed both times. Firstly 2–1 at Nihondaira Stadium in May, and then 1–0 in September at Ecopa.

The Shizuoka Derby's rivalry factors include: the common prefecture (historically, Shizuoka Prefecture was divided into three provinces, Suruga Province, Tōtōmi Province and Izu Province; Shimizu would represent Suruga and Iwata would represent Tōtōmi); and the fact that Júbilo supporters feel that Shimizu should not have been chosen for the J. League as it had not competed in the Japan Soccer League beforehand (whereas the old Yamaha Motor Corporation club that preceded Júbilo had gone all the way to the old title).
