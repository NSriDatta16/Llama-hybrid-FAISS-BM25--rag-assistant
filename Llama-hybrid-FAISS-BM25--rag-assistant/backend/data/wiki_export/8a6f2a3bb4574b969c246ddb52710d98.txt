The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) is an inter-governmental forum whose aim is to co-ordinate efforts to deal with debris in orbit around the Earth founded in 1993. The primary purposes of the IADC is information exchange on space debris research activities, facilitating opportunities for joint research, and reviewing progress of ongoing activities. All of these are designed to support identification of space debris mitigation options.

Debris mitigation guidance 
In March 2020, the organization has developed recommendations that each program or project establish and document a feasible Space Debris Mitigation Plan. The plan should include the following items:
 A management plan addressing space debris mitigation activities
 A plan for the assessment and mitigation of risks related to space debris, including applicable standards
 The measures minimising the hazard related to malfunctions that have a potential for generating space debris
 A plan for disposal of the spacecraft and/or orbital stages at end of mission
 Justification of choice and selection when several possibilities exist
 Compliance matrix addressing the recommendations of these Guidelines
