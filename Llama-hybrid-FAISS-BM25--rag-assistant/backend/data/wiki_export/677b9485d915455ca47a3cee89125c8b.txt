History 

Originally it was a part of Baku State University. It became a separate university in 1930. Over the years its name has changed a number of times and it was re-merged and re-separated from Baku State on several occasions.  On its creation in 1930, the school was named the Trade-Cooperative Institute.  In 1933, the government of Azerbaijan SSR changed the name to the "Azerbaijan Social-Economic University named after Karl Marx" (similar to the naming of the Azerbaijan Medical University named after Nariman Narimanov), and introduced curricula on accounting, law and finance.  In 1936 the name was tweaked to the "Azerbaijan Social-Economic Institute named after Karl Marx".  With the onset of World War II, UNEC was folded into Baku State University's Department of Economics.  By 1944 the school was separated again, this time as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute.  It remained under this name until March 1959, when war caused it to be folded back into Baku State University.

In 1966 the school separated once again, and has remained independent since, initially as the Azerbaijan National Economic Institute named after Dadash Bunyadzade.  In 1987 the name was changed to the Finance-Economic Institute; and in 2000 the name was finally changed to its current form by an act of the Azerbaijani government.

Derbent branch 
The Derbent branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University was founded in 1993 by Heydar Aliyev. However, the official opening of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Economic University in the city of Derbent of the Republic of Dagestan of the Russian Federation was held only in November 2016. The total area of the Derbent branch is more than 11 thousand km2. There are 32 classrooms in the university, with a total capacity of 1,000 students. In the first year 69 people were recruited to the university. At the moment, students can study in four areas:

 World economy
 Finance and credit
 Accounting, analysis and audit
 General Economy

Along with this, branch students also can enjoy all the privileges and international relations of the university – so they can also receive double diplomas and participate in international exchanges.

Zagatala branch 
Under the Azerbaijan State University of Economics, there is also a branch in one of the north-western cities of Azerbaijan – Zagatala. The basis of the Zagatala branch was laid on the basis of the branch of the Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan of April 29, 2016. The official opening of the branch took place on September 15, 2016. Training takes place in 4 main directions:

 Business management
 Finance
 Accounting
 Economy

The first set included 113 students from 37 different regions of Azerbaijan.

International cooperation 
The Azerbaijan State University of Economics has connections with foreign universities.

Thus, ASUE cooperates with the Siegen University of Germany in the direction of organizing summer and winter schools. In 2016, a winter school was held at the University of Siegen, in which participated teachers and students from both universities. A joint project entitled "Entrepreneurship education: as the main factor in creation of jobs and employment in Azerbaijan" started in 2016 and is planned to be completed in 2019.

UNEC was declared the winner of the TEMPUS IV program of the 6th convocation for a project called "Development and improvement of university management in the field of international relations". As a winner, ASUE was awarded a grant for implementation by the European Commission. In 2017, this project, whose goal was the formation of international relations based on the attraction of students and teachers in the international educational environment, was realized. Closing ceremony was attended by such personalities as the rector of ASUE Adalat Muradov, head of the office of the national program Erasmus+ Azerbaijan Parviz Bagirov, representative of the Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Yashar Omarov, UK University of Warwick Fellow James Kennedy, Vice-Rector for International Relations and Programs ASUE Shahin Bayramov and as well as representatives of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.

In 2015, for the first time in Azerbaijan, ASUE joined the International Program of the London University – the London School of Economics (LSE). Within the framework of this program, ASUE students receive education both in accordance with the curriculum of ASUE and in the curriculum of the London School of Economics. Students are provided with all the necessary materials and benefits, and upon completion of the training the students of this program receive two diplomas.

In addition to the London School of Economics and Politics, students can receive a second diploma from the French University of Montpellier in 2016. This can be done in two ways: students can go to the University of Montpellier from the third year to continue their studies for a year there, or continue their studies at ASUE, but according to the curricula of Montpellier. In both cases, students receive accreditation and a second diploma from the University of Montpellier.

Interesting facts

Setting for Novel Ali and Nino 
Kurban Said's landmark novel, Ali and Nino, opens in a classroom in the Economics University building in Baku. Ali Khan, the protagonist, took his final graduation exams in that building, which is located on one of Baku's most prestigious streets – Independence (Istiglaliyyat), though at the time of the novel, it was called Nikolay Street, named after the Russian czar Nicholas II. Nino's school, now Public School No. 132, was located across the street.

Curiously, both Yusif Vazir (Chamanzaminli) (1887-1943), the Core Author of Ali and Nino, as well as Essad Bey / Lev Nussimbaum (1905-1942) both attended this school. Vazirov attended Baku Realni High School (having transferred in as a refugee from Shusha) beginning in 1906 and he graduated in 1909.

Lev Nussimbaum attended Men's Gymnasium No. 2, which at that time (1914-1920) was housed inside Baku Realni. Though Nussimbaum was often absent due to sickness and political unrest, he was enrolled from Junior Preparatory to the beginning of Fourth Grade when he fled the Bolshevik takeover of the Baku government (1920). This school offered classes through Eighth Grade. Documents indicate that Nussimbaum failed his Azerbaijani class in 1919, the only time records exist showing that he had enrolled in Azerbaijani.

For the first time in the country, the 7/24 library at UNEC allows students to easily prepare for classes and exams.
