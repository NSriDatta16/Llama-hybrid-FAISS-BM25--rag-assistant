Docklands Buses Limited, trading as Go-Ahead London, is a bus company operating in East London. The Docklands Buses brand is a subsidiary of Go-Ahead London and operates services under contract to Transport for London.

History
Docklands Buses was formed by Harry Blundred's Transit Holdings in 1988 as Docklands Transit. It initially operated local commercial routes using Ford Transit minibuses, but these proved not to be viable so it switched to operating tendered Transport for London services. Stagecoach purchased the bus side of the company in 1997, and Docklands Transit continued operating private hire vehicles. In 2002, Docklands Buses commenced operating route 167, soon winning other contracts.

In September 2006 the company was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.
