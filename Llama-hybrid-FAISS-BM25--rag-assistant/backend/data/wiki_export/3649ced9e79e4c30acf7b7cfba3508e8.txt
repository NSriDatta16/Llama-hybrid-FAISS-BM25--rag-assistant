History
Sigma Iota Epsilon began as a recognition society for management students, accepting both men and women from inception, in  at the University of Illinois. Rather than founding members, it was formed as a merger of three local industrial management and general management fraternities located at the University of Illinois, Syracuse University, and the University of Texas.  The Society notes that sponsoring professors A.G. Anderson at Illinois, Maurice C. Cross at Syracuse and Chester F. Lay at Texas coordinated the merger of the local societies they led.

More recently, the society has adopted aspects of both an honor society and a professional fraternity.

As of the 19th edition of Baird's Manual, a total of 33 active chapters and 7 inactive chapters was reported, with approximately 7,500 initiates.  The Society has grown since then to include 73 active chapters.
