The Mountain Brook School System serves the city of Mountain Brook, a area outside of Birmingham, Alabama, United States. The school system supports a city with approximately 20,600 residents. The system was established in 1959 in order to avoid federal desegregation.

The school system is one of the most segregated school districts in America.  Educators and students have recently tried to implement diversity programming following anti-Semitic events working with the Anti-Defamation League, but the School Board cut ties with the Anti-Defamation League after hearing parent opposition.

The Mountain Brook School System has four elementary schools that serve kindergarten through the sixth grade. These schools are Brookwood Forest Elementary School, Cherokee Bend Elementary School, Crestline Elementary School, and Mountain Brook Elementary School. Upon completion of the sixth grade, students flow into Mountain Brook Junior High School where they attend seventh through ninth grades. The school system has only one high school, Mountain Brook High School, which serves grades ten through twelve.

The school system has enjoyed a low rate of turnover in its leadership.  In 2009, the system celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding and that year marked the hiring of Dicky Barlow, former principal of Mountain Brook High School, as only the 4th superintendent in the 50-year history of the system.

There is also a private school, Highlands Day School, within Mountain Brook's city limits, but it is not part of the Mountain Brook School System.

In 2019, Niche ranked the system the 24th best school district in America.  In 2017, Mountain Brook Elementary was named a State School of Character, one of only two in Alabama to receive this honor. Schools that receive this recognition demonstrate a dedicated focus on character development.  Newsweek Magazine recognized MBHS as one of the nation's top 100 high schools. In 2016, Mountain Brook Schools was named the international Outstanding District by the International Society for Technology in Education.

Mountain Brook City Schools Foundation

Since 1992, the Mountain Brook School System's funding has been significantly enhanced its own foundation, lessening its dependence on state funds with each passing year. Any funds raised as a result of the foundation's actions are added to a permanent endowment that is used to support any of the school's academic needs.

Since its inception, the foundation's main focus has been in the areas of technology, professional development, and library enhancement. Because of the endowment, the foundation has been able to commit over $5 million in grants to the school system between 1995 and 2013. According to MBCSF, this money was used to complete 55,628 hours of teacher training, purchase in excess of 600 computer workstations, and add 4,500 books to its libraries.

In 2004, the Mountain Brook City Schools Foundation launched its first public campaign since 1996. The idea behind the Aim Higher campaign was to allow anyone in the Mountain Brook Community a chance to "invest in the future of Mountain Brook by investing in the education of its young people." The plan was to ask every family in the school system to contribute at least $1,500 over a three- to five-year period, with donations totaling $2 million, allowing Mountain Brook's endowment to grow to approximately $9 million. With $8.2 million raised, the foundation is nearing its goal.
