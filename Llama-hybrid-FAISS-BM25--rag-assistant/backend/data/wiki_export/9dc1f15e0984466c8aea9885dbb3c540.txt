Drummoyne was created in 1913. With the introduction of proportional representation, it was absorbed into the multi-member electorate of Ryde, but recreated in 1927. For much of the early 1900s, it was a marginal seat. Between the 1960s and 2000s, Drummoyne was a -leaning seat. Currently, the electoral district is represented by Independent John Sidoti, formerly of the Liberal Party.

Notably, the electorate was the scene of future Liberal Prime Minister John Howard's first run for parliament, in 1968.
