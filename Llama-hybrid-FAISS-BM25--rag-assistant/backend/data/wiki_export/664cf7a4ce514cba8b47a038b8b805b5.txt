The  was the top singles women's professional wrestling championship in All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (AJW) from 1970 until it closed in 2006. It was also known in Pro Wrestling Illustrated and other London Publishing wrestling magazines as the All-Japan Women's International Championship. The title was descended from the original Women's World Championship, which Mildred Burke won in 1937.

On September 2, 2017, the title was revived for one day by former AJW wrestlers Kumiko Maekawa, Manami Toyota, Nanae Takahashi and Yumiko Hotta at an independent event produced by Hotta. The soon-to-retire Toyota then defeated Hotta and was awarded the title belt.
