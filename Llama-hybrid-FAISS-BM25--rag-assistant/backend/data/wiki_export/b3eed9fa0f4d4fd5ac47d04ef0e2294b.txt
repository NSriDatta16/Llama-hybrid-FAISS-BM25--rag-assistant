Paul Roberts (born 31 December 1959 in Chiswick, London) is an English singer who was the lead singer of The Stranglers between 1990 and 2006.

Career

The Stranglers
Roberts replaced Hugh Cornwell in The Stranglers in 1990 and appeared on and co-wrote their studio albums Stranglers In the Night, About Time, Written in Red, Coup de Grace and Norfolk Coast.

Roberts performed live as a non-playing frontman as The Stranglers recruited guitarist John Ellis and later Baz Warne to co-replace Cornwell, who sang vocals and played guitar.

Roberts left The Stranglers after almost 16 years (believed to be longer than his predecessor, according to press quotes from his former colleagues) in May 2006. The split was officially described as "amicable." The band reverted to a four-piece, with Warne taking over lead vocals and Jean-Jacques Burnel returning to singing songs on which he had originally provided lead vocals.

Solo / Faith Band / Soulsec
As a side project to The Stranglers, Roberts also played and recorded as Paul Roberts, Paul Roberts and The Faith Band and The Faith Band, who post Stranglers changed to Soulsec.  Releases included the albums Faith? (Paul Roberts, 1999], Self Discovery (Paul Roberts and The Faithband, 2001), The Pressure Sensitive (The Faithband, 2003) and End Games (Soulsec, 2007).  Also the singles "God", "When Reason Sleeps", "8 Days" and "Swim". There have also been several acoustic/electric live and compilation CDs.

Roberts played the role of Pop Larkin in the world premiere of Perfick: The Darling Buds of May Musical. This was a musical based on H. E. Bates' novel The Darling Buds of May, written by David Burton. The show ran for a week in April 2008 at The Kings Theatre, Southsea as a trial to see whether the company could raise enough interest to finance a West End production. The show did not open on the West End.
