"Maybe I'm a Leo" is a song by the English rock group Deep Purple, from their 1972 album Machine Head.

History 
Roger Glover says: "I wrote the riff to "Maybe I'm a Leo" after hearing John Lennon's "How Do You Sleep?". I liked the idea that the riff didn't start on the down beat, like 99% of riffs do. Most of the songs on Machine Head were from the first take, or not long after."

Singer Ian Gillan is a Leo (born 19 August), the only group member at the time with that astrological sign.

The song was rarely played by the band live; however, three live recordings of it have been released on albums: Deep Purple in Concert, recorded in 1972; Live at the Olympia '96; and Live at Montreux 2011.

The SACD version of Machine Head has an alternative guitar solo on "Maybe I'm a Leo".
