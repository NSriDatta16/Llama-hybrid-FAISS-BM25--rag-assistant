The Romans built some bridges along the Rio Nalon.

In the Middle Ages the area was held by the Order of Santiago. In  1528 Philip II sold Sobrescobio for the price of 600,000 Maravedí to the Benedictine Monastery of San Vicente of Oviedo. To this occasion dates the first documented use of the town's name. Later in the 16th century it became an autonomous possession of the Spanish crown.
