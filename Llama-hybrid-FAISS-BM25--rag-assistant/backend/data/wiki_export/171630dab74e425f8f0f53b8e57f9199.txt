History
ST Engineering's history began with its precursor, the Chartered Industries of Singapore, which was established in 1967 by the newly independent Singaporean government as an ammunition manufacturer. Businesses related to aerospace and shipbuilding were later created and put under the ST umbrella. The ST group of companies went commercial in 1990, setting up its first commercial airframe manufacturing, repair and overhaul facilities in Singapore and the United States. ST Engineering was created in December 1997 as a merger of four listed companies: ST Aerospace, ST Electronics, ST Kinetics and ST Marine. Its shares debuted on the Singapore Exchange on 8 December 1997.

Since then, ST Engineering has grown to become one of Asia's largest defence and engineering groups for commercial and defence organisations across multiple industries. In Mar 2007, ST Engineering was ranked 19th in the aerospace & defence industry and 1,661th of 2,000 of the world's largest public companies by Forbes.
