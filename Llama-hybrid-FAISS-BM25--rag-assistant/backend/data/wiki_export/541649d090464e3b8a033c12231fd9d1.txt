Synopsis
The two sharpest weapons in the world,
The Rain-Ceasing Sword and the Cloud Ruling Sabre!
Carry the burdens of ethnic conflicts.

Pong Ban (Derek Kok) mercilessly defeated three monks who protected the Rain-Ceasing Sword. The surviving monk took the sword and fled when Long Fan-Wan (David Chiang) arrives to stop Pong Ban. The monk then was later found by Hon Pak (Bosco Wong), who presented it to Yin Wong.

It is set during the early Ming Dynasty, after the overthrow of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. Fung Heng-Lit (Raymond Lam), the Mongol prince, lost his childhood memories during a massacre by Emperor Zhu. Heng-Lit escaped the massacre and grew up in China, where he becomes the chief of a clan. Pong Ban tries, by all means, to regain Heng-Lit's childhood memory and groom him into being a prince, hoping that Heng-Lit may lead the Mongol rebels in a campaign to overthrow the Ming Dynasty. However, Heng-Lit has his own dream, in which the Mongols and the Han Chinese live together in harmony.
