Meltdown is the second release and first full-length album by American musician Steve Taylor. It followed 1983's I Want to Be a Clone and featured a similar kind of style, involving Christian rock incorporating new wave musical influences, while also being produced by Jonathan David Brown. The album did well, commercially, reaching the No. 10 spot on Billboard's Top Contemporary Christian chart.

It additionally received positive critical reviews from publications such as Billboard, saying that "Taylor has an edge and vitality". The album was listed at No. 18 in the 2001 book CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music. Like other works by Taylor, the album's songs touch on many socio-political issues; "We Don't Need No Colour Code" denounces Christian organizations that practice racism while "Over My Dead Body" calls for more attention to violations of human rights overseas.

Song references
The title track alludes to the famous attraction of Madame Tussauds, a wax museum in London, England.

"Baby Doe" was a vocal response to the early 1980 incidents involving the deaths of handicapped newborns that resulted from the withholding of medical treatment. The lyrics go beyond specific criticism to the individuals directly involved in those cases to condemning societal indifference and callousness in general, having lyrics about how "lawyers are bought" and the "presses have run". Taylor later remarked, "I don't like the idea of me just pointing the finger. In the song 'Baby Doe,' I was just as much to blame as the parents, because I wasn't doing anything about it."

"We Don't Need No Colour Code" challenged and ridiculed the racial policies of Bob Jones University, among other institutions. In its style, Taylor intentionally used musical references to African-American musician Bo Diddley. More recently, Taylor has explained that he finds joy in the song given the success of anti-racist efforts worldwide over the years.

"Guilty By Association" condemns evangelists that abuse Christian teachings and just seek fame and money for themselves.

"Over My Dead Body" called for more attention to be given to international violations of human rights.
