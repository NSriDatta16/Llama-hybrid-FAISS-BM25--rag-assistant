News and Tributes is the second full-length album by The Futureheads, released on 29 May 2006. The first single "Skip to the End" was released on 15 May 2006. The album, like their debut, received critical acclaim, and praise that the Futureheads had 'matured' their sound. However unlike their debut it did not sell very well, and led to the band being dumped by their label 679 Recordings.

With this album The Futureheads garnered comparisons to Blur, and particularly the album Modern Life Is Rubbish. It was produced by Ben Hillier, who has also produced for Blur and Depeche Mode. Singer/lyricist/guitarist Barry Hyde has revealed recently that second single "Worry About It Later" concerns "...modern attitudes towards casual sex".

The song "News and Tributes" is dedicated to the victims of the Munich air disaster, when a plane with many Manchester United players on board crashed in Munich in 1958.

The US edition of the album contains the four tracks only available on the Area EP, "Area", "Help Us Out", "We Cannot Lose" and the Shy Child remix of "Decent Days And Nights".
