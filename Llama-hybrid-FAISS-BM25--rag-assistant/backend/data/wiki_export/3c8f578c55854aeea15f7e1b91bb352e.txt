Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957, the full title of which is Convention concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957 (No. 105), is one of the eight ILO fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, which cancels certain forms of forced labour still allowed under the Forced Labour Convention of 1930, such as punishment for strikes and as a punishment for holding certain political views.

In order to implement the 1930 Forced Labour Convention and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, the Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour was set up.

Ratifications
, the Convention has been ratified by 178 of the 187 ILO members. Nine ILO members have not ratified the Convention:

Brunei
East Timor
Laos
Marshall Islands
Myanmar
Palau
South Korea
Tonga
Tuvalu

Two countries that had ratified the Convention (Malaysia and Singapore) have since denounced it. In addition, seven members of the United Nations are not members of the ILO and thus are not eligible to ratify the Convention unless they first join the ILO: Andorra, Bhutan, Liechtenstein, Micronesia, Monaco, Nauru, and North Korea.
