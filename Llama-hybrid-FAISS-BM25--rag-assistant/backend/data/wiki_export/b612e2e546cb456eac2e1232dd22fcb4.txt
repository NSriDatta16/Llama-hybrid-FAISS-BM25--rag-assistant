On May 12, 2006, at the age of 61, Commissioner Israel L. Gaither was formally installed as the National Commander of The Salvation Army in the United States, the first African American to serve in that capacity.  Gaither was selected for the position by General Shaw Clifton.

Eva D. Gaither, his wife, became President of the Salvation Army's Women's Ministries the same day, with executive responsibility for the advancement of women in developed and developing sectors of the world.  She had been World Secretary for Womenâ€™s Ministries in London since November 2002.

Prior to becoming Commander in the United States, Gaither was Chief of the Staff, the second-ranking officer at Salvation Army world headquarters in London.  He had held that office since November 2002.  He had also been the first Black divisional commander in the United States, with responsibility for southern New England and western Pennsylvania, and the first Black territorial commander, responsible for the Eastern states.  He had been commander of the Southern Africa territory as well.
