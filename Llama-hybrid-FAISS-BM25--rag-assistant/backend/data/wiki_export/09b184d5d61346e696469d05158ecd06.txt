History

Historic facility 
Hot Springs High School was built in 1914 by the now famed Sanguinet & Staats architectural firm as a large, Late Gothic Revival structure located near the center of Hot Springs. It was segregated in the school's early history, with African American students able to attend Langston High School starting in 1913.

Bill Clinton graduated in 1964. In 1988,  this school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

After Hot Springs High School moved to its current location on Emory Street in 1968, the old building was used as the Central Junior High until 1992. An earlier Hot Springs High School building was located at the same site on Oak Street. This structure burned in the fire of September 1913 that destroyed a large part of Hot Springs. In 2006, the historic facility was repurposed as 32 housing units for persons with disabilities, as the Hot Springs High School Lofts.
