The Wisconsin Collegiate Conference (WCC) is a collegiate athletic conference made up primarily of the branch campuses in the University of Wisconsin System as well as one private college. The teams currently compete in men's basketball and women's volleyball and formerly competed in co-ed soccer, women's basketball, men's tennis, and men's golf. All schools are considered junior colleges and athletes are only eligible for two years.

In 2020, after all schools suspended athletic events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the WCC went on hiatus. Ahead of the 2021–22 season, the satellite campuses of UW-Green Bay, UW-Oshkosh, and UW-Stevens Point formed a new conference, the Wisconsin Competitive Sports League. The WCC returned for the 2023–24 season, with only the Oshkosh, Stevens Point, Whitewater, and Platteville campuses returning (apart from Platteville's Richland campus, which closed in 2023). The only sports that returned were volleyball and men's basketball. Bryant & Stratton College's Wisconsin campuses also joined for men's basketball, becoming the first campus outside the UW System to join the conference.
