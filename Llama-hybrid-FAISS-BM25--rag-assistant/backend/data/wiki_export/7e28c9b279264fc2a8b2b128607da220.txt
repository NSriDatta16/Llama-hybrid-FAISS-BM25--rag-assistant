Violine is a Franco-Belgian comic book series, as well as the name of its main character, created by writer Didier "Tronchet" Vasseur and artist Fabrice Tarrin for Spirou magazine.

The series has been published in French, Dutch, and German (under the name Violetta), but not in English.

Synopsis
Violine is a young girl with a special power: a stare from her large violet eyes allows her to read one's thoughts and intentions. She lives in a mansion with her wealthy and domineering mother, who is somehow immune to this power. Her mother claims that Violine's father has died when she was three, but after finding evidence to the contrary, Violine embarks to Africa as a stowaway in search for him.

In the reboot, Le Troisième œil, there's been a time skip and Violine is now 16 years old.
