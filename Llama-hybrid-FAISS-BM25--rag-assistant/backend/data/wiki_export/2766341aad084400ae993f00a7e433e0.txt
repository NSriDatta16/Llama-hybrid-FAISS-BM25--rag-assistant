Eutelsat 16C (formerly SESAT 1) was a satellite operated by Eutelsat Communications, originally the first of a series of SESAT (Siberia - Europe SATellite) satellites. It provided a wide range of telecommunications services over a very large geographical coverage area that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Eastern Russia, including a large part of Siberia. The satellite also provided broadcasting services to Africa by means of steerable spotbeams.

On 29 January 2010, the satellite moved to 16Â° East to take over some services from the malfunctioning Eutelsat W2 satellite. The satellite was deactivated on 13 February 2018, after 17 years and 10 months of service, setting a record for in-orbit life.
