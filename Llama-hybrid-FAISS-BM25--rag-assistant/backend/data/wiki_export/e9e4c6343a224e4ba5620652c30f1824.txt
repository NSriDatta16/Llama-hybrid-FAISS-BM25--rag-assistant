Manhattan at the Bay
Since 1983, the Bay View Players of St. Mary Academy – Bay View have been performing a cabaret show at the school's annual Manhattan at the Bay event.  The show is the main attraction for this fundraising event, with all of the proceeds going directly to the school.  Over 100 St. Mary Academy – Bay View students participate in the performance as singers, dancers or members of the technical crew.  A small number of male students from local high schools supplement the cast. The show is directed by the school's Fine Arts faculty and supported by parent volunteers.  Students help build the sets and run the lighting and sound during the show.  Manhattan at the Bay includes six performances of the cabaret over one weekend, typically the last weekend of April or the first weekend of May.  In addition, supplemental fundraising events are held on campus throughout the weekend.

The Manhattan at the Bay cabaret production has contributed to St. Mary Academy – Bay View's reputation as one of the top theatre programs in the state.  Over the years, the Bay View Players have received numerous awards at the state Drama Festival.  They have performed at the Providence Performing Arts Center, the now-defunct Warwick Musical Theatre, and the American School in Paris.  The St. Mary Academy – Bay View Chamber Choir has also received considerable recognition: the group has performed in Italy and appeared as the backing choir for shows at the Providence Performing Arts Center, including the national tour of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and for singers Judy Collins and Clay Aiken.

In 2013, Manhattan at the Bay and the Bay View Players Cabaret celebrate the 30th Anniversary of Cabaret.
