The vestibular ganglion (also called Scarpa's ganglion) is a ganglion situated within the internal auditory meatus that lodges cell bodies of first-order sensory neurons of the vestibular nerve. The superior division and inferior division of the vestibular nerve meet at the ganglion; henceforth, the fibres of second-order neurons of the vestibular nerve merge with those of the cochlear nerve (whose first-order neurons have already synapsed at the spiral ganglion) to proceed towards the CNS as a single unified vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII).

Anatomy

Structure 
The ganglion contains the cell bodies of bipolar neurons whose peripheral processes form synaptic contact with hair cells of the vestibular sensory end organs. These include hair cells of the cristae ampullares of the semicircular duct, and the maculae of the utricle and saccule.

Development 
At birth, it is already close to its final size.

Etymology 
It is named for Antonio Scarpa.
