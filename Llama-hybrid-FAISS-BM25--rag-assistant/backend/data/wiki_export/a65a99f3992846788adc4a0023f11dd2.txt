Gordon Sherman Haight (6 February 1901 in Muskegon, Michigan – 28 December 1985 in Woodbridge, Connecticut) was an American professor of English at Yale University from 1950 to 1968. He was the author of George Eliot: A Biography and the editor of The George Eliot Letters.

"[Haight] was completely absorbed in the life and work of George Eliot and had the distinction, before he died, of being asked to speak at the dedication of her memorial in Westminster Abbey, an extraordinary recognition for an American, as I am sure you are aware!" ( from George F. Farr, Jr. Director, Division of Preservation and Access, National Endowment for the Humanities dated Mon, 27 Mar 1995)
