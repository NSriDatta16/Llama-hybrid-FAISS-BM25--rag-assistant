Pakistan Air Force Museum Faisal () is an Air Force museum and park situated near Karsaz Flyover on Shahrah-e-Faisal in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan.

A majority of the aircraft, weapons and radar are displayed outside in the park but the main museum features all major fighter aircraft that have been used by the Pakistan Air Force. The museum also houses the Vickers VC.1 Viking aircraft used by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, and a Folland Gnat of the Indian Air Force, that landed in Pasroor town, Pakistan in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. Also on display are the scale models of some World War I, World War II and some more modern aircraft and photo galleries of almost all the squadrons of Pakistan Air Force.

History 
The museum was established in 1990 in two unused hangars in a remote part of the Base. The museum was expanded significantly from its humble beginnings in the period 1999â€“2004. Additions include children's playing areas, rides, and eateries.

Management 
The museum is managed by a committee headed by the Air Officer Commanding Southern Air Command; however, it is managed and run by the Administrator. Recently the museum has been renamed as Historical Record & Archives Section and given additional responsibilities for maintaining some documented history of the PAF. The current Administrator of Museum is Air Commodore Syed Ali Zaidi. However, the museum was developed by Wing Commander Syed Salman Ahmed.
