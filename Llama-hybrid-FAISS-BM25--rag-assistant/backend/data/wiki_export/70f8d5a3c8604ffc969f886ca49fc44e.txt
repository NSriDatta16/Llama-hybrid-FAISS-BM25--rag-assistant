Guy Loraine Bond (May 4, 1904 – 1980) was an educational psychologist who made significant contributions to research in reading and literacy. Bond's work with Robert Dykstra on The First Grade Studies is perhaps the most famous of his contributions. His areas of study were reading, elementary education, and curriculum education psychology.

Born in Coupeville, Washington, Bond was educated at Western Washington State College and the Universities of Alabama and Columbia. Bond was a professor at State College, Fredonia, New York from 1936–1937. He was a professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Minnesota from 1942 to 1971, where an endowed faculty chair was established in his name.
