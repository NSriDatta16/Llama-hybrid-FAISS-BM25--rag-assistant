History

It is considered that next to the modern city was located the Cossack Fort "Tomakivka Sich" in the 16th century that was destroyed by Tatars soon after the Kosi≈Ñski Uprising.

During World War II, Marhanets was under German occupation from 17 August 1941 until 5 February 1944. It was administered as a part of Reichskommissariat Ukraine. The Germans operated a forced labour camp in the town.

On October 12, 2010, at least 42 people died in the Marhanets train accident.

Until 18 July 2020, Marhanets was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Marhanets Municipality. The municipality was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to seven. The area of Marhanets Municipality was merged into Nikopol Raion.
