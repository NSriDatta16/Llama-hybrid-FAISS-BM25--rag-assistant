"You've Got Another Thing Comin'" is a song by English heavy metal band Judas Priest. It was originally released on their 1982 album Screaming for Vengeance and released as a single later that year. In May 2006, VH1 ranked it fifth on their list of the 40 Greatest Metal Songs. It became one of Judas Priest's signature songs along with "Electric Eye" and "Breaking the Law", and a staple of the band's live performances. "You've Got Another Thing Comin'" was first performed on the opening concert of the Vengeance World Tour at the Stabler Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on 26 August 1982 and had been played a total of 673 times through the 2012 Epitaph Tour.

The song reached No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Judas Priest's only song to make that chart.

Background

Singer Rob Halford said the lyrics were about "Just this attitude that we've always had in Priest. And I dare say, we've always had in our personal way of dealing with issues that are sent to challenge us. ... It's also wrapped up in the heavy metal community culture of the way we support each other with our metal. It's very much a song of hope and rising above the issues or difficulties that come your way. It's a song of resilience, as well."

Charting
"You've Got Another Thing Comin'" has charted in two countries in the United Kingdom and in the United States. In the United Kingdom it peaked at No. 66 in the UK Singles Chart and in the US, it reached No. 4 on the Billboard rock chart.

Music video
The music video was directed by Julien Temple, and filmed at the Kempton Park Water Works. It features the band performing outside the pumping station among a background of lasers and smoke. Meanwhile, a higher authority figure arrives to shut the group down due to the noise level only to have his head blown off and its pants fell off towards the end of the video as a result of the exceeding force of Halford.

Reception
Wayne Parry of the Associated Press called it, along with "Hell Bent for Leather" and "Living After Midnight", one of the "standards against which other metal tracks are measured". Greg Prato of AllMusic wrote that the song was what finally broke Judas Priest into the mainstream in the United States.

According to Steve Huey, also of AllMusic, "You've Got Another Thing Comin'" is the band's signature tune.

In 2012, Loudwire ranked the song number nine on its list of the 10 greatest Judas Priest songs, and in 2019, Louder Sound ranked the song number four on its list of the 50 greatest Judas Priest songs.
