Koi Turnbull (sometimes credited as Coy Turnbull) is an American comic book artist, known for his work with DC Comics, Marvel, Aspen MLT's Fathom.

Early life and career
Coy Turnbull (the original spelling) was born on December 12th, in Elmhurst, Queens, New York. Most of his early years were spent in New York. When he was 13, Turnbull's family moved to Asheboro, North Carolina. There, he learned the ins and outs of the comic industry from working at a local comic shop with fellow future comic inker John "Waki" Wycough. Turnbull learned from the likes of local artist Randy Green and Rick Ketcham, who mentored him in preparation for a future in comics. In 1997, Turnbull moved back to New York to pursue a career in comics. His skills were noticed and he began work as a background artist on Marvel projects for Adam Pollian and Walter McDaniel.

In 2002, Turnbull's big break happened during the Wizard World Chicago Comic Convention, at a portfolio review with Aspen MLT's Frank Mastromauro (Executive Vice President) and Peter Steigerwald (Vice President of Publishing). The work caught their eyes, and a week after the con they contacted him about future employment with Aspen MLT.

After receiving the penciler job with Aspen MLT, Turnbull moved to Santa Monica, California to work in the Marina Del Rey studio. Working under the direction of Michael Turner, Turnbull's talent grew, and with that followed Turner's run on Fathom with his own run starting with Fathom Volume 2. Not feeling hindered by the large fan following of Turner's work, Turnbull was able to follow Mike's work with his own and bring his influence to the comic during his run. 

Following Turnbull's run on Fathom, he has since found work with DC Comics (working on Flash and Superman Confidential), Marvel Comics (Terror INC, New Warriors, Black Panther and One Month 2 Live storyline) and other comic projects.
