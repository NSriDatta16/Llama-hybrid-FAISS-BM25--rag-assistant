Professional wrestling career

Early career (1999–2003)
Davis got into wrestling after watching it with a friend who was a fan of Stone Cold Steve Austin. Davis initially became a fan of Sable. After researching how to get involved with the sport, Davis trained under Strawberry Fields, Leilani Kai, and Gary Royal at the Mid-Atlantic Wrestling Academy in Charlotte, North Carolina. After training for six months, she debuted in July 1999 in the Professional Girl Wrestling Association (PGWA) as Amber Holly, wrestling Leilani Kai in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. She also worked with Desiree Paterson and Riptide. In 2002, Holly began wrestling for the Carolina Wrestling Federation (CWF), where she furthered her training under Gemini Kid and Mikael Yamaha at the CWF Dojo Camp.

She tore her anterior cruciate ligament and patella tendon, as well as suffering cartilage damage. She was obliged to undergo reconstructive surgery and was inactive for approximately a year.

Team Blondage (2004–2005, 2009)
Holly returned to the ring on May 16, 2004, adopting the ring name Amber O'Neal and the gimmick of a motocross racer.

The team wrestled primarily on the North Carolina independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Shimmer and Women's Extreme Wrestling.
