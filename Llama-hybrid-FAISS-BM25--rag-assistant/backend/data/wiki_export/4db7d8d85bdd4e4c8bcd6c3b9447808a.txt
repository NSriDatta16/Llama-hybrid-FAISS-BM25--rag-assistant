The Barima River is a tributary of the Orinoco River, entering  from the Atlantic Ocean. It originates from the Imataka Mountains in Guyana, flowing for approximately  before entering Venezuela about  from its mouth.

Features
Early recorded explorations of the Barima were made by Robert Hermann Schomburgk, which was mapped as far as the tributary Rocky River.

The head of the Barima rises in a steep gorge of the Imataka mountains,  above sea level. Near the Duquari Creek, the Arawatta Rock, a distinct large granite rock, is located.

Settlements
Mabaruma, Koriabo, and Morawhanna are Barima-Waini Region communities on the Barima River.
