Sigma Gamma Chi () was a fraternal organization sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although it once was a national organization, it later only operated at the University of Utah.

History

Sigma Gamma Chi originated with Lambda Delta Sigma, a fraternity for Latter-day Saints founded in 1936 by Lowell L. Bennion, director of the University of Utah's Institute of Religion. Soon afterward it also admitted women into its membership. In 1967 the LDS Church assumed management and divided the organization, making Lambda Delta Sigma a sorority and creating Sigma Gamma Chi as its fraternity.

For decades the organization expanded and grew, creating new chapters within Sigma Gamma Chi and the sister organization Lambda Delta Sigma, and women outnumbered men 6 to 1. There were several charters at campuses throughout the United States. The fraternity's community service projects included repairs to the Jewish Community Center and creating Christmas baskets for the needy. It also sponsored dances and parties for young men to socialize with young women.

In 1978, Sigma Gamma Chi absorbed Delta Phi Kappa, the fraternity for returned missionaries. By 1999 it held 15,000 members in 105 chapters. In 2000, the fraternity was absorbed by the Institute Men's Association, a church organization for all Young Single Adults.

Church leadership eventually replaced Sigma Gamma Chi with the Latter-day Saint Student Association (LDSSA). In contrast to the fraternity's student elections, the LDSSA officers were church callings chosen by the presiding Institute of Religion director at the University of Utah. The student-run fraternity and sorority chapters were removed from the LDS Institutes of Religion. In the end, only the University of Utah was authorized to host Sigma Gamma Chi. However, its expansion was restricted because of a ban on new fraternity and sorority campus housing on Greek Row at the University of Utah, due in part to a Salt Lake City law passed in the 1980s.

As of 10 June 2011, Sigma Gamma Chi was no longer operating.

Organization
 
At the University of Utah, Sigma Gamma Chi (ΣΓΧ) was composed of twelve chapters (Alpha, Beta, Chi, Delta, Iota, Mu, Nu, Pi, Rho, Sigma, Phi, and Xi). Chapters typically met weekly on either Wednesday or Thursday night. These meetings were held at the LDS Institute of Religion to the South of The U of U campus (1780 E South Campus Drive). Sigma Gamma Chi was led by the Inter Chapter Council composed of a president and officers he selects from the twelve chapters. A chapter president led each chapter and assigned other officers from within the chapter. 

A new president of Sigma Gamma Chi was called annually to replace the previous president. Officer positions also included vice president, secretary, and pledge trainer. Pledges were required to learn the Greek alphabet.
