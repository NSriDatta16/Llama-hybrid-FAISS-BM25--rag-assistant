History
The Jetz entered the competition in 2004 in the place of the Manurewa Marlins. They finished a disappointing seventh and missed out on the playoffs. 2005 however was a better year with the team performing well, losing to eventual winners Mt Albert in the Preliminary Final. In 2006 they again made the playoffs but were eliminated by Tamaki in the first week. Before the 2007 season long serving head coach Gary Kemble announced his retirement to concentrate on business interests so former Northern Storm coach Geoff Morton was appointed for the season. The team's final season was its worst with it coming second to last.

2010: Zone

Following the Sparc review of the New Zealand Rugby League the new zonal competition was launched in 2010. Counties Manukau became a stand-alone zone with a team that was separate from Auckland.

Counties Manukau draws players from Mangere East, Howick, Pakuranga, Papakura, Franklin, Tuakau, Waiuku, Pukekohe, Papatoetoe, Otara, Manukau and Otahuhu.

In the 2010 season, Counties Manukau won the Under 15 and Under 17 tournaments but lost the final of the senior competition, being defeated by Auckland 14 – 6.
