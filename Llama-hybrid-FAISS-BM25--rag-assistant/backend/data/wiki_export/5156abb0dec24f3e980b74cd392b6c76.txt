Four Weddings is a British reality television series that premiered on Sky Living, on 6 July 2009. It has become popular enough to have inspired the creations of versions in other countries. One episode included the real-life wedding of Steps member Faye Tozer to her second husband Michael Smith.

The show ran for four series, running from 2009-2013. A planned revival series that was to be produced by ITV Studios subsidiary Multistory Media for Channel 4 was planned for 2023, but it was scrapped in May of that year for undisclosed reasons.

Format
The programme follows a similar style to Come Dine with Me, and involves four brides, or four grooms, attending each other's weddings and rating them on:

Dress (out of 10)
Venue (out of 10)
Food (out of 10)
Overall experience (out of 10)

At the end of the show, the four brides or grooms discover which of the couples has won a luxury honeymoon. Viewers could also play online in the "Online wedding rater" and rate the weddings as they were shown for comparison with the rest of the public.

 In the French version, since 2019, Ã‰lodie Villemus, a weeding planner, is there to observe and give ratings. Her ratings count for half of the final score.
