The Ribnica (, ) is a small river that runs through Podgorica, Montenegro.

It is a tributary to the river Morača, their confluence being at the city centre. It is mainly dried up in the summer. Podgorica was known as "Ribnica" after the Ribnica River in the Middle Ages. Today, an area of Podgorica, Vrela Ribnička, is named after the river, which flows through the area as well.
