Career

Modelling 

Chung was scouted after being seen in the comedy tent at the Reading Festival at the age of 16. She modelled for teen magazines, such as Elle Girl and CosmoGIRL!, and worked for companies including Fanta, Sony Ericsson, Sunsilk, Urban Outfitters, and Tampax. She appeared in music videos for artists including the Streets, Westlife, Delta Goodrem, Reuben and Holly Valance and starred as Jake in a scripted reality show called Shoot Me, broadcast on Fashion TV in 2005. After four years, Chung quit modelling with the intention of beginning an art foundation or fashion journalism course, having become disillusioned. She had developed a "distorted body image" and "low self-esteem" through modelling.

After she became a TV personality, Chung made a return to occasional modelling. In 2008, she was the face of Australian fashion label Antipodium's SS 2008 collection and Oxfam's ethical fashion range, Revamped.

Style 
Chung has been cited as a muse to many fashion designers because of her distinctive personal style. She frequently appears on best-dressed lists, is a regular model for Vogue, Elle and Harper's Bazaar and is often seen in the front row at fashion shows.

In January 2010, the designer handbag company Mulberry debuted the "Alexa," a popular bag named after and inspired by her. According to The Guardian, 380 "Alexa" bags were sold in one week alone in November 2010, and the company cited the bag's popularity for increased sales at its UK and international stores that year.

At the British Fashion Awards of 2011, 2012 and 2013, Chung won the British Style Award, for which the public voted. In 2015, Chung collaborated with AG Jeans on two collections.

Alexachung 
Chung launched her own fashion label, Alexachung, in May 2017. On its official website, the brand says its vision is "to create clothes that people want to wear. Combining Parisian chic with a New York edge, as well as the very British sense of humour, it is inspired by everything from Jane Birkin’s insouciance to David Hockney’s stripy sweater."

In March 2022 Chung announced the closure of the Alexachung brand, stating that "the last couple of years have been challenging for small independent businesses and ours is no exception."
