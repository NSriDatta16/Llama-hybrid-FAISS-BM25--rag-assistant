Sugar Mama was originally produced by the James O. Welch Company in 1965, as a companion candy to the already-produced Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddy.  

A Sugar Mama was a chocolate-covered caramel sucker, essentially a Sugar Daddy covered in chocolate. It had a distinctive red and yellow wrapper, the opposite of Sugar Daddy's yellow and red wrapper.

It has not been produced since the 1980s.
