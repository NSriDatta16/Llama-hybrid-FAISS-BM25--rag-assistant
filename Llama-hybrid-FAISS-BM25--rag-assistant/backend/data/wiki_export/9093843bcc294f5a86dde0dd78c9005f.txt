Personal life

Coulson has denied that she and French were romantically involved. In 1998 she commented, "Because our characters had an affair, they tried to make it a real life one and that was nonsense. He was a really good friend and we started on the show at the same time. Apparently two people of the opposite sex can't go out together without it being an affair, which is a shame".

Following her split from Chard in 1996, Coulson began dating Harry Harris, the brother of Patsy Palmer, who plays her daughter Bianca in EastEnders. She later went on to marry him in 2002.
