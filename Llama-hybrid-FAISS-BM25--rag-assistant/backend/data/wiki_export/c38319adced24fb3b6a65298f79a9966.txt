In addition to Engelberg, Wettingen, Gnadenthal and St. Blasien Abbeys also owned property in the village.  The village vogtei or bailiwick was an originally a Habsburg fief, though in the 14th century it transferred to the Schwendauer in Zürich.  Then, in 1438 it went to Bremgarten.

Between 1415 and 1798 the village belonged to the county of Baden.  During the short-lived Helvetic Republic it was part of the Canton of Baden from 1798 until 1803.
