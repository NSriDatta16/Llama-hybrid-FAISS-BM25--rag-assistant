Christopher Ironside OBE, FRBS (11 July 1913, London – 13 July 1992, Winchester, Hampshire) was an English painter and coin designer, particularly known for the reverse sides of the new British coins issued on decimalisation in 1971.

Life and career
Ironside began his career as a painter, studying at the Central School of Arts and Crafts. During World War II he served in the Directorate of Camouflage, working for the Air Ministry in Leamington Spa.

After the war he worked for the Ministry of Town and Country Planning, as Education Officer for the Council of Industrial Design, but gave up the post in 1948 due to increasing design commissions. His subsequent known work included: 1951 design contributions to the Festival of Britain, South Bank Exhibition; 1952 ballet stage and costume design with his brother for Sylvia, the revival production choreographed by Sir Frederick Ashton, first choreographed by Louis Merante to music by Leo Delibes in 1876; 1953 design for Pall Mall for the coronation of Elizabeth II; 1964 he collaborated with his brother Robin on the Shakespeare commemoration issue of stamps and first day covers. He taught part-time at the Royal College of Art from 1953 to 1963. His paintings were exhibited at two main shows, shared with his elder brother Robin, at the Redfern Gallery in 1944 and at Arthur Jeffress in 1960. He received an OBE in 1971.

Ironside designed various coins for the Royal Mint, including the reverse of the pre-2008 British 50 pence, ten pence, five pence, two pence, and one penny coins, as well as the former half penny coin. He designed coins for the Isle of Man, Singapore, Tanzania, Brunei, Qatar and Dubai.  He designed commemorative medallions including: the Britannia Commemorative Society's Medallion No.7 "The Spanish Armada" and No.42 "The Royal Navy"; the medal for the 1974 Centenary of Sir Winston Churchill's birth "This was Their Finest Hour"; the brass relief memorial for the Earl and Countess Mountbatten in Westminster Abbey; and, the brass relief for the 16th Duke of Norfolk in Arundel Castle (Fitzalan Chapel).

In 2013 the Royal Mint issued a 50 pence coin with one of his designs on the reverse to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth.

His collection of earlier concept sketches, plaster moulds and submission entries for the decimalisation competition are now housed in the British Museum.

He was married twice: to Janey Acheson (one daughter, the journalist and novelist Virginia Ironside); and, after that marriage was dissolved in 1961, to Jean Marsden (two daughters and one son).

Coins

Bahrain (1965) 
In the beginning of the 1960s, there was a proposal by the Royal Mint Advisory Committee for a joint currency for Bahrain, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai.  The committee had at this stage appointed Christopher Ironside on a term contract and asked him to provide prototype designs for these coins.  Three sets were prepared and presented, the first set depicted each denomination within its own geometric Arabic design which was favoured by the committee; the second set, which was a thematic set depicting a goitred gazelle (Arabian gazelle now extinct), a peregrine falcon, a local fish, a mosque, an Arab dhow, oil derricks, and a date palm; and, a third set of Arabic designs.  A file note, dated 24 February 1966, says: "The project for a common Gulf currency looks like being shelved for the time being and instead Qatar and Dubai are aiming to issue a joint currency in the near future."

The designs that were presented in the three sets were labelled as "Designs for Arabian Gulf coins", but were never taken further.

Tanzania (1966) 
After World War I, the territory of Tanganyika became a mandate territory of the United Kingdom and its monetary system was aligned to that of Kenya and Uganda, through the establishment of the East African Currency Board (EACB) in December 1919. Following independence, the decision to dissolve the EACB and to establish separate Central Banks in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda, the Bank of Tanzania Act, 1965, was passed by the National Assembly in December 1965, and the Bank was opened by the first President of Tanzania, Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere, on 14 June 1966.

Tanzania's first set of coins was issued in 1966, with a portrait of J. K. Nyerere on the obverse and African wildlife animals on the reverse.  This set included circulation and commemorative sets. The last circulation coins with this first portrait were dated 1984. All regular types with this portrait have the word "TANZANIA" and the date above the portrait and the Swahili words "RAIS WA KWANZA" (roughly meaning "First President") below.  Both the obverse and reverse were designed by Christopher Ironside.

Description
 5, 10, 20 and 50 Senti; 1 and 5 Shilingi denominations (1966; circulation up to cir. 1984).

These coins were struck as:
 5 senti in bronze, 4g, 22,5mm dia. 1966–1984 (170 Million coins minted), dodecagonal (12-sided). Design: Sailfish.
 10 senti in nickel-brass, 5g, 25mm dia. 1977–1984 (48M), scalloped. Design: Running zebra.

Qatar and Dubai (1966) 
In the beginning of the 1960s, there was a proposal by the Royal Mint Advisory Committee for a joint currency for Qatar and Dubai (the remaining Trucial States).  The committee had at this stage appointed Christopher Ironside on a term contract and asked him to provide prototype designs for these coins.  Three sets were prepared and presented, the first set depicted each denomination within its own geometric Arabic design which was favoured by the committee; the second set, which was a thematic set depicting a goitred gazelle (an Arabian gazelle now extinct), a peregrine falcon, a local fish, a mosque, an Arab dhow, oil derricks, and a date palm; and a third set of Arabic designs.

In the mid-1960s Qatar and Dubai entered a currency union and organised the design and production of their own coin set.  This joint currency was issued in 1966. The country names and denominations appear on the obverse, whilst a relatively simple design of a goitred gazelle adorns the reverse of all the coins (originally destined for the common currency to be used by Arab states of the Persian Gulf). The obverse and reverse of the coins were designed by Christopher Ironside.

Description
 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 Dirhams (A. 1386–1389/ AD.1966 – 1969); Qatar and Dubai.

These coins were struck as:

A total of 17 million coins were minted (individual mintage, in millions of coins, indicated in brackets above).

Brunei (1967) 
The Brunei Currency Board was established in 1967 and introduced the Brunei dollar as the new currency of Brunei, replacing the Malaya and British Borneo dollar after the Currency Union Agreement between Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei was terminated and all three countries issued their own currencies. The Brunei dollar was divided into 100 cents (or sen in Malay), with a portrait of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III on the obverse.  The reverses of the coins were designed by Christopher Ironside.

Description

 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 sen and dollar denominations.

These coins were struck as:

 1 sen in copper-plated zinc, 1g, 17mm dia.  (18,5M). Reverse design: representation of flower or blossom.

 A 10 dollar coin bearing a portrait of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III on the obverse, and dollar signs on the reverse was prepared by Ironside but was never taken into production.

Jamaica (1969) 
In 1968, the House of Representatives unanimously approved the report of the Select Committee of the House, which recommended that the currency of Jamaica should be decimalized in 1969. The introduction of a decimal currency provided the opportunity for the introduction of a complete Jamaican coinage as formerly, the coins (with the exception of the penny and halfpenny), were the same as those used in the United Kingdom. With regard to the design, it was decided that the portrait of the ruling British monarch, which had appeared on the obverse of all coins, would be replaced by the Jamaican coat of arms, with national symbols on the reverse depicting aspects of the island's flora and fauna, images that reflect the ideals of the newly independent country. The reverse of the decimal coinage was designed by Christopher Ironside.

Description
 1, 5, 10, 20 and 25 penny/cent denominations

These coins were struck as:
 1 cent in bronze, 4g, 21mm dia. 1969–1974 ( 65Million coins minted); Aluminium 1975–2002 (108M), only proofs cast after 1987.  Design: Ackee fruit, the national fruit.

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (1970) 

In the 1970s the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations initiated a panel of coins to "draw attention to the most important challenge of our time, that of providing food, training and work for a rapidly expanding world population".  These coins had two purposes, to serve as daily reminders, over the period of a generation, of the national and international efforts needed to meet the challenge of world food development, and to provide, through seigniorage as funds to help finance such development. People buying these FAO coin panels were thus making a personal contribution toward tackling the challenge set by the programme.

The 1970s FAO coin panel was the first international coin issue in monetary history.  There were 23 contributing designers from around the world, amongst them Stuart Devlin, William Gardner and Christopher Ironside.

Description

The complete set of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 1970 coin set was 45 coins, representing 33 countries. 10,000 numbered box sets were produced. The coins of the British Commonwealth had their reverse designed by Christopher Ironside.

These coins were struck as (Board 1):

Isle of Man (1970) 
Under the provision of the Manx Decimal Currency Act of 1970, a decimal series of coins for the Isle of Man were prepared and released on 20 October 1971 (½, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 new pence coins).  The reverse of most of these coins was designed by Christopher Ironside. This set had the same composition and size as the corresponding British coins.

These coins were struck as:

1971 first decimal set (issued from 1971 to 1974):

 ½ New penny, bronze; 2g, 17mm dia. (300,000 minted); reverse Cushag yellow field flower regarded as the national flower.

Gibraltar (1971) 
As a territory under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, Gibraltar decimalised its currency in the 1970s. In 1971 a 25 New Pence (1 Crown) coin was issued with a reverse design by Ironside of a Barbary macaque.

Description
 25 New Pence (= 1 Crown), copper-nickel, 38mm dia.; round, 1971 (75,000 minted by the Royal Mint; silver proofs, 20,000 minted).  Obverse design: Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin; reverse design: Barbary ape by Christopher Ironside.

Mauritius (1971–88) 
In 1971 a new set of coins and banknotes for Mauritius were introduced by the Royal Mint.  This set has Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and a range of heraldic motives on the reverse. Some of the reverse designs for this set were designed by Christopher Ironside.

These coins were struck as:

1971 Mauritius Independence Proof Set: Set of 9 coins in fitted case, 750 issued, comprising:
 200 rupees, gold, 27mm dia.; (2,500 minted); Obverse: Elizabeth II; reverse design courting couple by Christopher Ironside.

Malta (1972) 
As a country under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, Malta decimalised its currency in the 1970s. In May 1972 a new set of Maltese coins was issued. The Malta pound, which was renamed Maltese lira (Lm) in 1983, was retained as the currency unit.

The design rationale for the new coins was both to proclaim the country's independence and to feature the distinguished personalities, historical monuments and edifices, flora, fauna and folklore articles of Malta. These coins were designed by Christopher Ironside.

Description
Eight coins were issued in the following denominations: 2 mils, 3 mils, 5 mils, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents. The mils were in aluminium, the 1 cent in bronze, and the rest in cupro-nickel.

 2 mils in aluminium, 1g, 20,3mm dia., scalloped, 1972–1986 (100,000).  Obverse design: Maltese cross (reference to the Knights of St John and the occupation of Malta).

 3 mils in aluminium, 1,5g, 23mm dia., scalloped, 1972–1986 (71,000).  Obverse design: Maltese bee wings outspread over a honeycomb.  Historically the bee has long been the symbol of industry and hard work, while the honeycomb represents the manifestation of divine harmony in nature.

Kuwait (1976) 

Ironside designed the obverse of a Kuwaiti coin commemorating the 15th anniversary of the National Day of the State of Kuwait, which remained uncirculated. It was struck as:

 2 Dinars in 50% silver and 50% nickel (although some descriptions state 99% silver), 28g, 38mm dia. 1976 ( 70,00 minted; uncirculated).  Obverse carrying the profiles of Sheikh Abdullah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah, who was the last Sheikh and first Emir of Kuwait and who witnessed the independence of Kuwait, and his half-brother Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah who succeeded him and was Emir at the time the coin was struck; reverse depicting the gate of the old wall of Kuwait City; a dhows, a traditional sailing boat used throughout the region; and, an oil derrick, the main source of wealth for the country.
 Christopher Ironside designed the obverse, while the reverse is not documented.

Singapore (1985) 
Singapore's second series of coins, designed by Ironside in about 1981, and put into circulation in 1985, were known as the Floral Series. The design brief was to highlight the botanical diversity of Singapore as part of a government effort to foster national pride and identity. The Vanda 'Miss Joaquim' orchid was chosen as the country's national flower in 1981.

Description
 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent, 1 dollar denominations (design cir. 1980; circulation 1985 – current).
 The obverse design bears the Singapore Arms in the centre surrounded by the word "SINGAPORE" in the four official languages around the circumference of the coins. The year-date is below the Singapore Arms.

These coins were struck as:
 1 cent in bronze, 2g, 18mm dia. 1985–1990; copper-plated zinc 1992– current (636M). Stopped minting in 2002.  Shows Singapore's national flower, Vanda Miss Joaquim.

 1 dollar in aluminium-bronze, 6g, 22mm dia. 28th Sept 1987– current (660M). Stopped minting 2006.  Shows periwinkle (Lochnera rosea).

There is a possibility that the original design work is stored in the National Archives, Kew.
