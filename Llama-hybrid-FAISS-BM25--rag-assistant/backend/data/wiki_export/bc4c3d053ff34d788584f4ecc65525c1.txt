History

The origins of Borgetto are disputed. The two largely accepted theories are that Borgetto was set up as vantage point over the Mediterranean Sea by Arab invaders. Thus, comes the root of Borgetto, Burj, which translates to tower in Arabic. Borgetto is the combination of Burj (tower) and -etto (a suffix meaning small in Italian).

The other theory is that Borgetto was set up by the Greeks as Greek ruins are commonplace throughout Sicily. This theory, however, is based on theory as opposed to fact.
