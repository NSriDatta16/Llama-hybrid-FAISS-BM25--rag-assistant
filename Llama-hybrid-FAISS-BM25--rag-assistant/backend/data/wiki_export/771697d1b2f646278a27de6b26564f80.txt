Koch is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken by the Koch people of India and Bangladesh. It is primarily spoken in the Indian states of Meghalaya, West Bengal, and Lower Assam and in the parts of the country Bangladesh, where it serves as a major means of communication among the Koches (including Koch-Rajbongshi) and other ethnic groups in the region. Koch language is written with Assamese, Bengali, Roman scripts.

There is an organization Koch Krorang Mathop in Tura, Meghalaya which publishes Koch materials, such as books, an annual Koch magazine. Koch Development Forum is also working on the promotion of the Koch language among the Koch people who have now switched their language to Indo-Aryan languages.
