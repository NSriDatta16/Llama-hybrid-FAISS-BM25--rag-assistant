Dai Bai Zan Cho Bo Zen Ji was founded by Zen Master Genki Takabayashi in 1983. Genjo Marinello Oshō succeeded Genki Rōshi in 1999 as the second abbot of Chobo-ji.

Genki Takabayashi 

Genki Takabayashi Rōshi was invited by the Seattle Zen Center (founded by Dr. Glenn Webb, at the time a University of Washington Art History professor) to become the resident teacher in the fall of 1978. He accepted, and by 1983 founded Cho Bo Zen Ji.  In Japan, he trained for nearly twenty years at Daitoku-ji, one of two parent Rinzai school temples. Takabayashi also directed a Rinzai temple in Kamakura.  He became a monk at age 11. In 1997, Takabayashi retired and moved to Montana. Genki died on February 25, 2013, at his home in Montana, at the age of 81.
