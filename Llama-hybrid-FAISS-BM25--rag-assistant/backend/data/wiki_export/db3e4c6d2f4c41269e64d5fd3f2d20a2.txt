Pont Reading is an historic, American home that is located in the Ardmore section of Haverford Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It was the residence of shipbuilder and architect Joshua Humphreys; he lived here his entire life. It was named after his family's homestead, Reading Pont in Wales.

This house, which is currently a private residence, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History and architectural features
Humphreys was most notable for his design of the famous USS Constitution, or "Old Ironsides". The home, now stuccoed, was originally built in 1730, using stone around a log cabin that dated to 1683. The rear kitchen wing was added in 1813. The building is an excellent example of upper-class colonial architecture.

The house, which is a private residence, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In March 2007, Cookie Magazine published an article titled "To the Manor Born" about the house and its owners. The article included internal photographs. The house's owners since 2003 (Chris DeWitt/Oscar Yague) oversaw major restoration to maintain the property.
