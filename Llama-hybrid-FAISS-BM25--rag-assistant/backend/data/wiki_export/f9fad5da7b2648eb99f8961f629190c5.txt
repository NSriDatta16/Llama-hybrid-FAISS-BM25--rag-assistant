The Amboy Dukes is the debut studio album by American rock band The Amboy Dukes.  It was released in November 1967 on Mainstream Records.

Composition

The album is noted for containing an energetic recording of Joe Williams' blues standard "Baby, Please Don't Go", as well as covers of Pete Townshend's composition "It's Not True", and Cream's "I Feel Free". AllMusic said that the album fused "the psychedelia of the early Blues Magoos with Hendrix riffs and British pop" and described the song "Colors" as psychedelic hard rock. The publication compared "Down on Philips Escalator" to Syd Barrett-period Pink Floyd, and said that "The Lovely Lady" "almost sounds like the Velvet Underground meets the Small Faces by way of Peanut Butter Conspiracy."

Reception

"Baby, Please Don't Go" was released as a single, with the song "Psalms of Aftermath" as the B-side. Ultimate Classic Rock said that the album received "little, if any, fanfare outside of [the band's] home base of Detroit". AllMusic wrote in a retrospective review that the album is "as essential to the Amboy Dukes' catalog as the non-hit material on Psychedelic Lollipop was to the Blues Magoos, the first album from the Amboy Dukes is a real find and fun listening experience. [...] This is a far cry from Cat Scratch Fever, and that's why fans of psychedelia and '60s music should cherish this early diamond."
