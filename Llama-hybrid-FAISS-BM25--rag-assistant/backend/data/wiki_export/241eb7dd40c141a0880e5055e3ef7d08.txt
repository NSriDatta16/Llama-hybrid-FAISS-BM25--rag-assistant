The Lost Riots is the debut album by Chichester-based rock band Hope of the States, released on 7 June 2004 in the United Kingdom, on 1 September 2004 in Japan, and on 5 October 2004 in the United States. The album was recorded at studios in Ireland and England, and thought to be recorded partly in Russia, before the finishing touches were put together at Real World Studios in Bath. Guitarist James "Jimmi" Lawrence committed suicide during the mixing of the album in January 2004.

The Lost Riots was bolstered by the release of several singles: "Black Dollar Bills" in March 2003 and "Enemies/Friends" in September 2003, which peaked at numbers 83 and 25, respectively, on the UK Singles Chart, while "The Red the White the Black the Blue" gave the band their highest charting single when it peaked at number 15 in the UK and number 22 in Scotland upon release in May 2004. A fourth single, "Nehemiah", was released in August 2004 and peaked at number 30 in the UK. All four singles were accompanied by promotional music videos, directed by creative design collective Type2error.

Released to mostly enthusiastic critical acclaim upon release, reviewers praised the band's balance of intense post-rock bombast and anthemic post-Britpop dynamics, while criticism was directed at lead singer Samuel Herlihy's lack of vocal range and the band's dour sound. The album charted at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart.

Track listing

After "1776" ends and a period of roughly five minutes of silence, the hidden track "A Crack-Up at the Race Riots" can be found. The name of the song is based on a book by Harmony Korine, and for legal reasons, the band couldn't include it as a proper track. The total length of track 12 with both songs and silence is 14:53.

The total length for track 14 on the Japanese CD release is 17:18.
