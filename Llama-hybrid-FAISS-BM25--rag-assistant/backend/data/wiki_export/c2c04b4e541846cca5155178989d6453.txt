Kenneth Bousfield (2 October 1919 – 25 May 2000) was one of the leading British golfers of the immediate post-World War II period.

Bousfield won a number of tournaments on the European circuit in the 1950s and 1960s, including the British PGA Championship, which is the second most prestigious tournament in the United Kingdom after The Open Championship. He had two top ten finishes at The Open Championship, finishing in a tie for fifth in 1955 and a tie for eighth in 1961. He was past his peak by the time the formal European Tour was formed in 1972, but he played on it until 1976. He played for Great Britain in the Ryder Cup six times (1949, 1951, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961) and had a 5-5-0 win–loss–draw record.
