Seftigen District is one of the 26 administrative districts in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland. Its capital, while having administrative power, was the municipality of Seftigen.

From 1 January 2010, the district lost its administrative power while seeing its constituent municipalities being divided and partly resettled in the Bern-Mittelland (administrative district), whose administrative centre is Ostermundingen but also in the Thun (administrative district), whose administrative centre being Thun.

The district has an area of 189 km² and consists of 25 municipalities:
