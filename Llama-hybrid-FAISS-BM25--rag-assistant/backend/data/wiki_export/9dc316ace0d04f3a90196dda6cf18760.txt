History and application

Cossacks
As a unit of the Cossack regiments, it is known from the earliest records of the Zaporizhian Sich.

During the Cossack service in the Imperial Russian Armies the typical regiment had five  or squadrons. The term was used in the context of Cossack foot or cavalry regiments. The unit term was retained until the establishment of Soviet Union in 1922 and termination of the Ukrainian People's Republic and Free Don Cossack Oblast.

Established by the Cossacks the word Kurin was being associated in their military dictionary. By the Second World War the word burin was commonly used alongside Sotnia. It was a term referring to the basic combat unit of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), the world Kurin means a village. These villages were equivalent to a battalion around four to eight hundred member each divided into three to four sotnias.

Cossacks: Don Cossacks
In 1906, Russia faced eighteen months of revolutionary turmoil. The Cossacks played a large role in becoming one of the most feared defenders. Discontent steadily merged late that summer, causing an increase in unrest for workers and peasants within the Russian Empire. Between May and August, fifteen Don Cossacks units mutinied.

Cossacks of the second Sotnia carried out a large group of numbers in meetings to avoid dispersing the mob. Several meetings were made and a report was made listing other incidents of the same regiment. Concluding that all the Cossacks of the Taganrog have been seen as unreliable.

Cossacks started an internal police service. They depicted themselves a heroic warriors and defender of the fatherland. The group carried out many terrorist operations. Cossacks would break up in smaller units, referring to half-sotnias. They used campaigns that were unparalleled in its brutality and scope, the morale of the Cossacks became to decrease.

Every  usually had one light machine gun, two or three other special weapons, and at least seven assault rifles.

Nebesna Sotnia (Heavenly Hundred) 
In the wake of the 2014 invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which killed around 20,000 Ukrainians, the Ukrainian heroes became known as the “Heavenly Hundred” (Ukrainian: Nebesna Sotnia). Nebesna being defined as heavenly, in the sense that there is a link with Heaven or God. Sotnia defined as hundreds, refers back to the military units established by Cossacks. Heavenly Hundred can be understood as the “legion of those who went to heaven” or “the legion of those who went to God”.

Fall of 2013, Ukraine marked the day 20 February around the world, the Day of Commemoration of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. Ukrainians protested on the streets against the corrupt authoritarian regime of Viktor Yanukovych, who was the former president. This was a movement that soon became names as the Revolution of Dignity. Ukrainians in all cities and town came together to ruse up in defence of their inalienable rights. Wanting a new rule of law and democracy for the country/ Demanding the government to produce them with both dignity and human rights that they all deserve 

Throughout the years, everyone from around the world are reminded of the principles and values which the Ukrainians had to pay for and continue to pay with their own lives, dignity, democracy, equality and rule of the law. The Revolution of Dignity, has become a turning point in modern Ukraine history, it has now become recognised throughout the world as expression of the ideal of national freedom.

Zhinocha Sotnia (Women's Squad)
Between 2013 and 2014 Ukrainian women and males were able to both equally participate at Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti protesting for their rights. However, women were excluded from the more violent activities, where their contributions became largely unknowable. By 2014, Nadia Parfan organised and created a “Night of Women’s Solidarity” leading a group of feminists to Maidan. Dissatisfaction grew amongst the women protest and the continued exclusion for the Maiden square grew a new phenomenon known as the “Women's Squad” (Zhinocha Sotnia), an all-women self-defense brigade. The translation is “Women's Hundred”, this use of “hundred” is referred to a common grouping of soldiers into squads of hundred.

Women would protest feminist initiatives and discussions about their role in Ukraine’s past and future, which explored both nationalism and military contexts. The Maidan created a place where women were able to protest and be heard in a public space. Provided Ukraine’s feminists with brand new opportunities to articulate divergent and familiar outlooks on women's lives through activism, social change and national sovereignty.
