SK Dynamo České Budějovice is a football club from České Budějovice, Czech Republic. They currently play in the Czech First League, the first tier of football in the Czech Republic.

History
The club was founded in 1899 as Sportovní kroužek České Budějovice and in 1900 as Sportovní klub České Budějovice. Since 1993, the club has played in the top-level Czech First League almost exclusively. Despite suffering relegation three times, most recently in 2005, the club has won promotion back to the top-flight immediately on each occasion.

In 2002 České Budějovice celebrated promotion to the Czech First League, announcing a project to reconstruct their stadium in line with league requirements. The club celebrated its centenary in 2005 but were relegated from the top flight, vowing to return to the Czech First League a year later. In the 2005–06 Czech 2. Liga, the club started poorly, lying in 13th place in late September. A change in fortunes came about with the club signing former player and all-time leader in national team appearances Karel Poborský on loan from Sparta Prague. The club improved significantly and went on to win promotion back to the Czech First League at the end of the season.

Since 2011, České Budějovice have had an agreement where SK Strakonice 1908 operates as its farm team.

In 2023, sports researchers Michal Průcha and Zdeněk Zuntych found out from an edition of the then České Budějovice local newspaper "Budivoj" that the football club was founded in 1900. In response, the team changed the year in its logo.
