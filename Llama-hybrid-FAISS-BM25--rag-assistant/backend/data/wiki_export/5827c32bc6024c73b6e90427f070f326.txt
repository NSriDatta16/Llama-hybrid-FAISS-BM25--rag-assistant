History
Edingen and Neckarhausen have been settled since the time of the Celts, because of the mild climate and fertile soil.

Edingen
Edingen was first mentioned in the Lorsch codex on 17 November 765 in a grant document of the Lorsch Abbey, in which the village was granted to Lopodonum (today Ladenburg). The manor of Edingen belonged to the Imperial Abbey of Lorsch and the Bishopric of Worms. At the end of the 12th century, the count palatine took over lordship of the town until 1802.

Neckarhausen

Shortly after Edingen, Neckarhausen was mentioned in the Lorsch codex for the first time on 26 June 773. Between the end of the 14th century and 1705, the Bishopric of Worms and the counts Palatine shared lordship over the town. Afterwards, lordship fell to the Palatinate alone.

After court of the Electors Palantine moved away from Mannheim to Munich in the year 1778, the secret state and conference minister, Franz Albert Freiherr von Oberndorff (1720–1799) became governor for the prince-elector Karl Theodor in Mannheim. As part of his reward, he was raised to a count (Graf) in 1790. Neckarhausen became the family seat of the young dynasty. Before the village are the clan holdings.

The last of the Oberndorff line to live at Neckarhausen, Count Alfred von Oberndorff (1870–1963), was German ambassador in Oslo, Sofia, and Warsaw, and was representative of the foreign office in the armistice negotiations in November 1918 in Compiègne. They are both buried in the local graveyard.
