The Vanoise Express is a French double-decker cable car that links La Plagne with Les Arcs ski resorts in the Alps, acting as a vital link in the Paradiski area.

Ordered by Compagnie des Alpes and built by Poma in time for the '03-'04 season, the lift stretches ,  over the valley, takes 4 minutes to cross, and cost over 15 million Euro to complete. It was officially opened in December 2003. It has a capacity of over 200 people. It is not a conventional cable car.  The two units can operate separately and have individual spare engines. The lift operates without any supporting pylons.

As a result of safety inspections in December 2007, the operators announced that this lift would remain shut for the entire 2007/2008 season as repairs could not be undertaken until the spring. This closure effectively shut down Paradiski for that season. It opened up again for 2008–09.
