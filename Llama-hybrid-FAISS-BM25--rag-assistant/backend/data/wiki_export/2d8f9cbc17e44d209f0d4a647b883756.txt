This is a list of universities in Vietnam. The public higher education system in Vietnam basically consists of 2 levels: university system (called đại học) and university (usually specialize in a fixed scientific field; called trường đại học). University systems in Vietnam consist of many member institutions, with each institution equivalent to a regular specialized university. In addition, in Vietnam, there are private universities operating under the management of the Ministry of Education and Training (in terms of expertise) and private enterprises (in terms of operation and management). Private universities in Vietnam are usually multidisciplinary universities, but in terms of decentralization in the education system, these private universities are only equivalent to a public specialized university.

All universities in Vietnam are managed by a corresponding central authority, most of which are managed by the Ministry of Education and Training. Some are managed by ministries and other government organizations such as the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Health, the Vietnam Women's Union, etc. However, these organizations only manage professional issues (consultations). specialized knowledge), and remains in consultation with the Ministry of Education. As for the private universities, all are under the management of the Ministry of Education.

The current Vietnamese government also maintains a national key university policy. This is a list of universities with high achievements and training quality, classified according to the scientific fields that the university offers. These universities will receive more benefits in operation and management, for example: priority to receive support packages to build training programs and facilities, approve projects to open new majors and education programs, being able to educate and self-award a doctoral degree without first approval from the Ministry of Education and Training.

University systems 
Vietnam currently exists 6 university systems (đại học), each university system divided into many member universities or constituent colleges (trường đại học), member schools (trường or khoa) or member institutes (viện) specializing in training and researching a specific group of disciplines to create their own strengths. The head of a university is called a director, and the head of a member university is called a rector. All 6 university systems are in the group of national key universities.

National universities 
Vietnam National University (VNU; Đại học Quốc gia) is a special hierarchy of the Vietnamese higher education system. VNUs are not under the management of the Ministry of Education or any other organization, but operate completely independently, only under the control of the Prime Minister of Vietnam.

Currently, there are only two VNUs in the two largest municipalities of Vietnam, Vietnam National University, Hanoi and Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City.

Regional universities 
Regional universities (đại học vùng) are university systems under the management of the Ministry of Education and Training. Their organization and operation are similar to VNUs, but the directors will work with the Minister of MOET instead of the Prime Minister. Can Tho University is completing the project of upgrading to the fourth regional university.

Specialized university systems 
On December 5, 2022, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 1512/QD-TTg on the transformation of Trường Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội into Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội. Accordingly, Hanoi University of Science and Technology became the sixth university system in Vietnam.

Currently, some universities such as National Economics University, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City are preparing projects to become university systems, and are waiting for the approval of  Ministry of Education and Training.

The Vietnamese government does not interfere in the operation of the school, however, it has the right to ask the directors to explain their management activities to ensure compliance with the provisions of Vietnamese law. Normally, these universities have the right to enroll students by separate methods, independent of the general regulations of the Vietnamese Ministry of Education.
