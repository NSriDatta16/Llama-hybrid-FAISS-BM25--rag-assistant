History 

Metuchen station opened on July 11, 1836 with the completion of the New Jersey Railroad to East Brunswick (location of modern-day Highland Park). The railroad built a station depot at Main Street by 1850. When the Lehigh Valley Railroad opened their line in the 1870s, the Pennsylvania Railroad moved Metuchen station to the Lake Avenue crossing to provide connection to the new railroad. The railroad moved Metuchen station one last time, to the current location in 1888. A secondary station in Metuchen existed from 1879 to 1911 known as Robinvale. Robinvale station burned twice: once on February 28, 1915,  and once on March 27, 1915. Amtrak serviced Metuchen station from its inception on May 1, 1971 until October 26, 1975.
