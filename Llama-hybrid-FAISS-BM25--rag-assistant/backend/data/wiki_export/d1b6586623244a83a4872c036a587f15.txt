Yuval () is a Hebrew first name. It means stream, brook, or tributary. In the Hebrew Bible, Yuval (also Jubal) was the son of Lamech and Adah, a brother of Jabal, a descendant of Cain. He was named as the ancestor of all who played the lyre and pipe (see book of Genesis 4:20-21).
Yuval is known as the father of music.

In Israel, Yuval (Yooval or Uval) is a common male and female name. While the name has Biblical origins, it does not have a strong religious connotation.
