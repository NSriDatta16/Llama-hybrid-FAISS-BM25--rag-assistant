Guru's Jazzmatazz: Streetsoul is the third solo studio album by American hip hop musician Guru. It was released on October 3, 2000, via Virgin Records as the third installment of Guru's Jazzmatazz album series. Production was handled by Gang Starr, The Neptunes, Agallah, DJ Scratch, Erykah Badu, J Dilla, The Roots and Victor Flowers.

Synopsis 
As the title seems to suggest, this volume featured a blend of soul with R&B. The decline in jazz inflections that made Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1 popular continued on this release (the decline was already noticeable on Jazzmatazz, Vol. 2: The New Reality). According to Billboard's music charts, any aspersions levied by music critics against the album had little (if any) impact on its performance in the marketplace. Streetsoul outperformed previous entries significantly; it peaked at #32 and #8 on the Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts respectively.

As with previous releases, a host of guest performers were featured on this recording. Most of the artists are stalwarts of the neo soul and R&B scene. First-time appearances in the series were made by several contemporary acts, including Amel Larrieux, Angie Stone, Bilal, Craig David, Donell Jones, Erykah Badu, and The Roots. Veterans featured on this release include Herbie Hancock and Isaac Hayes.
