Summary
In the 'Era of the Warring States', Emperor Moosunje has gotten his hands on a powerful sword, known as the PaChun. The PaChun absorbs the blood of humans and gives its wielder amazing power rival only... to the power of its counterpart- the PaSa. The owner of the PaSa, Rey Yan, is, unknowingly, part of a plot devised by the demonic Prime Minister Shiyan and his brother to overthrow the Demon Emperor, lest he becomes the Grand Emperor of Heavenly Destruction and gains control over all three realms. After Emperor Moosunje proves incapable of controlling the PaChun, Prime Minister Shiyan kidnaps Jaryoon, King of Hahyun to receive the sword. Jaryoon, normally a kind and just leader, is transformed into a monster whose mission it is to conquer and 'unite' all the neighboring kingdoms and make Rey Yan suffer.

Characters

Realms
Human realm: The realm where all the humans live. It separates the Divine Realm and the Demon Realm and thus has beings from both interacting with humans.
Divine realm: The realm where all the gods and demi-gods live.  In the last 500 years, it was changed from a paradise to a land of blood by the Second Son.
Demon realm: The realm where all the demons live.  A brutal land where only the strongest survive.

History 
As orphans, Rey and his sister had been living in the streets as young children, and one day decided to go to the palace to meet the emperor, hoping that he would be able to help them. When they arrived, they were each given a sword, and sent into a deep dungeon-like pit where many other orphans were also trapped. The steep walls were unclimbable, and all of the children starved there for several weeks, with only each other and a sword for company. After a long time, the top of the pit slid open, and two large barrels of food were dumped down into the pit. This, of course, was not nearly enough to feed all of the starving children, and they soon realized the truth: They would have to kill each other for the food. Rey's sister was "lost to the darkness", and Rey fell into a deep, exhausted coma, waking to find a demon stone implanted on his forehead because he was one of the strongest who survived.

How he got out and met Shyao is unclear, but they were taken in by a master who taught them of the arts of fighting, magically and physically. However, the powerful demon White Tiger destroyed their master, and Rey vowed revenge. Before dying, their master entrusted the PaSa sword to Rey, telling him to use it wisely. However, as the sword became part of Rey, so did its longings. Thus, in order for the PaSa sword to maintain its tremendous power, it must be constantly fueled by demon blood, thus Rey must continue killing if he hopes to escape the wrath of the heavenly soldiers and sages, and also to protect himself from the PaSa sword's rival and companion, the PaChun sword.

Although Rey's raw power is rather remarkable by human standards, his swordsmanship (and most importantly, learning to merge with the PaSa sword's spirit) leave much to be desired. Master Chen Kaihu takes him in as his disciple (having failed to lure Kuochien away from the ladies long enough). The sword spirit, however, does not find the idea of Rey learning to control his power too exciting as this means he will have a harder time possessing him.
