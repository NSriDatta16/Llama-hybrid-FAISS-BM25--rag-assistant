Ulcinj Municipality (Montenegrin: Opština Ulcinj / Општина Улцињ; Albanian: Komuna e Ulqinit; Turkish: Ülgün Belediyesi) is the southernmost municipality of Montenegro, bordered by Albania to the east, Bar Municipality to the north and Adriatic Sea to the south and the west. It has an area of 255 km², and a population of 19,921 as of the 2011 census. Its seat is the town of Ulcinj.

Geography and tourism
On a hilltop overlooking the shore, Ulcinj is a popular tourist destination for its Long Beach, Valdanos, Lake Šas, and Ada Bojana Island, and for its 2000-year-old Ulcinj Castle. There is also a beach called Mala Plaža (also "the City beach") which is much smaller, but is located in the centre of town and very popular with visitors.

"The Korzo", as it is called by locals, is a promenade which separates a street lined with coffee shops from Mala Plaža. On summer nights, the Korzo is closed to car traffic, and families and young people gather there. Many lesser-known smaller beaches are also near the main tourist areas.

Ulcinj has a large number of religious buildings like mosques, türbes and churches, including Pasha's Mosque, Sailors' Mosque, Church-Mosque of Ulcinj and St. Nicholas' Church. Its oldest section is a well preserved castle-style community with features that remain from medieval times.
