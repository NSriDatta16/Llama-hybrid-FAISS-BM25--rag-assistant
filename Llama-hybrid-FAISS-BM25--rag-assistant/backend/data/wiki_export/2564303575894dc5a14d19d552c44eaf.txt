Professional career
Abell was selected by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 23rd round (178th overall) of the 1964 AFL Draft with a future draft pick, which allowed the team to draft him before his college eligibility was over.

In 1968, he returned to a reserve role after he was passed on the depth chart by rookie Jim Lynch. That season he recorded his only 2 career interceptions. 

On August 25, 1969, he was traded to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a conditional draft choice (not exercised). He was released by the Broncos on September 9.
