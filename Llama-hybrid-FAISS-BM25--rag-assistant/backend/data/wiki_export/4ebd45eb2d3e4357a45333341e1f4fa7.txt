The following events occurred in December 1965:

December 1, 1965 (Wednesday)
The Border Security Force was established in India as a special force to guard the country's borders with Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Nepal, and Bhutan.
The village of 't Haantje, Drenthe, in the Netherlands, narrowly escaped a disaster, when a French company drilling for gas began to lose control of the enormous gas pressure, resulting in a huge gas eruption. The ground around the hole caved in, swallowing all of the drilling equipment. The gas eruption would eventually be stopped by a cement injection from a new drilling hole. A small lake surrounded by a forest would become a permanent reminder of the near-miss.
The United Church in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands was founded by a merger of the Protestant denominations "Presbyterian Church in Jamaica" and "Congregational Union of Jamaica".
The first airlift of Cuban émigrés into the United States began, with 75 Cuban citizens, mostly women and children, taking off from Varadero on a Pan American Airways DC-7, and arriving in Miami one hour later.
Billy Jones became the first African-American to play in the Atlantic Coast Conference, integrating the exclusively white college basketball circuit in the south Atlantic states in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. Jones played briefly in a game for the University of Maryland against Penn State.
George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, and Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC Director Wernher von Braun discussed Marshall's briefing on the S-IVB Workshop concept presented at NASA Headquarters the previous day. Mueller asked that MSFC formulate a program development plan and present it at the next meeting of the Manned Space Flight Management Council. Specifically, Mueller demanded that the plan include experiments to be carried aboard the Workshop; funding arrangements; and where development work should be done (in house, or elsewhere). In addition, he asked that MSFC submit two such plans, one for the unpressurized and another for the pressurized version of the Workshop. In effect, Mueller gave Marshall the "green light" to begin the Orbital Workshop program. At von Braun's request, the Workshop received the status of a separate project, with William Ferguson as Project Manager.

An unidentified United States Marine stationed in South Vietnam at Da Nang allegedly vandalized the Khue Bac Pagoda by beheading the shrine's golden image of Gautama Buddha. By December 8, 500 Buddhist protesters marched through the streets of Da Nang after Khue Bac's principal monk, Thich Giac Ngo, threatened to disembowel himself to atone for allowing the Buddha to be destroyed. U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge promised to investigate the incident fully and to compensate the monastery for the damage, which included an injunction from other Buddhist monks that the Khue Bac was "contaminated and could not be used again".
Ten Royal Air Force jet fighters from Britain arrived in Lusaka, following Zambia's appeal for British help against Rhodesia, and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson said that a battalion of 600 Royal Scots Army infantrymen would follow if Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda agreed that they would remain under British command while on Zambian soil. Wilson also said that no British troops would cross into Rhodesia unless Rhodesia either attempted to attack Zambia, or attempted to shut off power from the Kariba Dam, across the Zambezi River, that supplied hydroelectric power to both nations. President Kaunda had asked Britain to invade Rhodesia in order to seize control of the Kariba Dam and to occupy the northern part of Rhodesia that bordered Zambia.
At Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 35 of the 36 members of the Organization of African Unity threatened to sever diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, unless the British government ended the rebellion of Rhodesia by December 15. The exception was The Gambia, which did not have a representative present at the five-hour session.
The Beatles released their album Rubber Soul in the United Kingdom, followed by an American release of Rubber Soul that included most of the songs, along with some that had been omitted from the U.S. release of Help!. On the same day, a Beatles song that was not on the album, "Day Tripper", was released as a single. On the other side (the "B" side) of the same 45 rpm record was "We Can Work It Out", which would receive more airplay and would reach number one in the United Kingdom and the United States, making it the most popular "B" side song in history.
The Who released their debut album My Generation in the UK, followed by a US release the following year. The album contains the title track, which is considered to be the band's signature song.
Princess Cruises, an ocean liner service which would be made famous by the 1980s television series The Love Boat, began services with the departure of a chartered ship, the Canadian Pacific Lines steamer Princess Patricia, from Los Angeles on the first of ten 14-day cruises along Mexico's west coast, with stops at La Paz, Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco and Mazatlán. Seattle businessman Stanley McDonald inaugurated the Princess line after a six-month practice run in 1962, with the steamer Yarmouth, coinciding with the operation of the Seattle World's Fair, which had been in progress. On December 15, 1967, McDonald would double his fleet with the departure of a second ship, which he would rename from Italia to Princess Italia.

Gemini 7, the fourth crewed mission of the Gemini program, was launched into orbit from complex 19 at Cape Kennedy at 1:30 in the afternoon. The primary objectives of the mission, flown by command pilot Astronaut Frank Borman and pilot Astronaut James A. Lovell, Jr., were demonstrating crewed orbital flight for approximately 14 days and evaluating the physiological effects of a long-duration flight on the crew. Among the secondary objectives were providing a rendezvous target for the Gemini 6A spacecraft, orbital station-keeping with the second stage of the Gemini launch vehicle and with spacecraft No. 6, and using lightweight pressure suits. Borman and Lovell would team up again three years later on Apollo 8, as they and William A. Anders would become the first humans to orbit the Moon.
Eastern Air Lines Flight 853, a propeller-driven Lockheed Super Constellation with 54 people on board, and TWA Flight 42, a Boeing 707-131B carrying 58 people, collided over Carmel, New York, with the Boeings left wing striking the Super Constellations tail. The TWA flight landed safely at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, despite having  of its left wing sheared off after taking evasive action, while the Eastern plane crashed in a pasture on Hunt Mountain near Danbury, Connecticut, and caught fire, killing four people of the 54 on board. The TWA flight from San Francisco to New York had been assigned at  altitude, while the Eastern plane from Boston to Newark, New Jersey, was assigned to  when the two collided.

December 5, 1965 (Sunday)
In the Philippine Sea about  from the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, a United States Navy Douglas A-4E Skyhawk aircraft carrying a B43 nuclear bomb fell into the ocean from the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga, killing its pilot, Lieutenant (j.g.) Douglas M. Webster. The aircraft, the thermonuclear weapon and Webster's remains would never be recovered. The United States Department of Defense would not reveal the proximity of the lost weapon to Japanese territory until 1989.
The first spontaneous political demonstration in the Soviet Union, and that nation's first civil rights protest, began in Pushkin Square in Moscow, where protesters gathered in response to the arrest of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel in what would later be called the "Glasnost Meeting" (Miting Glasnosty). The date selected was the Soviet Union's 30th annual Constitution Day holiday, and the location was the square named for one of Russia's most revered writers, Alexander Pushkin. Human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva would recall later that while Vladimir Bukovsky believed there were 200 participants when the demonstration began at 6:00 in the evening, she had been present and believed that it was a smaller number; 20 people were detained by KGB agents, but released after a few hours, although 40 of the known participants were expelled from their scientific institutes. Mathematician Alexander Esenin-Volpin was among the speakers who urged that Sinyavsky and Daniel be given the fair and open trial guaranteed by the 1936 constitution, and the Constitution Day protest was repeated every year until the close of the 1970s.
France's President Charles de Gaulle won more votes than the other five candidates in the French presidential election, but his 10,828,523 votes out of more than 24 million cast fell short of a majority, forcing a December 19 runoff between de Gaulle and second-place finisher François Mitterrand, who won 7,694,003 votes.
The military service of the Avro Lancaster bomber came to an end when the Fuerza Aérea Argentina's B-040 airplane crashed at the Río Gallegos airport.  The Argentine Air Force had been the last military force anywhere to use the Lancaster, and B-040 was the last one that had still been airworthy.

About 45 hours into the Gemini 7 mission, astronaut Jim Lovell became the first man in space to operate without a space suit, after being uncomfortably hot in the cramped capsule where he and Frank Borman were to spend two weeks. It look Lovell more than an hour to remove the bulky garment, but both he and Borman agreed that the cabin temperature was more tolerable even when only one of them was in regular clothes. Eventually, ground control would allow both astronauts to continue without their suits, after initially insisting that one of the crewmembers would need to be suited during the flight.
The Soviet lunar probe Luna 8 crash landed on the Moon at a point in the Ocean of Storms west of the Kepler crater at 21:51:30 UTC.

Anastas Mikoyan resigned from the largely ceremonial job as the Soviet Union's head of state, the President of the Presidium, which he had held since July 15, 1964. Mikoyan had been one of the original Soviet Communist Party members at the time of the October Revolution in 1917. The 1,500 delegates to the Supreme Soviet gave Mikoyan a standing ovation when he asked to be relieved for health reasons, then voted immediately to elevate Ukrainian official and CPSU Central Committee Secretary Nikolai V.

The scheduled launch of the Gemini 6A mission was aborted after the countdown had reached zero and the ignition command was given. Only 1.2 seconds after the Titan II GLV rocket engines were ignited, the Master Operations Control Set automatically shut them back down. The launch was canceled at 9:54 a.m., EST. Emergency procedures delayed raising the erector until 11:28, so the crew was not removed until 11:33 a.m. Launch was rescheduled for December 15. The fault was traced back to a cord that was plugged into the rocket and that would normally have remained in place until the rocket had risen a few inches off the ground; when the cord came loose early, the launchpad computer sent back a false signal that the rocket was already on its way up and the failure in the sequence led to the shutdown.

An American RB-57F Canberra spy plane with two crew members on board disappeared while flying over the Black Sea, after taking off from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. At 1215Z (2:15 p.m. at the base), the plane, codenamed "BIG RIB 06", began to deviate from its reconnaissance route and began to lose altitude. No Soviet fighters were in the area, and there were no mayday calls from the crew; it was speculated that the crew had lost consciousness at the  altitude and that the jet may have broken apart during the descent. Parts of the plane were found, but no trace of the crew was located, and the Soviet Union protested about the first American spy overflight since the U-2 incident on May 1, 1960; no further U.S. reconnaissance flights would be made from Turkey.
A Soviet R-7A Semyorka missile was successfully launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in a test flight that marked the first R-7 launch from Plesetsk.

Died: Mack Lee Hill, 25, American pro football player for the Kansas City Chiefs, died of a pulmonary embolism after undergoing routine knee surgery in a Kansas City hospital. Two days earlier, Hill had torn a ligament in his right knee while playing against the Buffalo Bills, and his temperature soared while he was in the post-op recovery room. The shock of the sudden loss of the popular fullback (an AFL All-Star in 1964 and the team's second leading rusher) led to the Chiefs retiring his jersey number, 36.

December 15, 1965 (Wednesday)
At least 10,000 and perhaps as many as 17,000 were killed in a single day in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) by a cyclone. Most of the victims were on the island of Maheshkhali in the Bay of Bengal, where the storm hit the coast at 12:15 in the morning, and a  high storm surge swept over its villages. Thousands of others were killed in the settlements in the Kaksbajar District (known at the time by its British Indian name of Cox's Bazar). More than 80 percent of the buildings on Maheshkali were destroyed, and its entire fishing fleet, along with those sailors who remained on or close to their boats, was destroyed; the island of Kutubdia lost several thousand people in three hours.

Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 performed the first controlled rendezvous in Earth orbit. Gemini 6A, the fifth crewed and first rendezvous mission in the Gemini program, was launched from complex 19 at Cape Kennedy at 8:37 a.m., EST. The primary objective of the mission, crewed by command pilot Astronaut Walter M. Schirra, Jr., and pilot Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford, was to rendezvous with spacecraft No. 7. Gemini 6A gradually adjusted its course to match the orbital path of Gemini 7, which had been sent up 11 days earlier with Frank Borman and Jim Lovell. By 2:27 in the afternoon, the two craft were  apart from each other, their closest approach, and remained at the same speed until Gemini 6 moved away at 7:05 in the evening. A later report said that the two spacecraft had come within  of each other at one time during their rendezvous. McDonnell Aircraft orbital mechanics engineer Marvin Czarnick would later be given credit as the individual most responsible for the successful calculations that led to the meeting in orbit.

By a margin of only 292-291, British Prime Minister Wilson's Labour Party government defeated a motion by the Conservative Party to scrap plans to replace the UK's "militia of weekend soldiers" with a better-organized military reserve force.
The cause of action that would lead to the landmark 1969 U.S. Supreme Court case of Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District began when 13-year-old Mary Beth Tinker and 15-year-old Chris Eckhardt wore black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War. Two days earlier, the principals of Harding Junior High School and Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa, had warned the Tinker family that the children would be suspended if they wore and declined to the protest armbands, and the children remained out of school for the rest of the year. Ultimately, the Court would rule, 7–2, that the wearing of armbands was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment right of free speech, although it would hold that schools could censor speech if it would "materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school."

The Gemini 6A flight ended with a nominal reentry and landing in the western Atlantic Ocean, just  from the planned landing point, at 10:29 a.m. The crew of astronauts Schirra and Stafford remained in the spacecraft, which was recovered an hour later by the prime recovery ship, the aircraft carrier .
MSFC Director Wernher von Braun (though not specifically called upon to do so) responded to David M. Jones' November 22 request for ideas on proposed goals for the Apollo Applications Program. Of all the alternative goals for AAP, von Braun said, that of exploring world resources for humanity's benefit was by far the most important. For its crewed space program, he said, NASA could not forever depend upon the thrill of adventure nor upon "sophisticated truths" such as the value of spinoff results or the blessings of more scientific knowledge. To place the idea of spaceflight firmly in the minds of the taxpaying public, therefore, NASA must produce solid results and material benefits that were readily visible and comprehensible. AAP goal number one neatly combined both broad popular appeal and true humanitarian needs. In view of the world's population explosion, with all its attendant resulting effects, von Braun stated, America's failure to avail itself of the vitally needed tools for a global resources management system would be a tragic mistake. Viewed in this perspective, the other alternative goals proposed for AAP thus became elements and stepping-stones within this broader long-range objective.

Hugh Addonizio, the Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, foiled a gang of bank robbers after finding himself near the crime scene while being driven to a tree-planting ceremony. The Mayor happened to be around the corner from the bank when he heard the bulletin on the police radio in his car, and spotted four men scrambling out of the Robert Treat Savings and Loan and into the getaway car. Addonizio then used his limousine telephone to call the police, and ordered his chauffeur, Frank Dangerio, to give chase. After their car lost control and crashed into a lightpole, the robbers fired shots at the Mayor's car, narrowly missing Dangerio and the Mayor, and police nabbed two of the suspects.

Reporter Stuart Bladon of the British automotive magazine Autocar would write later, "For motoring journalists accustomed to testing cars at high speeds and often cruising fast cars at 120mph when the motorway was clear, the news that there was to be a mandatory overall speed limit of 70mph was devastating.  It was brought in by the Transport Minister, Hugh Fraser, a dour Scotsman with little experience or knowledge of cars and modern driving conditions.  It would... run for four months as an 'experiment', but we all knew that once in force, it would never be lifted."
