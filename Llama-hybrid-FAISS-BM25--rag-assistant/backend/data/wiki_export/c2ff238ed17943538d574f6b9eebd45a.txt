Live+1 is a 1988 EP by the hard rock band Frehley's Comet. It was meant to serve as a stopgap until the release of the group's second studio album, Second Sighting. The first four songs were recorded live at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago, Illinois, on September 4, 1987. The last song, "Words Are Not Enough," is a shorter version of a demo recording the group made in 1985.
