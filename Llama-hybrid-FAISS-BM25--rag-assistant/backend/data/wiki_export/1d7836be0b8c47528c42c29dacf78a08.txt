History

The school was founded in 1930 by Elisabeth Morrow, daughter of Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, and Constance Chilton, with an initial enrollment of forty students. Since the mid-1950s, the school has expanded, enlarging its campus on the grounds of the Morrow Family estate.

In 2004-05, a new middle school was added, so that students can complete their education through the eighth grade.

In 2019-20, the school announced the expansion of its innovative Early Childhood Education Program to include children starting at age 2. There are no other academic programs for two-year-old children offered by independent schools within a commutable distance of Englewood, New Jersey.

Campus
The school's  campus encompasses three classroom buildings, two gymnasiums/performing arts center, three playgrounds, playing field, and a running brook. Facilities include three state-of-the-art science labs, technology labs, multiple libraries, two music and two art studios as well as a middle school social space and ceramics studio.

Morrow House, the former Georgian home of the Morrow family, is now used for fifth through eighth graders. The Little School, built in 1939, is home to first through fourth graders, while nursery and kindergarteners are in Chilton House, designed in 1970. Fourth grade was not connected to the Little School until 2005, when the admission rooms were moved.
