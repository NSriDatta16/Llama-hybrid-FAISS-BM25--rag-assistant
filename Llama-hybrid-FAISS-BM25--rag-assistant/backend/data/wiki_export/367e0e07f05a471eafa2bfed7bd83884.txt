Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue is a painting by American artist Georgia O'Keeffe. It depicts a cow skull centered in front of what appears to be a cloth background. In the center of the background is a vertical black stripe, surrounded by two vertical stripes of white laced with blue. Outside are two vertical red stripes.

O'Keeffe created the 39 7/8 x 35 7/8-inch (101.3 x 91.1Â cm) oil painting on canvas in 1931. Around that time, American artists sought themes for the "Great American Novel" or "Great American Story". It is part of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection (1952) of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
