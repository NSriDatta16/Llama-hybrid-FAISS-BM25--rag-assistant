The Academies at Englewood is a tuition-free college-preparatory public magnet high school in Englewood, New Jersey. The school is organized into five specialized academies in the areas of Medical Science, Business & Finance, Legal Studies, Computer Science, and Engineering & Technology. Founded in 2002, the state-funded college-preparatory school serves students in the ninth to twelfth grades in Bergen County, New Jersey, and was established to attract elite students across the county to an "academically-challenging, high-performing school", as well as raise the standard of public education in Bergen County. The school is commonly referred to as AE, or the Academies, and is part of the Englewood Public School District (formerly part of the Bergen County Technical Schools).

The school requires students in their final year of study to participate in a year-long internship each Wednesday in a field of interest, called Senior Experience. The academy also offers students access to technologies and labs rarely found in a high school setting. There are 18 academic departments at AE: Biology, Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, Business, Economics, Mathematics, Law, Engineering, Technology, English, History, World Language, Music/Performing Arts, Visual Arts, Heath/Physical Education, College Counseling, and Senior Experience. The school is structured similar to a university, with various academic departments, specialized majors, and career and technical education.

Establishment

As a result of the Board of Education of Englewood vs. Board of Education of Tenafly vs. Board of Education of Englewood Cliffs fifteen-year quarrel, the Englewood Public School District and the Supreme Court of New Jersey, under direction of Bergen County Academies founder Dr. John Grieco, the state-funded college-preparatory school serves students in the ninth to twelfth grades in Bergen County, New Jersey, and was established to attract elite students across the county to an "academically-challenging, high-performing school", secured $25 million for a new magnet high school program known as the Academies at Englewood in 2002. The school was established in hopes of attracting high-performing students in Bergen County, and to raise the standards of public education in the state of New Jersey. Unlike other county schools, the school does not have to meet any quotas or limits as to how many students can be accepted from a particular school district/borough, as it is a school of choice funded by the state.

The Academies at Englewood includes five specialized academies. The school was established in 2002 with four academies: the Academy for Finance & Business (AFB), Academy for Information Systems (ISA), Academy for Law and Public Safety (ALPS), and Academy for Pre-Engineering (APET). A fifth academy, the Academy for BioMedicine (ABM), was added in 2004. The school graduated its first class in 2006, with a graduating class of 91 at the time. The five academies are considered and recognized by the US Department of Education and the New Jersey Department of Education as separate schools under the parent magnet school.
