Alison Jackson (born May 15, 1960) is an English artist, photographer, and filmmaker. Her work explores the theme of celebrity culture. She makes realistic work of celebrities doing things in private using lookalikes.

Education
Alison Jackson attended the Chelsea College of Art and Design in London between 1993 and 1997, and graduated with a BA (Hons) in Fine Art (Sculpture). 

From 1997 to 1999, Jackson studied for a MA in Fine-art photography at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London.

Career

In 1999, Jackson created black-and-white photographs that appeared to show Princess Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed with a mixed-race love child. The photographs, titled Mental Images, were part of her graduation show at the RCA. She has used lookalikes to create photographs and films of celebrities in private situations. At the RCA, Jackson won a number of awards including The Photographers' Gallery Award and in 2002, her advertising campaign for Schweppes drinks won gold and silver awards from Campaign magazine.

Jackson wrote, directed, and co-produced BBC Two's 2003 series Doubletake with Tiger Aspect. The show won an award at the 2002 BAFTAs. She made a series of mockumentaries and fake biopics for Channel 4 about public figures, using George W Bush and Tony Blair lookalikes in a series of staged scenes of their public lives. Blaired Vision, broadcast on 26 June 2007, coincided with Blair's exit from office.

Jackson performed a one-woman show, Shot to Fame, in 2018 at Soho Theatre, and Double Fake Show in 2019 at Leicester Square Theater.

Since 2018, she has served as a Conservative Party (UK) councillor for the Chelsea Riverside ward on Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea.
