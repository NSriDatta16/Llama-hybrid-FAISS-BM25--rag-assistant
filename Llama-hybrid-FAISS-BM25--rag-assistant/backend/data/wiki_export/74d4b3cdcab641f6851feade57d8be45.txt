True Love is the tenth studio album by American country music singer Crystal Gayle. Released in November 1982, it peaked at #14 on the Billboard Country Albums charts.

Three of the album's tracks reached #1 on the Country Singles chart; "'Til I Gain Control Again", "Our Love is on the Faultline" and "Baby What About You".

The oft-covered track "Everything I Own" was released as a single in the UK where it peaked at #93 on the UK Singles Chart in early 1983. The song was originally recorded by the band Bread in 1972, and also was a UK #1 hit for Ken Boothe in 1974. In 1987, four years after Gayle's version, the song was recorded by Boy George (his first solo recording) who also had a UK #1 hit with it.
