Overview 
Since 1998, over 50 Big Brother Awards ceremonies have been held in 16 countries. They are presented around the world by the national members and affiliated organisations of Privacy International to corporations, public officials and governments that have shown a blatant disregard for privacy, or who have done the most to threaten personal privacy in their countries. 

The Australian Big Brother Awards (the "Orwells"), hosted by the Australian Privacy Foundation, were established in 2003. The awards also feature categories for individuals and organisations who have made a major positive contribution to protecting the privacy of Australians.

Nomination Process 
Nominations for the awards are solicited from the public either by mail or email to the APF (Australian Privacy Foundation). Nominations are then forwarded to a panel of judges who identify winners in each category. The judges have absolute discretion, and are not confined to the nominations received by members of the public. The winners are announced at a ceremony.
