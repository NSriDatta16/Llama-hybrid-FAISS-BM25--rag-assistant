Dan Antopolski (born 22 August 1972) is a British comic, actor and writer. He has appeared in various television programs and radio shows, and is best known to younger audiences for hosting the UK game show The Dare Devil. In 1998 Antopolski won the BBC New Comedy Award and in 2009 he won the Dave Award for Best Joke at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He has appeared at international comedy festivals in Montreal, Melbourne and New York. Antopolski has been a regular performer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, had minor roles in films and appeared in a number of panel shows.

Style 
Antopolski's comedy style has been described as surreal and ironic. He was described in a 2008 review as "a natural heir to Bill Bailey".

Awards 
In 1998 Antopolski won the BBC New Comedy Award and in 2009 won Joke Of The Year at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The joke, "Hedgehogs – why can't they just share the hedge?", went viral and Antopolski's agents had to issue a cease and desist order to a T-shirt company reproducing the joke. He was nominated for the "Perrier Best Newcomer Award" at the Edinburgh Festival in 2000 and shared a nomination for "Best Show" with Lee Mack and Catherine Tate in the same year. In 2001 his Antopolski 2000 performance was also nominated for "Best Show".
