TRANSNET, which stands for Transport, Service, and Networks, was a trade union in Germany and one of eight industrial affiliations of the German Confederation of Trade Unions.

Since autumn 2005, TRANSNET worked together with the "rival" union GDBA.

On November 30, 2010, the delegates of a union convention in Fulda decided to merge with GDBA to the new union EVG.
