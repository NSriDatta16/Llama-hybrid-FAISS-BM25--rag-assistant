Brimsdown is a neighbourhood of eastern Enfield in the London Borough of Enfield, north London, on the west side of the mid-to-lower Lea Valley.

Geography
The east of Brimsdown, that is, east of the eastern Lea Valley line is one of the borough's main commercial centres.  It divides into the Brimsdown Industrial Estate comprising Watermill, Sovereign, Leeside Business Centres, Riverwalk Business Park and storage.  Its far north is the Enfield Power Station built on part of the former Brimsdown Power Station and an electricity sub-station.

Residential Brimsdown is south of Turkey Brook, extending as far south as Jeffreys Road by the two blocks of the Trafalgar and Centenary Trading Estate units. It is home to the Brimsdown Industrial Estate and also includes a residential area just west of the Lea Valley railway line.  The western boundary is half way to the other Lea Valley line for this station-centric neighbourhood, where used as a term.

This area was the easternmost part of the old parish of Enfield which ecclesiastically is today divided into six, the present relevant parish being Enfield Highway a secular division of Enfield which competes with the west of the area for its identity, particularly around the irregular polygon of Durants Park, a large park, which is shared between both areas.

The area east of the Lea Valley Lines railway is almost exclusively industrial use, whereas west is a residential area primarily built up from the 1930s which blends into Enfield Highway to the west, Ponders End to the south and to the north Enfield Wash and Enfield Lock. This residential area around Brimsdown Avenue, Brimsdown railway station and Brimsdown School is at the heart of a Brimsdown neighbourhood, within Enfield, identity.
