Bahad (, short for  Bsis Hadrakha (), lit. Training base) is a military training base in the Israel Defense Forces. Each Bahad deals with a certain field, such as law enforcement or logistics. Generally, each Bahad belongs to a certain corps and conducts all courses required by the corps in question. Some training bases also train the new recruits of the corps.

The Israel Defense Forces also has several Bahads which don't belong to any particular corps and exist for the sole purpose of training new recruits. They are called recruit training bases, or Batars (, short for Bsis Tironut ()).

Many Bahads were located in Camp Yadin (Tzrifin), until the establishment of Camp Ariel Sharon in southern Israel. Tzrifin is being evacuated and sold to civilian contractors (due to high real estate value.) Camp Sharon is now the IDF's official training school base.
