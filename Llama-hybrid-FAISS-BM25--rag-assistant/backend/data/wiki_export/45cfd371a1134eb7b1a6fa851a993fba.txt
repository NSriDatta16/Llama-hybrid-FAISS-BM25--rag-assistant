Ronny Weller (born 22 July 1969 in Oelsnitz, Saxony) is a German weightlifter who competed for East Germany and later for Germany.

During the 1990s, he was three times world champion, and broke world records 11 times. He participated in the Olympic Games five times, winning four medals. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens he had to retire from the contest due to an injury he suffered during the snatch competition.

He is, jointly with fellow (East) German Ingo Steinhöfel, the second weightlifter to compete at five Olympics. The first was Hungarian Imre Földi from 1960-76.
