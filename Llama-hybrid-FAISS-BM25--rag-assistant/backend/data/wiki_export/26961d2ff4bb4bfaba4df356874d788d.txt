2020 Ukrainian Administrative Reform 

In July 2020, Ukraine conducted an administrative reform throughout its de jure territory. This included Crimea, which was at the time occupied by Russia, and is still ongoing as of October 2023. Crimea was reorganized from 14 raions and 11 municipalities into 10 raions, with municipalities abolished altogether. The territory of Bilohirsk Raion was expanded to also include the territories of Nyzhnohirskyi Raion, but has not yet been implemented due to the ongoing Russian occupation.
