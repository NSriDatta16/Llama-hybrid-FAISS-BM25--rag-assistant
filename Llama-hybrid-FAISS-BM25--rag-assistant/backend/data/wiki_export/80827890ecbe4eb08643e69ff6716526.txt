History

When the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions were created in 1941, each had a Scout Company consisting of seven officers and 132 NCOs and enlisted men divided into a headquarters unit and three platoons.  The unit was equipped with M3 Scout Cars and a motorcycle platoon. In 1949, the formation of an Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion on the East Coast was approved and the battalion was officially activated on 1 December 1950 at a tent camp area at Lejeune. It was later moved to Stone Bay Camp. The battalion's first commanding officer was Major Regan Fuller. Upon formation, the new battalion perpetuated the history of the marine scout companies that had served in the Pacific during World War II.

World War II

Tarawa, November 1943

In November 1943, the Marine recon units of 2nd Marine Division participated in the seizure and occupation of Tarawa Atoll, the site of a strategically important airfield. Prior to D-Day on November 10, no preliminary reconnaissance was performed except the submarine periscope photography taken by Capt. James Jones, of VAC Amphib Recon Company aboard the . The first ashore at Betio was a Scout-Sniper Platoon of 2nd Marine Regiment led by 1st Lieutenant William D. Hawkins.

Hawkins was tasked with securing the island ramp on one of the two long piers extending into the lagoon. He and his recon-scout platoon raced ahead of the first wave in two Higgins Boats and landed on the pier where they were placed under heavy machine gun fire. Since there were petrol drums at the end of the pier in the line of enemy fire, Hawkins sent most of his Marines back down the ramp then proceeded with only five men, four scouts and one combat engineer with a flamethrower.  Once they burned and had blown up every hiding place left on the pier, they withdrew to the boat. Hawkins then commandeered three LVTs and transferred his men from both LCVPs to these for the trip to shore where they joined their regiment for the rest of the battle. Hawkins was later killed during this action and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Another Scout-Sniper Platoon from the 8th Marines assisted in the main assault landing on D-Day, while the Company D (Scouts), 2nd Tank Battalion worked extensively in the seizure and occupation of other islands in the Tarawa Atoll. This included Eita and many unnamed islets between Betio and Bairiki. The adjacent atolls of Abaiang, Marakei and Maiana were inspected for fortifications, supplies or recent occupancy.

Saipan, June 1944

During the Battle of Saipan, the 2nd Marine Division's scout company performed a series of special missions with 4th Marine Division's scout company, which included a recon detachment with 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment (1/9).  Seizing the summit of Mount Tapochau, the highest point on the island, they later repulsed a Japanese counterattack.  Both Admiral Richmond K. Turner and General Holland M. Smith declared Saipan secured on July 9, 1944.

Trivia

A very loose interpretation of the battalion was featured as the main unit in the 1986 movie Heartbreak Ridge starring Clint Eastwood. The film depicts the battalion's involvement in Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion of Grenada.

A 2017 autobiographical short-story collection, titled No Joy, depicts life in the battalion from late 2003 to mid 2006.
