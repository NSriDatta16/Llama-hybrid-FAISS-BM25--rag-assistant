The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock is a compilation album from the American rock band Poison, released to celebrate the band's 20 year anniversary. It has sold more than 1 million copies to date in the U.S as of September 2009. The album was released on April 3, 2006, on EMI

Release and promotion
The album features many songs from the band's 20-year career. Most notable is the song "Every Rose Has Its Thorn", which was the band's biggest hit, a power ballad. A rare cover of the KISS classic "Rock and Roll All Nite" appears, previously only available on the soundtrack to the movie "Less Than Zero". The compilation also includes a new single, the Grand Funk Railroad roadie classic "We're an American Band", which also features a music video.

The cover art is taken from the book Pornography: Opposing Viewpoints.

The album was produced by Don Was and marked Poison's return to the Billboard 200 top 20 charts for the first time since 1993. The compilation debuted at No. 17, quite an impressive showing for a hair metal band in 2006, and perhaps showing the beneficial effect of many Behind the Music-type shows on VH1, where Poison's hair metal antics were relived. The album also charted at No. 5 on the Top Rock Albums, No. 4 on the Top Catalog Albums and No. 10 on the Top Hard Rock Albums chart.

"The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock" was certified Gold in 2006 by the RIAA.
