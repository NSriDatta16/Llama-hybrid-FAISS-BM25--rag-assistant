Washington Executive Airport , also known as Washington Executive Airpark or Hyde Field, was a public use general aviation airport located  southwest of the central business district (CBD) of Clinton, in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.  The airport ceased operations on November 30, 2022, following a bankruptcy sale of the property. 

Hyde Field was one of the "Maryland 3" airports located within the Washington, D.C. Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ), so it was subject to the Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) restrictions.

It is located just  east of a slightly smaller airport called Potomac Airfield.

History 
Hyde opened in 1934 as a training field for United States Army aviators.

Due to the onerous SFRA restrictions leading to declining revenues at the airport, in 2008 there were plans to shut it down and redevelop the land. However, the airport remained open and operational until 2022.

Closure 
On October 31, 2022, airport tenants were notified that the field was closing and were given until November 30, 2022, to remove their aircraft and any belongings after which the new owners will repurpose the property for housing development.

Facilities 
Washington Executive Airport/Hyde Field covered  and had one runway:

 Runway 5/23:  x , surface: asphalt
