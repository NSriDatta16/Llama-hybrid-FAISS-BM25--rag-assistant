Nogometni klub Drava Ptuj (), commonly referred to as NK Drava Ptuj or simply Drava, was a Slovenian football club, which played in the town of Ptuj. Named after the Drava river which flows through the town, Drava Ptuj has spent a total of seven season in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top division of the Slovenian football pyramid. The club was dissolved following the 2010–11 Slovenian Second League when they were unable to obtain competition licences issued by the Football Association of Slovenia.

In 2004, the club founded NŠ Drava Ptuj, which was to be responsible for the club's youth selections. However, the track records and honours of the two clubs are kept separate by the Football Association of Slovenia.
