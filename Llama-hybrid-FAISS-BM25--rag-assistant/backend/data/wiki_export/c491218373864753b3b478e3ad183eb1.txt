Nerve Net is the eleventh solo studio album by Brian Eno, released on September 1, 1992 on All Saints Records. It marked a return to more rock-oriented material, mixed with heavily syncopated rhythms, experimental electronic compositions and occasional elements of jazz. The ambient sensibility is still present on several tracks, though it is often darker and moodier than the pieces Eno is best known for.

The album released 12-inch and CD singles for the pieces "Ali Click" and "Fractal Zoom", both of which featured various remixes of the songs by the likes of Moby, Markus Dravs and Isaac Osapanin. It received mixed reviews upon release.
