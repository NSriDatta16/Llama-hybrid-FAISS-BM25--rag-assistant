Static trapeze, also known as fixed trapeze, is a type of circus art performed on the trapeze.  In contrast to the other forms of trapeze, on static trapeze the bars and ropes mainly stay in place.

Most often, the static trapeze is about  wide and the bar is generally  inches in diameter.  The ropes are at least two human lengths, as many figures are performed on the ropes above the bar.  The ropes can be made of many materials, including cotton or hemp, and often have a wire woven inside.
It can be performed by a single artist or two partners working together. A single artist will do tricks above and below the bar, the ropes playing just as important a part as the bar. A partner act will involve the partners working together â€” supporting each other's weight, throwing, lifting and catching each other. 

Self-standing trapezes can be purchased for home use.

Multiple trapeze is an act entailing the use of more than one trapeze, typically two or three. In these acts, multiple people perform simultaneously.
The most common type of multiple trapeze is a "triple trapeze". A triple trapeze has one long bar, held up by ropes, basically three trapezes put together, with the middle trapeze sharing the ropes of the other two. Multiple trapeze can also refer to an abstract structure with trapeze like structures, inside which multiple artists may perform.

A triple trapeze is a type of static (still) trapeze with three trapezes on one bar. Therefore, there are four ropes connecting this trapeze to its frame, or whatever it is hanging from. Performers specialize in synchronized tricks. One example of a triple trapeze act can be seen in Cirque du Soleil's show Varekai. An experimental cage-like structure was created for the show, but was ultimately scrapped in production. However, the structure did appear in the 'making of' documentary Fire Within.

Repertoire
 
Static trapeze routines are choreographed from a number of standard tricks, movements, and positions, including:

 sitting - generally used to describe sitting on the bar, with your shoulders parallel to the bar, with both legs in front of the bar
 full beats - hanging from the bar with your hands, keeping legs straight and together, bringing feet up to level with the bar and then swinging down, through vertical and back with feet returning up to the level of the bar
 knee beats - hanging from the knees, bringing hands up above the level of the bar, then straightening the body, swinging backward down through the vertical, and back with hands returning above the level of the bar
 catcher's lock (or catches) - hanging upside down, with the bar across the front of the thighs, and the ropes passing inside the bent knees. This is generally a strong position to catch or hold another person (hence the name).
 bird's nest - belly down, arched backward, tops of the feet one on each rope above the hands, with hands still on the bar
 mermaid - similar to bird's nest but both feet on the same rope
