Hussey is a surname. The surname is common in the British Isles, as well as locations associated with settlement by the people of these regions. The name has two main sources of origin. The first is of Norman origin, coming from the region of La Houssaye in Northern France. In Old French, the name relates to holly ('hous' in Old French). Hussey also has an Irish origin, stemming from the Ó hEodhasa family.
