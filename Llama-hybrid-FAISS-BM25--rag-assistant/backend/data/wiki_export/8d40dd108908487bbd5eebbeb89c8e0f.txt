Bernard O'Mahoney (born 15 March 1960, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England) is an English author, security detail, and former soldier. After taking control of security at a nightclub he became associated with Tony Tucker, a drug dealer who was shot along with two others in what is known as the Rettendon murders.

This event captured the imagination of the media and forced O'Mahoney to retire from the security industry. He began writing books about his experiences. Several of these books have since become best sellers, two of the books have been made into a film. The books in question are The Essex Boys and Bonded By Blood which is based upon true events of the Rettendon murders.

O'Mahoney is also known for his affair with Michelle Taylor, a woman who was accused of (and who he now believes committed) the murder of Alison Shaughnessy. His 2001 book The Dream Solution focused on the case.

The Dream Solution: The Murder of Alison Shaughnessy - and the Fight to Name Her Killer

Published in 2001 with Mick McGovern, this book focused on the high-profile murder of Alison Shaughnessy in 1991. O'Mahoney had originally been one of those who campaigned for the release of the Taylor sisters who were convicted of murdering Shaughnessy, before having an affair with one of them. He became suspicious of her obsessive behaviour and discovered a letter that indicated she was guilty of the murder. He confronted her and she broke down, confessing to her guilt. From then on O'Mahoney has campaigned to have the Taylors re-convicted.

Wannabe in My Gang
Published in March 2004, it tells of the now-deceased Kray Twins, Ronnie and Reggie, who dominated the gangland scene of London for a number of years until they were arrested for murder in 1968, as well as O'Mahoney's correspondence with them during their imprisonment.

It also tells of the notorious three "Essex Boys" drug dealers who terrorised Essex with drug dealing and violence during the early to mid-1990s before they were found shot dead in a Range Rover in December 1995. The book also discusses British crime-figure Dave Courtney, and the Kray twins and gives O'Mahoney's opinions on books published by criminals.

It also tells of O'Mahoney's violent childhood and youth, including the abuse he suffered at the hands of his alcoholic father and Bernard's involvement with football hooliganism and the Nazi/far-right movement and subsequently his change of views and how he helped infiltrate the British Ku Klux Klan with a News of the World reporter.

Essex Boys – The New Generation

Flowers in God's Garden
Published on 1 April 2012, nearly a decade after O'Mahoney began work on it, Flowers in God's Garden tells of O'Mahoney's correspondence with a number of high-profile serial killers and child killers, including "Yorkshire Ripper" Peter Sutcliffe, Roy Whiting (who murdered seven-year-old Sarah Payne in West Sussex in 2000) and Ian Huntley (the school caretaker who murdered two 10-year-old girls in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002).

It also tells of how he gained a written confession from Richard Blenkey for the murder of seven-year-old Paul Pearson at Marske, Cleveland, in 1991, and how he employed the same tactic when writing to Shaun Armstrong after he was charged with the murder of Hartlepool toddler Rosie Palmer three years later. In both instances, the letters which O'Mahoney received were shown to the jury at the trial, and both men admitted the murders.

In 2001, Armstrong lodged a claim for damages against O'Mahoney for "breach of confidence", as O'Mahoney had posed as a woman when writing to Armstrong, who had urged him not to tell anyone of his admission to the murder of Rosie Palmer, but he later withdrew his challenge for damages.
