"Bat Country" is a song by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released in August 2005 as the second single from their third album, City of Evil. Avenged Sevenfold won 'Best New Artist Video' at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards for "Bat Country" and on May 4, 2021, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA. For these reasons, "Bat Country" is often believed to be the band's most commercially successful song.

Background and content 
The song's main influence comes from Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with the title itself being a direct quote from the book in which Raoul Duke (the alter-ego pseudonym of Thompson) is on his way to Las Vegas while being affected by various drugs. The character hallucinated  huge bats and manta rays in the sky, and gasps to his companion Dr. Gonzo, "We can't stop here. This is bat country."

The following quote, also included at the beginning of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is referred to twice throughout the song (at the beginning and the bridge before the last chorus) and is shown at the beginning of the music video.
"He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." – Samuel Johnson

Also referenced in the song is a lyric derived from the final words spoken about Dr. Gonzo at the end of the film adaptation.  The lyric is used at the end of the second breakdown of the song, as the final lyric of the song.
"There he goes. One of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, and too rare to die." – Raoul Duke

Shortly after the writing of the song, Thompson committed suicide.

Chart performance 
Throughout 2008, "Bat Country" was in the top 40 of the UK Rock Chart,  and shared the chart with up to three of the band's other songs (including but not limited to: Afterlife, Burn It Down and Dear God). The song was on and off the charts throughout 2008, and eventually peaked at number 9 in December of that year.
