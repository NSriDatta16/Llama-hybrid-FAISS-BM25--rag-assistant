Monster Warriors is an original Canadian television series which aired on YTV in Canada and also on Jetix since April 2006 in the United Kingdom. It was created by Wilson Coneybeare and produced by Coneybeare Stories and distributed by Bejuba! Entertainment. The series concluded its run on July 26, 2008, with a TV movie titled Monster Warriors Finale on YTV.

Plot

Season 1
The series, a purposely campy cross between the Power Rangers and Ghostbusters, follows the adventures of four teenagers fighting to safeguard Capital City from the vengeful wrath of insane and disgruntled old B-Movie director Klaus Von Steinhauer who possesses the ability to bring his cinematic monsters to life ("I make ze monsters big!"). Over the course of the series, various story arcs occur that expand the series' cast and city locations. Each week sees the teens customize common household objects into useful weapons to fight against monstrous creations.

Season 2
The battle continues as the Monster Warriors work from their new hideout: a deserted secret bomb shelter beneath Luke's house. The newly outfitted warriors get caught in the battle between Von Steinhauer and the new Mystery Monster Maker. The new monsters are half animal, half machine.

Characters

Core characters
 Luke
Luke is the reserved yet tough leader of the Warriors. He is rich, tall and handsome and holds the keys to the group's sweet purple convertible and their headquarters at his home. He is Tabby's love interest. Although he acts tough most of the time, he still has certain fears, particularly of forests. His family fortune comes from his environmental activist parents' invention of coin deposit locks on shopping carts.
 Antonio
Antonio is the darkly handsome scientific genius of the gang. As a recent immigrant to Capital City, he devoted his considerable intellectual abilities to learning to speak English without any trace of a foreign accent, and he has a vast knowledge of fields like zoology, astronomy, geology and history. Although he is shy and kind of nerdy, he still has many female admirers.
 Tabby
This blond 17-year-old fancies herself the second in command of the group and is Luke's love interest. She is an ace inventor who can turn ordinary household gadgets into monster-blasting weaponry. She is also the captain of the volleyball team and school class president and is an all-around goody two-shoes- although she doesn't like being called one.
 Vanka
She is the bravest of the Warriors and a dedicated practitioner of obscure martial arts. Tough, fierce and virtually fearless, the athletic brunette is, however, particularly uncomfortable with heights, has failed her driving test multiple times and has had a string of hopeless boyfriends. She later develops a relationship with Antonio.

Other recurring characters
 Klaus Von Steinhauer - Monster movie director turned mad monster-maker.
 Missy Gore - Perky, narcoleptic city power company worker turned villainous sidekick (Season 1). Although she developed feelings for the much older Klaus, in Season 2 she left for dentistry school.
 Mayor Mel - Mayor of Capital City, a former actor in Von Steinhauer movies turned above ground pool salesman turned politician with a never-ending faith in the Monster Warriors. (Possibly based on former Toronto mayor Mel Lastman)

 Kreeger - Big, bearded monster movie expert and owner of the Monster Video movie rentals/comics and collectibles shop.
 Superintendent McClellan - Mayor Mel's ambitious and incompetent adviser who constantly suspects teenagers are behind all wrongdoing in Capital City. He becomes mayor in the second season but resigns and goes back to being superintendent in Astrosaurus vs Gigantobeast. He is always on the phone or yelling.
 Dink Doorman - A news reporter whose stories often revolve around the Monster Warriors and their battles and who also hosts a call-in movie show called "The Big Money Movie". Apparently does not know the meaning of the word "incredulous", often using it instead of "incredible".
 Fire Chief Holswade – Tabby's father, the fire department chief.
 Eustace McCafferty – nerdy high school student that is in the school science club and astronomy club.

 Praying Mantis – This monster was also featured in both seasons. (possibly based on Kamacuras)

 Blob – An amoeba-type monster that eats anything it wants, such as a truck, bricks, and a wheelbarrow, and separates via mitosis into a second Blob and engulfs and attempts to digest Mayor Mel and nearly engulfs Vanka (Possibly based on "The Blob" from the sci-fi horror film from 1958.)
 Worm – An earthworm that eats subway trains.
 Giant Metal-Eating Radioactive Junk Monster – One of Klaus' seemingly failed experiments, but when he threw it out it started absorbing all the metal in the junkyard, becoming a radioactive menace so deadly even Klaus wanted to destroy it.
 Termites – Found in the fire station's basement. Then the queen trapped Mayor Mel in City Hall.
 Giant Mud Monster – A monster made out of mud. (possibly based on Hedorah)
 Man-Eating Piranhas – Man-eating fish that can fly and come out of water.
 Enormous Ladybug – Was shrunken back to normal size by Tabby's weapon that was later smashed. Klaus never got a chance to finish it so it is one of the few "friendly" Monsters.
 Giant Sea Cucumber – Eats ships within Capital City's Harbour and Vanka's new teacher, who was apparently a "mysterious alien" in disguise. Likely created by the aliens and was meant as a trap to kill the Monster Warriors.
 Giant Frog Army –  tall frogs.

 Gigantic Penguins
Gigantic penguins created by Klaus after he shoots his monster virtualizer at a bunch of random junk he tossed into Capital City Harbour.
