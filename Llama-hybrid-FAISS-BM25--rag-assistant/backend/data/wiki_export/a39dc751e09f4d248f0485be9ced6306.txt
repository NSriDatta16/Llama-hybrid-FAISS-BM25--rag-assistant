, better known by his ring name , also written Danshoku Dieno, is a Japanese professional wrestler. Dino has spent most of his career competing for DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDT), where he plays an overly exaggerated homosexual character. His ring name comes from the Japanese name for the character Baron Dino from the manga series Sakigake!! Otokojuku.

Early life
In elementary, junior and high school, Dino played soccer alongside Keita Kanemoto who was his team captain.

Professional wrestling career
Dino was trained in shoot fighting prior to training to be a wrestler and he incorporated this training into his wrestling style.

In addition to wrestling in DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDT), he has also competed in several independent wrestling promotions around Japan, including Dragon Gate, Ice Ribbon, Kaientai Dojo, Osaka Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max. In February 2007, Dino made his first excursion overseas, as he debuted for a few American independent promotions such as Chikara, Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and International Wrestling Cartel (IWC).

On April 4, 2019, at DDT Is Coming to America, Dino and Antonio Honda were defeated by Joey Ryan and Royce Issacs. Later on, he defeated Saki Akai to become the 1,354th Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship for the 23rd time.
