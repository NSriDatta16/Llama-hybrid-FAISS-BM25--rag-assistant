"From the Beginning" is a song written by Greg Lake and performed by the progressive rock trio Emerson, Lake & Palmer.  It was released on their 1972 album Trilogy. It hit #39 in the United States and was their highest charting single there.

Composition
The song was written in the key of A minor. It is driven by an acoustic guitar line with layers of electric guitar (both rhythm and lead), electric bass guitar, and sung by Lake, with some backing on drums (played by Carl Palmer with congas, tympani mallets and without cymbals), and with a distinctive closing synthesizer solo from Keith Emerson, accompanied by overdubbed synthesizer sounds.
This song was originally intended for King Crimson's debut album In the Court of the Crimson King, but band leader Robert Fripp didn't think it would fit into the album's context. 

Record World said that "Greg Lake gets a great sound out of his band on this acoustically jazzy number that highlights his voice and fine lyrics."
