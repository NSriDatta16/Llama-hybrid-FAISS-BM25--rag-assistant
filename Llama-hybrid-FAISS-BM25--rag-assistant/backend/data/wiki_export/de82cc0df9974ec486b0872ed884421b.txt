 established the standard cataloging system for Swedish rune inscriptions. Each inscription is identified by a province code and a catalog number. For example:

 U 11 - Uppland rune inscription 11
 Ög 179 - Östergötland rune inscription 179

Today, this cataloging system is used by electronic databases such as Rundata and commonly seen in scholarly publications. This cataloging system has also been imitated and extended by scholars in other countries.
