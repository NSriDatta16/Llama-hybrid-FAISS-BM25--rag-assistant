Education 
District Tando Allahyar is ranked at the 92nd position in the education score index of the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 published by Alif Ailaan. The education score is composed of the learning score, retention score, and gender parity score. In the middle school infrastructure index, which focuses on the availability of basic facilities and the building condition, Tando Allahyar ranks 75th. However, there was a steep improvement in almost all infrastructure indicators in Tando Allahyar in the year 2016-2017 including more availability of electricity and drinking water, access to toilets, and better building conditions.

Using data from the Standardized Achievement Test (SAT) report published by the Sindh government in 2017, it was found in the "2013-2018 Five Years of Education Reforms in Sindh. Wins, Losses and challenges for 2018-2023." report that Tando Allahyar ranked 8th for student achievement in the language in grade 8. However, with a score of only 41.68, it is still below average. In grade 8, Tando Allahyar ranked at the 7th position for student achievement in maths and 6th position for science.

Administrative and infrastructure issues remain a hindrance for every child in district Tando Allahyar to access free and quality education. Issues reported by the residents via the Taleem Do! App complain of the lack of absenteeism of teachers, lack of basic facilities, and the prevalence of shelter-less schools and closed schools. Some citizens also appeal for their children to be educated in the regional language, Sindhi, rather than Urdu or English. The debate on whether basic education should be provided in the regional, national or official languages has been a point of debate in Pakistan for several years.
