Legend
A saintly Brahmin once prayed and perfected the Manappully Bhagavathy, so the folklore goes. He did the prayers in his kitchen which is also known as the madappalli. That must be in course of time and usage, become "Manappulli". This Brahmins house was part of the "Yagakkara" where Agnihothra yagas were performed. This in turn must have changed to become "Yakkara" 
the present name. It is presumed that the place where this temple is situated derived its name from this.

Sree Manappulli Bhagavathi is Lord Shiva's daughter and she is Bhadrakaali. She was born out of the sacred "Jada" of Lord Shiva during Dakshayaga. Shree Manappulli Bhagavathi is black in colour, with four hands, each one having Soolam, Kapalam, gadkam and khedam. She has three eyes, four big teeth, a beautiful dress, several ornaments, in ghost vahana very bright and shining and fearful in appearance. She is well known to satisfythe desires of the devotees. It is said that the Goddess will be there whenever any devotee calls with real devotion.

After the Kodiyettam, a week full of pooja ceremonies and evenings with colourful cultural programmes are organized by the 'Vela Committee' (Festival Committee) which all ends with the grand day 'Manapullikavu Vela'. Many devotees from throughout Kerala and other southern states of India come to worship Bhagavathy on this auspicious day. The Vela day starts early with poojas to the Bhagavathy continuing with all day poojas. The 'Chaandh Abishekam', one of the important pooja during the day attracts flocks of devotees.
