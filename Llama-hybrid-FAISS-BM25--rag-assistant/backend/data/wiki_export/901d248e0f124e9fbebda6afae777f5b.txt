Joseph Martin "Jodie" Mudd (born April 23, 1960) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour.

Early life and amateur career 
Mudd was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He attended Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia where he developed into an honored amateur golfer.

Professional career 
Mudd successfully earned a spot on the PGA Tour during 1983 PGA Tour Qualifying School. Mudd won four PGA Tour events during his career. His top year was 1990, when he finished 5th on the final money list, and won two of the Tour's most prestigious non-majors: the Nabisco Championship and The Players Championship. His best finish in a major championship was T-4 at both 1987 Masters Tournament and the 1990 Open Championship.

Mudd would then become burned out from the grind of tour play and would reduce his schedule before leaving the PGA Tour in 1996. He made his Champions Tour debut on April 30, 2010, at the Mississippi Gulf Resort Classic, and played in a limited number of Champions Tour events that year. His best finish is T-20 at the 2010 Regions Charity Classic.
