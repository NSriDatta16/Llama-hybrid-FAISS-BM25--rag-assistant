The Swedish Painters' Union (, SMF or MÃ¥larna) is a trade union representing painters and decorators in Sweden.

The union was founded on 2 October 1887 at a meeting in Stockholm, and originally had 800 members.  It affiliated to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation in 1899, and by 1907 had grown to 4,298 members.  After a decade with fluctuating membership, it began growing again, reaching a maximum membership of 22,582 in 1966.  Since then, membership has steadily fallen, and in 2019 stood at 10,918.
