A Republican mid-decade redistricting made this Macon-based district more compact and somewhat more Republican. Incumbent Marshall faced a very tough challenge by former U.S. Representative Mac Collins, who represented an adjoining district from 1993 to 2005. Less than 60 percent of the population in Marshall's present 3rd District was retained in the new 8th District. The reconfigured 8th includes Butts County, which was the political base of Collins, who once served as chair of the county commission. On the other hand, the 8th also includes all of the city of Macon where Marshall served as mayor from 1995 until 1999. The race featured heavy spending, not only by the candidates themselves but also from independent groups. During the campaign, President George W. Bush attended a rally on Collins' behalf.
