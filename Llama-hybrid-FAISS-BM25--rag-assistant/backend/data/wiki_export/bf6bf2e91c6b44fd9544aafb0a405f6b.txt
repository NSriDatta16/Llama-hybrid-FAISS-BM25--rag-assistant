Points on the Curve is the second studio album by English new wave band Wang Chung, released in 1984.

Background
Points on the Curve is Wang Chung's first studio album since changing their name from Huang Chung and switching from Arista to the Geffen Records. It reached No. 34 on the UK album charts on 21 April 1984 and No. 30 on the Billboard 200 album charts on 14 July 1984. The album features the No. 1 dance single "Dance Hall Days" and includes the hit singles: "Don't Let Go", "Don't Be My Enemy" and "Wait". The album cover was designed, and featured art direction by Barney Bubbles, who would kill himself three months after this album was released in the UK.

Critical reception

The Philadelphia Inquirer deemed the band "mean-spirited fops." The Daily Breeze called the album "a collection of fairly standard, English dance numbers." By contrast, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, Kelvin Hayes wrote that "although the sound is a little dated, its craftsmanship still holds true."
