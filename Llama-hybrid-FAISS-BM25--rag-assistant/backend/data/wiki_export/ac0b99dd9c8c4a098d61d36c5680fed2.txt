Early years
Marianna Hill was born in Santa Barbara, California, to architect Frank Schwarzkopf and writer Mary Hawthorne Hill, who worked as a script doctor. United States Army General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. is her 2nd cousin.

Her father, a building contractor, worked in several countries, which resulted in Hill's education in California, Spain, and Canada. During her teenage years, her family settled in Southern California when her father purchased a restaurant there.

She then worked three summers at the La Jolla Playhouse, and later gained more experience at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. She was a life member of The Actors Studio as of January 1980. She adopted her mother's surname ("Hill") as her professional surname. She appeared in more than 70 films and television episodes.

Hill guest-starred in several 1960s sitcoms, including My Three Sons, Hogan's Heroes and Love, American Style, as well as in the original Star Trek series ("Dagger of the Mind", 1966, as Dr. Helen Noel) and Perry Mason ("The Case of the Greek Goddess", 1963, as Theba).

Hill continued to teach at the Method Studio in London, and made an appearance in the 2005 British film Coma Girl: The State of Grace, a part she got through the association of one of her students with the film's writer and director Dina Jacobsen.

Her last American film was Chief Zabu, which was filmed on the campus of Bard College in New York in 1986. The film was not released until 2016. In a rare public appearance, Hill attended the premier of the movie at the 2016 Fort Lauderdale Film Festival.
