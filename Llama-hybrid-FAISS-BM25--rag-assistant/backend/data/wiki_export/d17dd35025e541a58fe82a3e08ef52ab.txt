The anterior superior alveolar nerve (or anterior superior dental nerve) is a branch of the infraorbital nerve (itself a branch of the maxillary nerve (CN V2)). It passes through the canalis sinuosus to reach and innervate upper front teeth. Through its nasal branch, it also innervates parts of the nasal cavity.

Anatomy

Course and distribution 
It branches from the infraorbital nerve within the infraorbital canal at around the midpoint of this canal and enters the canalis sinuosus. It passes through towards the nose before passing inferior-ward and ramifying into branches which innervate the upper/maxillary incisor and canine teeth; it usually innervates all the anterior teeth.

Nasal branch 
It issues a nasal branch which passes through a minute canal in the lateral wall of the inferior nasal meatus and innervates the mucous membrane of the floor and anterior portion of lateral wall (as far superiorly as the opening of the maxillary sinus) of the nasal cavity. It ultimately emerges close to the root of the anterior nasal spine to innervate the adjacent portion of nasal septum.

Communications 
The nerve participates in the formation of the superior dental plexus by looping posterior-ward to communicate with the middle superior alveolar nerve.

The nasal branch communicates with nasal branches of the sphenopalatine ganglion.
