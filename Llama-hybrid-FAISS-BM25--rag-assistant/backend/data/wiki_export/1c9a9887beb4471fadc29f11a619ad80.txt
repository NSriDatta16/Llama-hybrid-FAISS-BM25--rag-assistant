The New York Rock and Soul Revue was a musical project that evolved out of a series of concerts produced and promoted by singer-songwriter Libby Titus at the Lone Star Roadhouse, the Spectrum and other Northeast concert venues, eventually coalescing around unofficial "band leader" Donald Fagen from 1989–1993. Fagen, the frontman and co-founder of Steely Dan, had largely focused on songwriting during that group's near decade-long hiatus in the 80s, and would go on to credit the unique blend of veteran talent Titus had assembled with reigniting his passion for performing live. It featured various musicians including Michael McDonald, Boz Scaggs and Phoebe Snow. 

The project released one album on 25 October 1991: The New York Rock and Soul Revue: Live at the Beacon (Giant Records), a compilation of material recorded earlier that year from live performances at New York City's Beacon Theatre.
