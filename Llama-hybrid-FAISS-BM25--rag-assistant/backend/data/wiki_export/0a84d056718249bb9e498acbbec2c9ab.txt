Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun (شيبان بن أحمد بن طولون) was the fifth and last vassal Emir of the Tulunids in Egypt (904-905). In 904–905 al-Muktafi invaded Egypt and reincorporated the country fully into the Abbasid Empire.

Shayban was one of the son of Ahmad ibn Tulun, he succeeded his nephew Harun ibn Khumarawayh, who was killed in a mutiny in December 904 during the invasion of Egypt by the Abbasid Caliphate. After years of mismanagement, the emirate was beyond rescue - he was forced to retreat with his army to Fustat, where on 10 January 905 he surrendered unconditionally to the Abbasid commander Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, ending the rule of the Tulunids.
