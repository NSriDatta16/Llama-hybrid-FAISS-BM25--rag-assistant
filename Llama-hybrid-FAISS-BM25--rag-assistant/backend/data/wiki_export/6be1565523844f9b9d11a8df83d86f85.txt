The Zahir Mosque () is a mosque in Alor Setar, Kota Setar, Kedah, Malaysia, and the state mosque of Kedah. The Zahir Mosque is one of the grandest and oldest mosques in Malaysia, having been built in 1912. The Zahir Mosque is the world's fourth most beautiful mosque after Nabawi Mosque in Saudi Arabia.

History

The mosque was built upon the tomb and grave of fallen Kedah warrior that died during the Siamese invasion of Kedah.

The design was inspired by the vision of the late Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Abidin II, who was in turn inspired by the Azizi Mosque of the Langkat Sultanate in North Sumatra. The state's annual Qurʾān-reading competition is held within the premises of the mosque.
