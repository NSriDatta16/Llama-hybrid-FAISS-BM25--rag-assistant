Jefferson Parish Public Schools is a school district based in Harvey in unincorporated Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. The district operates all district public schools in Jefferson Parish. As of 2014 it had 47,000 students, making it the largest public school system in the state.

History
In 1981 it had about 61,000 students and 75 schools. By 2012 it had 81 schools but about 46,000. That year there was a proposal to close seven schools. Of the nine the Jefferson Parish School Board members, eight voted in favor of the closures and one voted against. The projected number of students to be moved was about 2,000.

Demographics
In the 2014–2015 school year the district had 48,126 students, 1,467 students (3%) higher than the enrollment of the previous school year. There were a total of 5,634 English Language Learners (ELL) students as part of the overall student enrollment for 2014–2015, and that had increased by about 1,200 (28%). Most of the additional students for 2014-2015 were Hispanic, and of them, most were Honduran. According to ELL director Karina Castillo the East Bank had more of the new students than the West Bank.

Academic performance
James K. Glassman of The Atlantic wrote in 1978 that the school system was of the same quality as that of New Orleans even though Jefferson Parish was wealthier than New Orleans; Glassman described Jefferson Parish as "one of the most poorly run rich counties in the United States."

In October 2009, the release of annual school performance scores by the Louisiana Department of Education revealed that Jefferson Parish's public school system posted its largest-ever increase in performance score, to 78.4, though the performance score remained significantly below the state average of 91. In 2011, according to state accountability rules, the district made a "D" grade. This increased to a "C" in 2012, and then a "B" on 2013, giving it the 36th highest score of the school districts in the state. This score applies to the 2012–2013 school year. Its Louisiana performance score was 85.9 of 150. In 2014 it continued having a "B" ranking, with its performance being 87.2 of 150.

By 2012 the district established a policy stating that if a principal does not reach academic goals in three years, the principal will be removed. In 2012 15 principals lost their jobs over this policy.

Operations
As of 2014 teachers who have large numbers of bilingual students and are fluent in either Spanish, Arabic, and Vietnamese may receive a $3,000 annual stipend and/or a $2,000 signing bonus.

Previously the district had an administrative building in Marrero for people living in the West Bank of the parish. It was proposed for closure and consolidation into the Harvey headquarters in 2012.

The teachers previously had a collective bargaining agreement but it expired in 2012. The school board did not wish to renew it. The Teacher Voice Advisory Council was created in 2013.

 2012 closures
They were:
 Ralph J. Bunche Accelerated Academy for High School Preparation - (Unincorporated, Metairie) - The closure plan called for the students to be moved to Bonnabel High.
 Homedale Elementary School - (Unincorporated, Harvey) - The closure plan called for students to be moved to McDonogh No. 26 Elementary.
 Joseph S. Maggiore, Sr. Elementary School - (Unincorporated, Metairie) - Area parents advocated for keeping Maggiore open. The closure plan called for students to be moved to Clancy, Green Park, and Woods.
 Kate Middleton Elementary School - Gretna - The closure plan called for some students to be moved to Hart Elementary and others to be moved to Terrytown Elementary. In the 2011–2012 school year, Middleton had 370 students. Some parents criticized the closure plans as the school district stated that 350 was the minimum enrollment for an optimally-run elementary school, but the district still chose to close Middleton. The school's performance under Louisiana accountability laws declined after 2008, with the 2010–2011 score being a "D−".
 Norbert Rillieux Elementary School - (Unincorporated, Waggaman) - The closure plan called for the students to be moved to Cherbonnier Elementary. In 2011 the school had 208 students.
 Bonella A. St. Ville Accelerated Academy - (Unincorporated, Harvey) - Initially Elm Grove Elementary School, it served as a neighborhood elementary campus, and in the pre-1970s racially segregated period it was for black children. It was renamed after formal principal Bonella A. St. Ville. It was later converted into an alternative middle school for students who were academically behind their peers. It had 144 students in 2012. The closure plan called for the program to be moved to Ehret High. There were area residents arguing that it instead should go back to being a neighborhood elementary school.
 Waggaman School - The closure plan called for the program to be moved to West Bank Community School.
