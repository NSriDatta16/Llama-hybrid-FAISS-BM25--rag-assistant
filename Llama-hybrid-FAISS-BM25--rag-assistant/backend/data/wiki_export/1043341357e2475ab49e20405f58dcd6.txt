Mariska (born Anna Maria Rahikainen; 19 February 1979 in Helsinki) is a Finnish rapper, singer and songwriter. She writes her songs by herself, and the lyrics often deal with relationships, male chauvinism and politics.

Biography
Mariska began to play piano in Sibelius-Akatemia at the age of 7. She soon changed her style to punk and joined a punk-band called Oheisvasara. Mariska moved to London in 1998 to study Latin and old Greek in university.

Career as a rap artist

She returned to Finland in 2002 and her first album Toisin sanoen was released the same year. Mariska's second album, Memento mori was released in 2004, and the third, Suden hetki followed in August 2005. The latter two were nominated for Emma Awards.

Mariska and Pahat Sudet
In 2010 Mariska switched genre teaming up with Jaakko Jakku, Klaus Suominen and Luis Herrero. The new formation was named Mariska & Pahat Sudet. The self-titled album Mariska & Pahat Sudet was released in May 2010 and characterized as punk jazz and blues pop spiritual.

In recently dying her hair red Mylène Farmer-style, she enhanced her image for the release of her 2012 album Kukkurukuu, which has thus far spawned the singles "Liekki", "Kukkurukuu" and "Kuolema on kalamies".

Career as a pop singer
After Mariska & Pahat Sudet dissolved in 2013 Mariska began working on her current solo career as a pop singer. She released a single Itserakkausjuttuu in 2015 and the subsequent album Matador in 2016. In 2018 she released a poem collection titled Määt ja Muut – Runoja eläimistä ja ihmisistä and in 2019 her second album as a solo pop singer titled Mariska. In 2020 Mariska participated in the 11th season of popular Finnish music reality show Vain elämää.
