McKay died of a brain haemorrhage 30 hours after his second fight against Byrne. The news of his death was greeted in his native Scotland by rioting in which several died. He is buried in churchyard in the village of Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. The following epitaph is engraved on his tombstone.

"Strong and athletic was my frame
Far from my native home I came
And bravely fought with Simon Byrne
Alas, but never to return.
Stranger take warning from my fate
Lest you should rue your case too late
If you have ever fought before
Determine now to fight no more"
