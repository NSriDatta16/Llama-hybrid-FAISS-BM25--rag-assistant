Jabi of Silla (r. 458–479, died 479), also known by his title Jabi Maripgan, was the 20th ruler of the Korean kingdom of Silla.  He was the eldest son of King Nulji, and his mother was the daughter of King Silseong.  He married the daughter of Kim Misaheun.

In 474, Goguryeo launched a massive assault on Baekje, Silla's neighbor to the west.  Jabi sent troops to aid Baekje, forming a historic alliance between the two kingdoms which lasted into the 6th century.
