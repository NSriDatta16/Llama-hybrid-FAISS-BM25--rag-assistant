Ticonderoga Publications is an Australian independent publishing house founded by Russell B. Farr in 1996. Currently, Farr and Liz Grzyb continue to run the publication. The publisher specializes in collections of science fiction short stories.

History and current
Ticonderoga Publications was founded by Russell B. Farr in 1996. Co-partner in Ticonderoga Publications is editor Liz Grzyb. The publisher initially specialized in collections of science fiction short stories. Between 1996 and 1999, it published collections by Steven Utley, Sean Williams, Stephen Dedman, and other writers.  According to Peek, "Under Farr, Ticonderoga Publications gathered a reputation for producing sturdy, thick-papered, elegant collections."

Ticonderoga Publications suspended their production of books in 1999. This was due to the Australian GST (Goods and Services Tax) that raised the price of books by ten percent, with the editor concentrating on his Ticonderoga Online webzine instead.

In 2005, Ticonderoga Publications announced resumed publication with two new anthologies released in late 2006-early 2007. In 2006, it published Troy, a collection by Simon Brown. In 2007, it published the Ditmar Award-winning Fantastic Wonder Stories, edited by Russell B. Farr.

Ticonderoga Publications has published several anthologies, including The Workers' Paradise (2007) edited by Russell B. Farr and Nick Evans, Australia's first SF anthology to explore the future of work; Scary Kisses (2010) edited by Liz Grzyb, Australia's first paranormal romance anthology; and Belong (2010) edited by Russell B. Farr, twenty-three stories of interstellar immigration with writers from Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, USA, UK, and New Zealand.

In 2008, Ticonderoga Publications published Magic Dirt: the best of Sean Williams, winner of the inaugural Aurealis Award for Best Collection.

From 2010 to 2015, Ticonderoga Press published The Year's Best Australian Fantasy and Horror series, edited by Liz Grzyb and Talie Helene.

The West Australian newspaper has described Ticonderoga Publications as one of "the most important micro presses in Australia".
