One of the many Bismarck towers built in the former German Empire (Kaiserreich) is located in Szczecin (Gocław), now in north-western Poland (known as Stettin in German).

History 
Its construction began relatively late, in 1913, and it was only finished in 1921. The total construction cost of the -tall tower was approximately 200,000 German Papiermarks.

The tower is located on top of a small hill and is surrounded by a small wood, although the surrounding area is now generally industrial. It is approximately  from the city centre, close to a tram terminus. 

Although one can visit the tower, the main entry way is fully sealed off, as are all windows, making entry impossible. It is also in need of restoration.
