Wilhelm Piec (born Wilhelm Pietz; 2 November 1915 – 4 April 1954) was a Polish soccer forward player.

Wilhelm was one of the best players of interwar Poland. Together with his older (and more famous) brother Ryszard Piec, they represented Naprzód Lipiny - a small team from a small hamlet of Lipiny, which never managed to qualify to the Polish Soccer League, but which played a significant role in interwar Polish soccer.

He was part of Poland's squad at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches. Piec represented Poland in 4 games. He went to the 1938 FIFA World Cup in France, but did not play in the legendary Poland - Brazil game which ended 5-6 (5 June 1938, Strasbourg). During the war he continued playing in Naprzód, which was forced to change its name to TuS Lipine. After the war, in 1946-47, he played in AKS Chorzów.
