VePlus is a subscription channel owned by Cisneros Media and serves as an updated version of their previous channel, Venevisión Continental. It was also known as Novelísima, Ve Plus TV and V Mas TV, a subsidiary of Grupo Cisneros. VePlus incorporates much of the programming from Venevisión Continental and Novelísima, while also producing its own content in Venezuela and Miami.

History

Venevisión Continental was originally launched as a cable television station on August 28, 2000. It provided entertainment programs, news, talk shows, and soap operas, catering to Spanish-speaking audiences in Venezuela, Latin America, and Europe as the international signal of Venevisión. The channel ceased its broadcasts in July 2008. It was available on DirecTV channel 774 until September 2006 and was owned by Venezuela's Venevisión Canal.

In December 2007, the Cisneros Group initiated a pilot project called Venevisión Novelísima Plus in Venezuela. Recognizing its success and large viewership, Venevisión Continental was relaunched in June 2008 under the name Novelísima. The channel focused on soap operas, telenovelas, Latin entertainment, talk shows, and contests, while excluding opinion, politics, and news media.

On July 18, 2012, the signals of "Novelísima" and "Venevisión Plus Dominicana" were merged to create "Ve Plus TV." In 2017, the channel was rebranded as VePlus.
