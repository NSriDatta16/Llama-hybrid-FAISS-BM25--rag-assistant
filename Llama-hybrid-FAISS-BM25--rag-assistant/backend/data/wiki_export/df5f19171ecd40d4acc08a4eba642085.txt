Berria (Basque: News) is the only daily newspaper published wholly in the Basque language and which can be read in the entirety of the Basque country. It was created after the closure of the previous Basque language newspaper, Egunkaria, by the Spanish government, after being accused of having ties with ETA.      

Berria is published daily, with the exception of Monday. The first issue was released on 21 June 2003. The newspaper's headquarters is in Andoain, Gipuzkoa, in the autonomous Basque region, Euskadi, in northern Spain. It also has offices in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Pamplona, Bilbao and Bayonne.
