He is an Eagle Scout and has been honored as an adult with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, the Silver Buffalo Award, the Silver Antelope Award, and the Silver Beaver Award; he is also a former Chairman of the National Order of the Arrow Committee, in which post he was succeeded by Bradley Haddock.

Congress 

His tenure in Congress was defined by significant accomplishments such as increasing Indiana's share of transportation funding, increasing the investment in the US military, saving the historic downtown Federal Building in Terre Haute, Indiana, and serving on the House Judiciary Committee that introduced the articles of impeachment for President Bill Clinton.

His time in Congress was marred by several unfortunate circumstances, including finding a dead body outside his apartment building, being mugged at an Arlington, Virginia subway station, and having his apartment burglarized. His successor, Brian Kerns, who served as Pease’s chief of staff during his time in Congress, speculated that these incidents may have contributed to Pease’s decision to retire from office.

Later career 
After leaving Congress, Pease became senior vice president of government relations for Rolls-Royce plc North America, later becoming a consultant for the company.

Pease has been an active supporter of the American college fraternity movement, serving as national president of his fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, receiving the fraternity's Loyalty Award at the 2016 Convention, and as a two-term president of the North American Interfraternity Conference and winner of its highest honor, the Gold Medal.

In 2018, he was named chairman of the board of trustees at Indiana State University.
