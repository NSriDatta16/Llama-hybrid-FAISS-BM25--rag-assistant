There are three meanings for this term.

Generally, Main Street Republicans are the party's small-town, rural, and small-business supporters, generally perceived as being more socially conservative than the big-business "Wall Street" faction, which is largely perceived as being predominantly in favor of reduced taxation and business regulation; and as either unconcerned or openly hostile to frequently held "Main Street" positions in opposition to abortion, gay rights, and similar issues of major concern.
