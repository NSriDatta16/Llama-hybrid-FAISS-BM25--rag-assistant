The House of Lazarević (,  Lazarevići / Лазаревићи, ) was a Serbian medieval royal family, which ruled Moravian Serbia and the Serbian Despotate.

The dynasty began with Lazar Hrebeljanović, son of Pribac Hrebeljanović-a noble at the court of Dušan the Mighty. Lazar married Milica, supposedly a member of the reigning Nemanjić dynasty, and was later given the title "Knez" by Serbian Emperor Uroš the Weak. He gained lands in Central Serbia and through his ties with the Nemanjićs he became the regent of Moravian Serbia. In the Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire, Lazar was killed and Serbia became a vassal state, leading to the end of Serbian sovereignty.
