Daehang-no () is a area in Seoul north of the Han River within Jongno and Seodaemun districts.

Formerly known as Sunggyo-bang (), it received its current name after the 1.1 km six lane road from Hyehwa-dong rotary to Ihwa-dong crossroad was designated as a "street of culture" on May 5, 1985.

Daehang-no is the street from the crossroad of 79–1, Jongno 5-ga, Jongno District, to Hyehwa-dong rotary, 132, Hyehwa-dong.

History 
King Taejo relocated Sungkyunkwan to the current location on Daehang-no, after the founding of the Joseon dynasty. This gave Daehang-no its former name, "Sunggyo-bang", meaning "high respect for teaching".

During the Japanese occupation, Keijō Imperial University was founded in this area. The university was later merged with other colleges to form the prestigious Seoul National University.
