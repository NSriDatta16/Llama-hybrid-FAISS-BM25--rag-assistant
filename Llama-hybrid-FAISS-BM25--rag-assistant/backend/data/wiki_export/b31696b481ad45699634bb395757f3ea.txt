The Return of the Drifter is the debut studio album by English rapper Jehst, originally released in 2002 via Low Life Records. The album was produced almost entirely by Jehst, with the exception of the tracks "Alcoholic Author" and "Staircase to Stage" which were produced by Harry Love.

Since its release, The Return of the Drifter has become known as a classic in the UK Hip-Hop scene and is widely regarded as one of the most important UK Hip-Hop albums of all time. It is commonly accepted to include some of Jehst's finest music in terms of both lyrical content and production work. It features largely acclaimed UK Hip-Hop classics such as "High Plains Anthem", "1979", "Staircase to Stage" and "People Under The Weather", which features Asaviour, a longtime collaborator of Jehst (both spent their teens as close friends in Huddersfield).
