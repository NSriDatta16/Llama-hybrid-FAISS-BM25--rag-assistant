Tuck is a surname, borne by many people and institutions. The name is related to Tucker and Tooke.

Tuck is a masculine name and sometimes nickname given to someone bearing the name of Tucker in many countries. The English surname Tuck is of patronymic origin, being one of those names that was based on the first name of the father. During the Middle Ages when the systems of surnames first developed, it was inevitable that children in the community would be known by their father’s name. In this case the name literally means "The son of Toke", Toke being a medieval personal name. In the Domesday Book of 1086 this first name was more generally rendered as Toka, hence this document mentions a "liber homo Stingandi Toka Francigine" (Toka the Frenchman).

Records of this surname in England date back to the fourteenth century. The poll tax returns of Yorkshire, for example, mention a Thomas Tuke and a Johannes Tokson. In 1526 the Registers of the University of Oxford refer to one of their students as "Nicholas Toke, or Tocke, or Tuke" which indicates the various ways in which this surname could be rendered.

Tuck is also linked further back than the fourteenth century as originating from Nordic, Icelandic and other island countries. This name has many variations through many different cultures that began between the 15th and 16th century. Included are Tuke, Tucka, Toke and Tuske. However, Tuck was primarily a name that began in Viking royalty and what was commonly referred to then as Cosmater as one of the last known Nordic leaders before the disbandment in 1372 A.D. Reaching the medieval periods in England it became more common as travel became less useful to the Nordic. Most of the remaining Nordic travelers found settlement in the English provinces and ended the Cosmatsership.
