Mass graves were later exhumed in an attempt to conceal crimes.

Economy 

Ferronikeli mine and smelter operation provided jobs for more than 2,000 people at the peak of its production in 1988. As of 2019, it was "the largest exporter in Kosovo, accounting for about 40% of the country's exports". While the presence of significant ore deposits was noticed as long ago as 1958, the plant was commissioned in 1984 while the Socialist FRY was in power. The deposits are of the lateritic type. Heavy damages were inflicted on the facility during the 1999 conflict, leaving it inoperable. Ferronikeli was privatised after the war by Alferon Management. Since July 2018 the most recent owners are called Balfin Group, who took over the project after it had been idle for four months. The plant contributes to the infrastructure of the municipality with power, including water supply and an electric grid. Four nickel mines operate in the region: Čikatovo, Dushkaja, Gllavica and Suke.

Two quarries at Korroticë e Ulët and Çikatovë e Vjeter have become operational since the conflict.

A major development is the building of the Trade Centre, which was completed by mid-2004. The municipality played a central role in the whole process by co-ordinating the financing, construction and management of the project. The Trade Centre contains 134 shops and offices for small businesses.
