Harry Smith Collection
The library's origins date back to the early 1950s when Harry Smith (British horticultural photographer) starting building up a catalogue of images, mostly for supply to seed houses and to illustrate magazines such as Amateur Gardening and Garden News as well as books. In the period between 1950-1960s there were not many horticultural photographers working in colour, Valerie Finnis was one of the most respected- she was a contributor to Royal Horticultural Society magazines. Derek Fell also a photographer, originally worked with the 'eminent' Harry Smith during this period as PR executive with Hurst Seeds and lists him as an influence. It was not until after his death that the Harry Smith Collection was formally founded in 1974 by Dick Robinson and Anthony Huxley.

The Harry Smith Collection was an image supplier to the Royal Horticultural Society Herbarium image collection.
