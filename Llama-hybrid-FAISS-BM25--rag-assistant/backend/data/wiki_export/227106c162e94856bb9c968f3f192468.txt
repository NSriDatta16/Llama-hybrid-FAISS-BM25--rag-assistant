Elharar [or El-harar] is a Jewish surname classically found among Moroccan Jews. Harar, "حرر", in Judeo-Moroccan Arabic means, "liberate". The Moroccan Arabic is different from the Arabic spoken in the Middle East. Therefore, the prefix "El" in the name Elharar is similar to the word "the" in Arabic, "ال" which is pronounced "al". Together, in Moroccan Arabic, the name Elharar means "The Liberators".

This name comes from the history of the condition of Jews living in Morocco. Barbary pirates would kidnap and then ransom off their captives. Families and communities would buy the freedom of these kidnapped individuals. The families that would buy back the kidnapped individuals were given the surname "The Liberators". Therefore, the name "Elharar".

Other derivations of the name depend on the movement of individuals but may include: Lhrar and Lehrer
