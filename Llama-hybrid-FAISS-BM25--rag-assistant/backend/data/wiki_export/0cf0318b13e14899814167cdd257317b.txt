Egan Inoue (, born June 4, 1965) is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner, former mixed martial artist and racquetball competitor.  A two-time International Racquetball Federation (IRF) World Champion, Inoue is a two-time Brazilian jiu-jitsu world champion in colored belts, the first non-Brazilian to win a gold medal at the World Jiu Jitsu Championship.

Early life 
Egan Inoue was born on 4 June 1965, in Honolulu, Hawaii, in a family of Japanese descent. He started practicing Shotokan Karate from a young age taught by his grandfather. He would later take up Wing Chun Kung Fu, Taekwondo, Judo, Hapkido, and Jujutsu. At 16 he started practicing racquetball becoming state champion by the time he turned 18.

Racquetball career 
Inoue played professional racquetball on the International Racquetball Tour, winning two tournaments, and finishing in the top 10 ranked players four times: 1986–87 to 1988–89 and 1990–91. His record on the IRT is 84–63. Inoue briefly ascended to be the No. 1 ranked player on tour in December 1990 before finishing the season ranked 6th. But Inoue's racquetball career is highlighted by two World Championships. His first came in 1986 in Orlando, Florida, when he defeated Canadian Roger Harripersad in the final, 15–2, 7–15, and 15–7. Four years later, in 1990, Inoue defeated fellow American Tim Doyle in the final, 13–15, 15–13, 15–5, to win his second World Championship. In 1989, Inoue had a 50 percent ownership in E-Force, a racquetball equipment company. In 1993, he sold his stake in E-Force and returned to jiu jitsu.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu career 
Inoue started training Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) in the late 1980s at Relson Gracie's academy in the late 1980s before joining the Machado academy where he earned his purple and brown belts. In 1996, Inoue won the World Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Championship in the blue belt division. He was the first American to win the title. He then returned to Brazil in 1997 and won the World Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Championship in the absolute purple belt division. Inoue later joined John Lewis academy where he was promoted to black belt. Inoue holds a 4th degree black belt in Jiu Jitsu.

Mixed martial arts career 
Inoue went on to fight professionally in MMA. He retired in 2003 but came out of retirement on May 5, 2008, beating Hans Marrero by TKO at a X-1 – Legends, an MMA show held at the Neil S. Blaisdell Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Inoue's MMA record is 13 wins with 8 losses. He has opened up three MMA training schools in the state of Hawaii. Inoue's MMA career led him to fights in Pride, Shooto, Superbrawl and Luminex Cup.  He enjoyed a successful career with five world championship titles.

His younger brother Enson Inoue went on to become the first ever Heavyweight Champion of Shooto.
