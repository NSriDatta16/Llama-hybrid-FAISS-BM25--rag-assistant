Food additives are substances added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste, appearance, or other qualities.

Purposes

Additives are used for many purposes but the main uses are:

Acids  Food acids are added to make flavors "sharper", and also act as preservatives and antioxidants. Common food acids include vinegar, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, folic acid, fumaric acid, and lactic acid.
Acidity regulators  Acidity regulators are used to change or otherwise control the acidity and alkalinity of foods.
Anticaking agents  Anticaking agents keep powders such as milk powder from caking or sticking.
Antifoaming agents  Antifoaming agents reduce or prevent foaming in foods.
Antioxidants  Antioxidants such as vitamin C act as preservatives by inhibiting the effects of oxygen on food, and can be beneficial to health.
Bulking agents  Bulking agents such as starch are additives that increase the bulk of a food without affecting its nutritional value.
Food coloring  Colorings are added to food to replace colors lost during preparation, or to make food look more attractive.
Color retention agents  In contrast to colorings, color retention agents are used to preserve a food's existing color.
Emulsifiers  Emulsifiers allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an emulsion, as in mayonnaise, ice cream, and homogenized milk.
Flavors  Flavors are additives that give food a particular taste or smell, and may be derived from natural ingredients or created artificially.
Flavor enhancers  Flavor enhancers enhance a food's existing flavors. They may be extracted from natural sources (through distillation, solvent extraction, maceration, among other methods) or created artificially.
Flour treatment agents  Flour treatment agents are added to flour to improve its color or its use in baking.
Glazing agents Glazing agents provide a shiny appearance or protective coating to foods.
Humectants  Humectants prevent foods from drying out.
Tracer gas Tracer gas allow for package integrity testing to prevent foods from being exposed to atmosphere, thus guaranteeing shelf life.
Preservatives  Preservatives prevent or inhibit spoilage of food due to fungi, bacteria and other microorganisms.
Stabilizers  Stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents, like agar or pectin (used in jam for example) give foods a firmer texture. While they are not true emulsifiers, they help to stabilize emulsions.
Sweeteners  Sweeteners are added to foods for flavoring. Sweeteners other than sugar are added to keep the food energy (calories) low, or because they have beneficial effects for diabetes mellitus and tooth decay.
Thickeners  Thickeners are substances which, when added to the mixture, increase its viscosity without substantially modifying its other properties.

Caffeine and other GRAS (generally recognized as safe) additives such as sugar and
salt are not required to go through the regulation process.
