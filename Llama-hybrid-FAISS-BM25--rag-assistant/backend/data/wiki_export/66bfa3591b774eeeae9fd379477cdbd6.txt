The Racquet Club of Chicago is a private social club and athletic club within the Gold Coast Historic District.  The classical revival building was designed by architect Andrew Rebori, constructed in 1923. It is a contributing structure within the National Register Gold Coast Historic District.

The Racquet Club currently features squash courts (two North American doubles and one International singles), two racquets courts, and one real tennis court restored in 2012. The racquets courts are the world's westernmost active venue for that sport.

The Racquet Club has been renovated, and where there once were two Squash singles courts, of the "American" style dimensions, there now is one court of the "International" dimensions.
