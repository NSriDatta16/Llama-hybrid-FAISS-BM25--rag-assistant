Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew is a non-fiction book by English writer Bernard Hare.  It is an account of Britain's dispossessed youth and inner city wastelands.

Hare was on society's margins, living on a rough estate in Leeds, England and with a liking for drink and drugs â€“ so he knew what life in the underclass was like in 1990s Britain. However, even he was shocked when he met Urban Grimshaw, an illiterate, drug-using 12-year-old. 
"If it's one of the functions of art to take you places and show you things you wouldn't otherwise have access to, then Urban Grimshaw is a masterpiece."

A British drama film, Urban and the Shed Crew starring Richard Armitage and Anna Friel is to be released.
