Dallam School is a mixed, 11-18 secondary school with academy status, located in Milnthorpe, Cumbria, England. It was founded in 1984 through the merger of Heversham Grammar School (established in 1613) and Milnthorpe Secondary School.

History
Heversham Grammar School was founded and endowed on 24 January 1619/20, by Edward Wilson, Kt (1557-1653), of Nether Levens, who also owned Heversham Hall.  It occupied the site known in recent years as Old School, above and behind the village church, on Heversham Head.  The building is now a private house.  The present ivy-clad Boarding House and Big School (formerly the school hall) date from the 1880s.

Milnthorpe Secondary School was founded in 1951 and, after occupying many different buildings around the village, moved to Dallam's current location in 1968, complete with Community Centre.
