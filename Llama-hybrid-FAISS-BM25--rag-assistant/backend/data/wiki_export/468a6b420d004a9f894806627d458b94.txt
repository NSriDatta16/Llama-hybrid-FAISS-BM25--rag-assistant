Hedrum is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1988. The area is now part of Larvik Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Nanset (from 1978-1988; prior to that, the municipal administration was located in the village of Hedrum where the Hedrum Church is located). Other villages in Hedrum include Gjone, Kvelde, Skinmo, and Verningen.

Hedrum municipality was located in the Lågendalen valley, the lower part of the valley that follows the river Numedalslågen. The valley is relatively flat and dominated by agricultural areas. The valley is surrounded by wooded hills which rise up towards  tall mountain peaks. Among other things, the area is known for potato cultivation and fishing.

General information
The parish of Hedrum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). Over the years, there have been many municipal border adjustments. On 1 January 1875, an area of Hedrum (population: 46) became part of the neighboring town of Larvik. On 1 January 1878, an area of Hedrum (population: 61) became part of the neighboring municipality of Andebu. On 1 January 1891, an area of Tjølling municipality (population: 11) became part of Hedrum. In 1937, an area of Hedrum (population: 69) became part of the neighboring town of Larvik. In 1948, an area of Hedrum (population: 296) became part of the neighboring town of Larvik.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, two border adjustments were made in Hedrum. One area of Hedrum (population: 16) was transferred to Siljan Municipality (in Telemark county) and the adjacent Bakke area (population: 75) was transferred to Porsgrunn Municipality (also in Telemark county). On 1 January 1968, the unpopulated Svartangen area of Siljan was transferred to Hedrum (and Vestfold county). On 1 January 1974 the unpopulated Tagtvedt area of Hedrum was transferred to the neighboring town of Larvik. On 1 January 1983, the unpopulated Bergan area of Hedrum was transferred to the neighboring Lardal municipality. On 1 January 1986, part of the Åsveien 3 property in Hedrum was transferred to the neighboring town of Larvik. On 9 January 1987 an unpopulated area in northern Hedrum was transferred to Lardal municipality.

On 1 January 1988, the municipality was dissolved as part of a major municipality merger which consolidated the municipalities of Brunlanes (population: 8,138), Hedrum (population: 10,449), and Tjølling (population: 7,878) with the towns of Larvik (population: 8,045) and Stavern (population: 2,538) to create a new, much larger Larvik Municipality with a population of 37,048 people.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Hedrum farm () since the first Hedrum Church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of the word  which means "heath" or "moorland". The last element is  which means "home" or "abode".

Coat of arms
The coat of arms was granted on 18 November 1966. The official blazon is "Vert, a bend wavy argent" (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a wavy diagonal line. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The green color in the field symbolizes the importance of the local forests and the wavy line was chosen to symbolize the river Numedalslågen which flows through the municipality. The arms were designed by D. Krohn-Holm, Jr. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

Churches

Hedrum Church (Hedrum Kirke) is a medieval era church that was the main church for the municipality. It is one of several ancient stone churches within a vicinity which also includes churches at Hem, as well as Efteløt and Hedenstad in Buskerud. Other churches in Hedrum include Kvelde Church and Hvarnes Church. 

Hedrum Church was built of stone around 1100. The church celebrated its 950-year anniversary in 2010. The church has a rectangular nave, square choir and apse. Building Archaeological studies show that the apse is added later. The structure was extended by four meters in 1666. The west part with the portal and door openings are from after the Reformation. Hedrum Church has a number of tombstones, which cover large parts of the floor of the church. Hedrum Church cemetery is clearly visible from traffic arteries on both sides of Numedalslågen. Some of the graves are believed to pre-date the introduction of Christianity  confirming the supposition that ancient pagan cult sites were chosen as the venue for the earlier churches.
