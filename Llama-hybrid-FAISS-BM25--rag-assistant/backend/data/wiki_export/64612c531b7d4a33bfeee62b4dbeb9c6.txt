In the Eye of the Storm is the first solo album by former Supertramp member Roger Hodgson. Some of its songs (e.g. "Hooked on a Problem" and "Only Because of You") were initially written and recorded for Supertramp's previous album ...Famous Last Words..., but not released.

Overview
The album's first single was the four-minute edit of "Had a Dream (Sleeping with the Enemy)", which peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100. The follow-up single, a four-minute edit of "In Jeopardy", was a minor hit, peaking at number 30 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart but failing to crack the Billboard Hot 100. The album itself was only moderately successful, stalling at number 46 on the Billboard album chart and only reaching number 70 on the UK Albums Chart. It performed far better in Canada, going platinum within a month of its release. It also enjoyed success in Australia, hitting number 23 on the album charts as "Had a Dream (Sleeping with the Enemy)" peaked at number 21. "Lovers in the Wind" became a hit in the Philippines.

A sticker affixed to the cover cellophane of the album name-dropped both the album's two singles and "Hooked on a Problem", indicating that "Hooked" may have been intended for a single release at some point.

Reception

The album received a positive review from AllMusic, who stated that the album's key quality is that Hodgson plays the vast majority of the instruments himself. They also noted that though the music itself lacks any progressive rock elements, "The spirit of traditional progressive rock experimentation is alive on this album; five of the seven songs exceed six minutes."
