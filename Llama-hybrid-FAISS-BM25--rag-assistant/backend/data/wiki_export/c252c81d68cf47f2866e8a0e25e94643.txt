Description
Maple Ridge Wind Farm, which achieved full operation in 2006, is a facility with 195 Vestas model V82 1.65 MW wind turbines. The Danish model machines were shipped in parts by sea to the United States, and via the St. Lawrence Seaway to Lake Ontario, where they were unloaded at the Oswego Port Authority. They were transported by numerous trucks to the area of the farm near Lowville, New York.

Each turbine tower is  tall. Each turbine has blades  long, which added to the hub diameter gives a rotor diameter of . Collectively, the turbines can produce a maximum of nearly 322 MW. 

Maple Ridge Wind Farm became fully operational in June 2006.
