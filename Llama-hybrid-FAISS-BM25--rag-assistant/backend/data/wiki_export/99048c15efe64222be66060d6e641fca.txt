Suspending operations

On September 28, Idaho Sports Properties suspended operations in part due to a major withdrawal from the Burn's majority owner. The other owners Texas AF2 Holdings also agreed to withdraw funds from the Burn. Boise was invited to join the newly formed Arena Football 1, but even if the funding had gone forward, there would be no guarantee that Boise would join the league.
