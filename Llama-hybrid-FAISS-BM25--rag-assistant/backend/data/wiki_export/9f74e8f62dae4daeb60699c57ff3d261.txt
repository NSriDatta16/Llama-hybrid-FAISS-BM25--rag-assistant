Waccasassa Bay Preserve State Park is a  salt marsh that stretches from Cedar Key to Yankee Town, and is only accessible by boat. It includes the part of Gulf Hammock wetlands area that is closest to the Gulf.

Some access points are from County Road 40 in Yankee Town, by boat down the Waccasassa River from the community of Gulf Hammock, and Cedar Key.

It is the home to numerous species of saltwater fish and shellfish, as well as many endangered and threatened species, including manatees, alligators, bald eagles and black bears. The bay is also the only known habitat for a highly endangered species of rodent, the Florida salt marsh vole (Microtus dukecampbelli).
