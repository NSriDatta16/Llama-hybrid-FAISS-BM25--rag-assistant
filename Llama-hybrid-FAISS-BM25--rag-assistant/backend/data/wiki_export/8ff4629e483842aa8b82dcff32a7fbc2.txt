Winner Takes All is a BBC Books original novel written by Jacqueline Rayner and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was published on 19 May 2005, alongside The Clockwise Man and The Monsters Inside. It features the Ninth Doctor, Rose Tyler, Jackie Tyler and Mickey Smith.

Plot
Upon finding that her mum has just won the lottery, Rose decides to visit Earth.

Rose and the Doctor go to visit Mickey, who tells them that everyone is playing Death to Mantodeans, the game that is complementary with the console. Interested, the Doctor starts playing it, while Rose goes out.

The Doctor and Robert are again interrupted by Quevvils calling to find out why the game isn't being played as expected.  The door explodes before they are able to get the controlled Quevvil to respond, so the Doctor has to go back to pretending to play.  He and Robert are taken to another room.  All of the other prisoners are brought into the room as well, and the Doctor is told that one will be killed every time he deviates from the game.

Rose makes it to the center of the game, and the Quevvils get ready to teleport, but the Doctor has Mickey send a signal that disrupts it, which atomizes all the Quevvils. Rose finds that she can move and talk on her own again.

Continuity
Rose tells the Doctor 'You've reversed teleportation before,' a reference to "The End of the World".
Mention is made of Rose being gone for a year, and Mickey being a suspect in her disappearance, a reference to "Aliens of London".
The Doctor's dislike of guns in this book anticipates his comments in "The Doctor Dances" about destroying the weapons factory on Villengard.
One of Mickey's video games is called Bad Wolf.
