Juan Fernando Ortega (born March 2, 1957) is a singer-songwriter in contemporary Christian music. He is noted both for his interpretations of many traditional hymns and songs, such as "Give Me Jesus",  "Be Thou My Vision" and "Praise to the Lord, the Almighty", and for writing clear and easily understood songs such as "This Good Day".

Biography
Ortega was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico, near the banks of the Rio Grande. He started learning piano at eight years of age. Through his father's work with the United States Department of State, he also spent time in Ecuador and Barbados. His family lived in Chimayó, New Mexico, for eight generations, a legacy cited as an influence on his music.

Ortega graduated from Valley High School and the University of New Mexico, where he received his bachelor's degree in music education. He is a member and former worship leader at an Anglican church in Albuquerque.

It is from his heritage and classical training at the University of New Mexico that Ortega derives his sound, embracing country, classical, Celtic, Latin American, world, modern folk and rustic hymnody.
