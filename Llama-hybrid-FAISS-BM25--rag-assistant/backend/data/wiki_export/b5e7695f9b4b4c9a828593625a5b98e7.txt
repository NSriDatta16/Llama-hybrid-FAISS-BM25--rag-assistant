Lance Corporal Richard Allen Anderson (16 April 1948 â€“ 24 August 1969) was a United States Marine who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions above and beyond the call of duty in August 1969 during the Vietnam War.

On 24 August 1969, Anderson's platoon was ambushed near Vandegrift Combat Base in Quang Tri Province. Anderson was wounded early in the skirmish but delivered suppressing fire on the North Vietnamese forces. When a militant threw a grenade at the American forces, Anderson threw himself on it and saved the life of another Marine.
