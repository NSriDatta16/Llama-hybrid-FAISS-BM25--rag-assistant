Works

"My Dinner with Ali"
The Sunday Magazine Editors Association judged Miller's first published story, "My Dinner with Ali," the best essay to have appeared in a newspaper magazine in the U.S. in 1989.  A shorter version of "My Dinner with Ali" was nominated by Sport magazine for the 1990 National Magazine Award and was the inspiration for the creation of The Best American Sports Writing (Houghton Mifflin) yearly anthology.  Houghton Mifflin published Miller's story, "The Zen of Muhammad Ali," in the 1994 edition of The Best American Sports Writing.  

"My Dinner with Ali" was selected by David Halberstam as one of the best twenty pieces of sports writing of the 20th Century and has been anthologized in The Best American Sports Writing of the Century (Houghton Mifflin, 1999), in The Muhammad Ali Reader (Ecco Press, 1998), in The Zen of Muhammad Ali and Other Obsessions (Vintage UK, 2002), and in The Beholder's Eye:  America's Finest Personal Journalism (Grove/Atlantic, 2005)."

Approaching Ali

"My Dinner with Ali" was developed into an opera for the Washington National Opera by composer D. J. Sparr.  Along with Pulitzer Prize-winning librettist Mark Campbell, Davis Miller wrote the libretto for the opera, which received its world premiere in June 2013 at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  The title of the opera is Approaching Ali.  Performances of the opera have also been produced by the North Carolina Opera.  In January 2023, Opera Las Vegas premiered a production of Approaching Ali. In April 2023, Opera Louisiane premiered its production of the opera.

The Tao of Muhammad Ali

In July 1994, Miller won the first Creative Nonfiction Writers'Project Grant awarded by the North Carolina Arts Council.  The judge for this grant, which Miller used to complete his first book, The Tao of Muhammad Ali, was novelist and National Public Radio book reviewer Alan Cheuse.

The Tao of Muhammad Ali was published in the United Kingdom in February 1997 by Vintage; it reached number one on several English bestseller lists, including those of the Independent (nine weeks) and of the Observer (seven weeks), as well as bestseller lists in both Ireland and Scotland.  

Miller wrote a radio play of The Tao of Muhammad Ali, which was broadcast in six parts in January 1998 by BBC Radio 4.  The Tao of Muhammad Ali was also a bestseller in Japan (Aoyama Publishing).  It was judged the Best Nonfiction Book of 1997 by book reviewers at several of Japan's largest newspapers, including Yomiuri Shimbun and Asahi Shimbun, among others.  In Italy, it won the thirty-sixth annual Premio Bancarella prize for best sports book published in 1999.

The Tao of Bruce Lee:  a martial arts memoir

Miller's second literary memoir, The Tao of Bruce Lee:  a martial arts memoir, about growing up in western North Carolina, about the author's martial arts experiences, and about the ways he has been influenced by Bruce Lee, was published in August 2000 in hardcover by Crown Publishing.
