As a sports club, it has football schools for junior players and two futsal teams for both men and women, as well as a football trial system to help younger players come through the academy. The club's official supporters' group was the Força Avense.

History

Aves have spent most of their history in the lower leagues, having their debut Primeira Liga season in 1985–86 after winning consecutively the second and third divisions. They returned to the top flight for 2000–01 and 2006–07, again for one season each.

Aves won promotion from LigaPro in 2016–17, finishing as runners-up to Portimonense S.C. under the management of José Mota. On 20 May 2018, the club defeated Sporting CP 2–1 and won their first Taça de Portugal. However, Aves did not qualify for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage because they failed to obtain a license for European competitions. The team were relegated in 2019–20, with five games to play, were marred by financial problems. For these reasons, they and Vitória F.C. were given a further relegation to the third tier.

On 23 September 2020, Aves withdrew before the start of the season. Due to unpaid debts to other clubs, the club received a transfer ban from FIFA, which it sidestepped by founding new entity Clube Desportivo das Aves 1930 in October.
