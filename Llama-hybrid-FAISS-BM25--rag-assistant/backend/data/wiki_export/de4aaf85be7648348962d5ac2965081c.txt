D.P. Todd Secondary School is a public high school in Prince George, British Columbia and is part of School District 57 Prince George.

History
Until school catchment changes in 2010, a third of the students came from outside of the catchment area, and a waiting listed existed for student registration, with enrolment capped at around 750 students. Demographic changes in the city of Prince George led to declining enrolment and a dramatic reduction in transfers despite the inclusion of two new catchment schools. D.P. Todd sees enrolment closer to 625 students in recent years, and has adjusted its programs to better serve at-risk students who often face socio-economic challenges. The school is known for its successful band program, quality instruction, and sense of belonging to a learning community felt by staff and students.
The school is named after Dave Todd, a long-time school SD#57 superintendent. He was known for visiting schools and performing impromptu magic shows.
