History

It was King Denis who, while travelling through the burg (then known as Póvoa d´Álem Sabor, became enchanted by the local landscape and, in 1286, renamed the district Vila Flor. Around 1295, the King ordered the construction of a walled city, consisting of five gates, to protect the fledgling settlement and guard Portuguese interests in the territory.

During the Middle Ages, this bouquet of flowers, as Cabral Adão (1910, in Vila Flor - 1992, in Almada), Vila Flor-born stomatology doctor and writer, once called it, became the home to many fleeing Jewish families, who settled in the territory to start farms and businesses of small industry (such as tanneries and jewelers). King Manuel eventually conferred on the settlement an official charter (foral), later to be reformulated in May 1512. Having favorable, tolerant views towards Portuguese Jews until he decided to marry Infanta Isabella of Aragon, Manuel I agreed to persecute the Jews of Portugal because the anti-Semite parents of his fiancée wouldn't approve that policy. King Manuel expelled the Jews from the municipality, whose remaining peoples or the army were then responsible for destroying the homes of the expelled Jews.
