History

The first written mention of Hořice is from 1143 in the foundation deed of the Strahov Monastery. It was founded on a hill later named Gothard, which was named after the Church of Saint Gotthard founded here in the 12th century. In the 13th century, the settlement was moved to strategically more advantageous place below the hill. In 1365, it was first documented as a market town.

In 1423, Gothard hill was the site of a battle of the Hussite Wars. During the rule of the Smiřický noble family from the mid-16th century to the early 17th century, the town developed rapidly.

In 1846, the town square was damaged by a large fire, which destroyed most of the wooden houses. The wooden buildings were replaced by stone houses, which initiated stone quarrying in many local quarries. This has led to economic development and Hořice turned into a real town. Several factories were established, especially by Jewish entrepreneurs, and sandstone quarrying also developed. In 1882, the railway was built and connected the town with Hradec Králové and Jičín.

The Hořice Castle was created in the Baroque style in the mid-18th century by reconstruction of a Gothic fortress from 14th–15th century.

On the Gothard hill, there is the cemetery Church of Saint Gotthard. The original Romanesque church was rebuilt in the Baroque style in 1783. On the hill there are also remains of an old fortress with the first-ever Czech sculpture of Jan Žižka, former Jewish cemetery, and a sculpture park.
