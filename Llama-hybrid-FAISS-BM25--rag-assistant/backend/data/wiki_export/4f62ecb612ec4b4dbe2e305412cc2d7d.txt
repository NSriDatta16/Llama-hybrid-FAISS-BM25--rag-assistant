Dylan John Jones OBE  (born 1960) is an English journalist and author. He served as editor of the UK version of men's fashion and lifestyle magazine GQ from 1999 to 2021. In June 2023 Jones became the new editor-in-chief of the London Evening Standard which had been without a full-time editor since the previous October.

He has held senior roles with several other publications, including editor of magazines i-D and Arena, and has contributed weekly columns to newspapers The Independent and The Mail on Sunday. Jones has written multiple books.

Education and early career
Jones was born in Ely, Cambridgeshire. He attended Chelsea School of Art and then Saint Martin's School of Art.

GQ
Jones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to the publishing and British fashion industries.

Books
In 2012, Jones wrote three books, When Ziggy Played Guitar: David Bowie and Four Minutes that Shook the World, The Biographical Dictionary of Popular Music and From the Ground Up: U2 360° Tour Official Photobook. The following year, Jones wrote The Eighties: One Day, One Decade, which was published by Preface Publishing in June 2013. The book is partly autobiographical and partly cultural and political history which charts the story of the Eighties through Live Aid in 1985.

Politics
In 2018, Jones wrote for The Guardian, "Though in 2008 I 'came out' as a Tory, today I wouldn't describe myself as a Conservative." He described "the thought of Jacob Rees-Mogg being taken seriously by the electorate" as "frightening" but was more critical of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying his attitude to antisemitism in the party was "insulting". Jones was a prominent supporter of the London Garden Bridge Project. In 2017, he expressed criticism of Jeremy Corbyn and his demeanour during a British GQ cover shoot.
