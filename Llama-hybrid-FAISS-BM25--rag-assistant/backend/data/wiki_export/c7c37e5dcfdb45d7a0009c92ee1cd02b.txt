Composition
"Paid My Dues" was written by Anastacia, LaMenga Kafi, Greg Lawson, and Damon Sharpe, while production was handled by Ric Wake, with additional production by Richie Jones. According to James Salmon from Yahoo! Music, the song is a "typically robust 'go girl' anthem."

Critical reception
Jose F. Promis writing for AllMusic called the song "the soulful, bombastic rocker". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote that "her tenacious attitude on songs like 'Paid My Dues' carve a unique niche for the singer." Aidin Vaziri wrote for Rolling Stone that the song is "grating" and one of Freak of Natures "moments of sheer overkill".

Music video
Directed by Liz Friedlander, the music video for "Paid My Dues" was shot in Los Angeles, California. In the beginning, Anastacia is speaking while being in a virtual mirror. Then you can see Anastacia in a room where she is packing her suitcases. Following this, you see her while she is trying to make her a way but there are many people she must across. Then she is in some kind of a disco, where she successfully tries again to find her way through people, this time to a stage.

When she finally arrives there, she goes through a mirror and is "teleported" to a stage, where she sings the song. In the end she pulls out the electricity cable.
