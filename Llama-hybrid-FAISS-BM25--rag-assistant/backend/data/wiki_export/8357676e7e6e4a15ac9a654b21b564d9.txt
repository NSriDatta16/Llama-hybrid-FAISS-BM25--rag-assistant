Last Tuesday was an American Christian punk band formed in 1999 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States. They played their final show on March 10, 2007. After the announcement from Steve Gee that he would be leaving the band, Last Tuesday no longer had any of its original members.

Discography 
Their last release, Become What You Believe, was very successful since its release on August 15, 2006. The new album showcased a heavier Last Tuesday, with more "screaming" from Carl, and heavier guitar riffs from Ben and Steve.

Their nationally released Mono Vs Stereo debut album, Resolve, was produced by Matthew Thiessen (lead singer of Relient K) and Joe Marlett (Blink 182, Foo Fighters).
