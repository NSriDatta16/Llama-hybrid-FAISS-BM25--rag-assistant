"Come Dig Me Out" is a song by British singer-songwriter Kelly Osbourne. It was planned as the third single to be released from Osbourne's debut album Shut Up, however, the release was cancelled when Osbourne's record label Epic dropped her. Despite this, it was picked as the "Coolest Song of the Week" on 6 June 2004, on the syndicated Little Steven's Underground Garage station. As the song was never released as a single, only promotional copies were made.
