Lords of the Storm is an original novel written by David A. McIntee and based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. The novel features the Fifth Doctor and Turlough.

Plot
The Sontaran-Rutan war has gone on for millennia, and with high costs: Billions dead and whole star systems annihilated. However, victory may be within reach, courtesy of the human colony world of Raghi. When the Doctor and Turlough arrive there, they find a society ruled by a strict caste system. But there is more: people are being infected by a mysterious disease, or vanishing in large numbers while strange objects orbit the sun.

Sequel
The novelisation of Shakedown: Return of the Sontarans by Terrance Dicks, published as part of the Virgin New Adventures, forms a sequel to this novel.
