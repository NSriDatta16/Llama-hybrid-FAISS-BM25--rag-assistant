Bucksburn is a suburb of Aberdeen, Scotland, named after the stream that flows through it. The stream is called Bucks Burn. Bucksburn was formerly a market village before being swallowed up by the spread of the city. The area is bordered by countryside, in particular Kirkhill Forest and the land surrounding Brimmond Hill.

Bucksburn was one of the first established villages in Aberdeen, in the time of the Harrying of Buchan in 1308, when Robert the Bruce was present in Aberdeen.

History

Bucksburn railway station served the area from 1854 to 1956. The line it was on still exists as the Aberdeen–Inverness line.

Bucksburn & District Pipe Band, formed in 1947, has represented Aberdeen internationally and were Champion of Champions in 1998 and 1999 at their grade.
The youth section won the Scottish, British, and World Champions titles in 2008.

When WWI started many soldiers from Bucksburn went. There is a memorial in memory of those who were lost in the war located on Kepplehills Road.

The area is home to P&J Live, which opened in late 2019. P&J Live (also known as TECA) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the suburb of Bucksburn, Aberdeen. Opened in August 2019, it offers a capacity for all types of shows and events from 5,000 to 15,000. Replacing the former Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre (AECC), the 10,000-seat arena is used for concerts and other events. It is the largest indoor arena in Scotland, and the fifth largest arena in the United Kingdom.

There are five parks in Bucksburn: Cloverfield, Inverurie Road, Stoneyton park, Cruikshank park and Brimmond.

Today, "Brighter Bucksburn" works as a sub-group of Bucksburn and Newhills Community Council, to maintain plots and planters throughout the area, and help develop and maintain Cloverfield Park, formerly a waste ground which now has seating, planters and rose-beds. A planned wildflower area to be planted by school pupils was delayed owing to the pandemic.
