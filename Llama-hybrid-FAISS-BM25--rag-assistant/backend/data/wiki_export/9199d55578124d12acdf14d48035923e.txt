COD Meknes (), also called Club Omnisports De Meknès is a Moroccan football club based in Meknes. The club came into being when four local teams; Rachad Meknassi, ASTF, Atlas and Alismailia merged on 21 June 1962. Upon formation CODM Meknès created teams in water polo, basketball, volleyball, handball and most notably football.

History
At the beginning of independence (1955-1956) Al-Ittihad Meknes was dissolved in Meknes to make way for the young team of Rashad Club of Meknes. Unfortunately, the latter could not resist in the first division among the adults, which caused an unprecedented sports crisis in the city of Ismailia. To solve this problem, the officials decided to merge Meknes Olympique Club, Rashad and Al Difaa from Beni Mohamed (a very brilliant team from the third division), but unfortunately this solution did not achieve the desired goal.
