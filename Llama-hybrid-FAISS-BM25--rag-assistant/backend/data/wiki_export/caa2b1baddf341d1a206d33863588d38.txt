Baumberg (also Monheim-Baumberg) is part of the city of Monheim am Rhein in the district of Mettmann in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) at the southern border of Düsseldorf, placed on the eastern bank of the river Rhine. Baumberg consists of an area of about 6 km², with about 14,000 residents in 2023 (one third of the 43,000 in Monheim am Rhein).

History 

Baumberg was first recorded in 1296 as "Boimberg", a village part of the Earldom of Berg. The tower of the Catholic Church St Dionysius which was built in medieval times is left until today whereas the church has been rebuilt according to blueprints of the architect Bernhard Rotterdam in the 1950s. Until the 20th century Baumberg was a rural village, inhabited by mainly fishermen, (goat-)farmers and traditional craftsmen like basket weavers. The eel smokehouse in Baumberg existed from 1857 to 2009 and used fish from its own catch until water pollution in the Rhine became too severe in the 1960s, and then eels from Northern Europe. At the end of the year 1900 about 1,200 people were living in Baumberg and 98 per cent of them were Catholics. The communities of Monheim and Baumberg joined the goat breeding association of the rural district of Solingen in November 1902. The goat, in colloquial German known as “Hippe”, was the “little man's cow”. The district promoted goat breeding, particularly in the small and poor rural community of Baumberg. A special billy goat station was set up on Schallenstrasse, which existed until 1932. 
On September 26, 2004, the Boomberger Hippegarde association unveiled a monument on a traffic island at the junction of Schallenstrasse / Im Sträßchen in memory of the former goat breeding station of the Solingen district. The bronze sculpture is industrially manufactured and shows a billy goat standing on its hind legs. In 1908 the Voluntary Fire Department Baumberg was founded. Baumberg belonged to the Prussian Kreis Solingen (English: rural district of Solingen) from the 19th century to 1929.
Baumberg belonged to the newly established Kreis Solingen-Lennep in 1929 in which was renamed Rhein-Wupper-Kreis in 1931.

2,000 people lived in Baumberg in 1946 after the end of World War II. In 1951 Baumberg became part of southern neighbouring Monheim in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.The Hein Lehmann AG workers' settlement was built between 1952 and 1956. The housing projects by Demag and trade-union-owned building company Neue Heimat boosted population to 5,000 residents in 1965 and to 10,000 in 1969.In 1975, after the municipal reform was carried out, Monheim and Baumberg became districts of Düsseldorf for nearly a year, while the Hitdorf city district of Monheim of  became a city district of Leverkusen. On 6 December 1975 the municipal reform resolution against the independence of Monheim and Baumberg was repealed, but Hitdorf remained a district of Leverkusen. The Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia confirmed this decision by vote on 18 May 1976. On 1 July 1976 Monheim and its city district Baumberg regained their independence and belonged to the district Mettmann (German: Kreis Mettmann). In the eastern part of Baumberg a new quarter with block of flats and terraced houses, the so-called Austrian quarter (German: Österreich-Viertel), was created from the late 1970s to the 1990s.

In 1985, the allotment garden Im Baumberger Feld was created on the border with Düsseldorf-Hellerhof, which has 98 plots.

In 2002, the Knipprather Busch allotment garden association, which was established in 1972, moved to Loheck in Baumberg, because the original location on the former Henkel landfill was to be renovated.

Nowadays Baumberg is mainly a suburban residential area with many commuters to the surrounding towns.
