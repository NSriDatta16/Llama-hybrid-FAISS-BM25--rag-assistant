Before the PIAA instituted the playoff system in 1988, state champions were crowned by state poll, with Easton earning mythical state titles in 1939, 1958, and 1968. Since the advent of the state playoff system, Easton advanced to state semifinals in 1991, 1993, 2003, and 2004 and the state quarterfinals in 2009, and 2010 in 4A, the largest classification in Pennsylvania. As of 2016, Easton will compete in 6A, the largest of the new six school classifications.

Easton competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference in the PIAA's District XI. Easton has won the District XI 4A championship seven times since the advent of the District XI playoffs in 1985 (1990, 1991, 1993, 2003, 2004, 2009, and 2010) and played in the District XI Finals seventeen times in that time period. Easton has won twenty-four conference championships in its history, winning the Big Five in 1937, 1939, 1943, 1950, 1951, 1958, 1959, 1961 and 1962, the Eastern Big Eight in 1966, 1967, 1968, and 1974, the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference in 1978, 1986, 1987, and 1991, the Mountain Valley Conference in 2001, and the Lehigh Valley Conference in 2003, 2004, 2009, and 2012 and the EPC South in 2014.

Easton has had 48 players selected to the Associated Press All-State team, including Ray Rissmiller (1959 and 1960), an All-SEC tackle at Georgia, who played for the Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, and Buffalo Bills]. Thirty Easton players have been selected to play in the prestigious Big 33 all-star game. In 1993, Easton tailback Juan Gaddy was just the third player in Pennsylvania history to rush for over 5,000 career yards, made a pair of AP All-State teams, and was MVP of the Big 33 game.

Easton is historically known for strong, physical defenses and a power running game.  Easton has allowed less than 10 points per game more for a season 35 times since World War II, including nine years giving up less than a touchdown per game.

Only eight men have coached at Easton since 1912. James Reilly coached from 1912 to 1930 (missing 1918 to serve in World War I) and went 129–21–10, setting program records for wins and winning percentage. After an unsuccessful stint by John Kressler from 1931 to 1934, former NFL running back Bird Carroll took over the program, going 74–31–8 from 1935 to 1946 and winning the 1939 state championship. Carroll was succeeded by Bob Rute, the quarterback on the 1939 team and Easton's first All-State selection. After a successful playing career at Duke and service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Rute coached at Easton from 1948 to 1967, with a career record of 131-56-9, breaking Reilly's wins record. Rute's 1958 team was inducted into the Easton Hall of Fame in 2014 and is generally regarded as the strongest team in school history.

After Rute retired, he was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Wayne Grube, who went 81-44-7 from 1968 to 1979, winning a state title in his first season and finishing #2 in Pennsylvania with a 10-0-1 record in 1978. Bob Shriver coached from 1980 to 1992, with a record of 105-50-2, and led Easton to their first state playoff appearance in 1991, where they lost in the state semifinals. Shriver was succeeded by Steve Shiffert, who had been on Shriver's staff as the offensive line coach. Shiffert holds the all-time wins record at Easton, with a career record of 216-89-1, and has six conference and five District XI championships. His 216 wins are fifth in District XI history and second among active coaches. He led Easton to the state semifinals in 1993, 2003, and 2004 and state quarterfinals in 2009 and 2010. Shiffert also owned a 17–6–1 record against archrival Phillipsburg in Thanksgiving Day games. In January 2017, Shiffert was fired after a 7–6 season. He was replaced by longtime assistant coach Jeff Braido, who will begin his career in the 2017 season.

Easton has played their home games at Cottingham Stadium since 1924. Named for former superintendent William Cottingham, Cottingham Stadium is one of the oldest high school football venues in Pennsylvania and is often recognized as one of the most iconic stadiums in the state. Lights were installed in 1953, and it seats approximately 5,500. Cottingham Stadium sits in Easton's West Ward neighborhood, across the street from the old high school building, which now is Paxinosa Elementary School.

Rivalry with Phillipsburg High School

The high school has a rivalry with Phillipsburg High School in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. The two teams play an annual Thanksgiving Day football game at Lafayette College's Fisher Field, which is considered one of the nation's longest-standing high school rivalries. The rivalry began in 1905 and is still ongoing.

The game, which typically draws over 20,000 fans, has been televised nationally. The 1988 game, which was broadcast on ESPN, was the first high school football game to be broadcast on national television. The 100th-anniversary game played in 2006 and won by Easton 21–7, was broadcast on ESPN2. Easton leads the overall series with 61 wins; Phillipsburg has 42, and the teams have tied five times. One of these ties, the 1993 game, was resolved as part of the Gatorade REPLAY series. The Easton and Phillipsburg teams from 1993 were brought back to play a rematch in early April 2009; Phillipsburg won the game 27–12.

The two schools have participated in an annual rivalry since 1905, in which Easton leads 63-42-5 through the 2017 season. NJ.com listed the rivalry in the second spot on their 2017 list, "Ranking the 31 fiercest rivalries in N.J. HS football", reporting that the only thing that kept it from being top-ranked was that Easton is not in New Jersey.

Wrestling

Easton has one of the strongest wrestling programs in the country, with an all-time dual meet record of 925-223-15. Easton is second overall in Pennsylvania history with 35 state champions, including 1984 Summer Olympics gold medalist Bobby Weaver (1975, 1976, 1977), two-time NCAA champion Jack Cuvo (1983, 1984, 1985) and Jordan Oliver (2006, 2007, 2008), two-time NCAA finalist and University of Nebraska associate head coach Bryan Snyder (1997), NCAA All-Americans Jamarr Billman (1996, 1997) and Mitchell Minotti (2011), and former North Carolina State University football coach Chuck Amato (1965). Easton has produced 185 PIAA District 11 champions, 116 Northeast Regional Champions, 127 PIAA state medalists, 55 PIAA state finalists, and 35 PIAA state champions. At the collegiate level, Easton wrestlers have earned 21 NCAA Division I All-Americans honors, eight NCAA Finals appearances, and four NCAA championships.

The program was started in 1947 by assistant football coach Gust Zarnas, a former All-American offensive lineman at Ohio State and a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. Dick Rutt was Easton's first state champion, winning the 105-pound weight class in 1949. From 1948 to 2015, Easton crowned at least one champion at the District 11 Tournament in every season, setting a Pennsylvania record known as The Streak. Former Easton coaches John Maitland, Dave Crowell, and Steve Powell are all members of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. Powell retired in 2016 after 32 years as the head coach with a career record of 532-126-3, four state championships, and four state duals championships. He coached 19 individual state champions, third most of any coach in Pennsylvania history. His eight combined state titles are the most of any coach in Pennsylvania history. 

Since the PIAA began crowning a team champion at the state tournament in 1976, Easton has won six state championships (1981, 1983, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002) and finished in the top five eighteen times. Pennsylvania added a State Dual tournament in 1999, which Easton won four years in a row from 2001 to 2004. Easton has been to the State Dual Finals eight times, a Pennsylvania record, and their four championships are tied for the most in the state. Since the advent of national rankings by publications such as Amateur Wrestling News and Wrestling USA, Easton has been a consistent presence in the national rankings. In 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2002, Easton was the #1 public school wrestling team in the country. Easton finished in the top five nationally in 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, and 2004 and earned national rankings fourteen times between 1989 and 2011. Additionally, Wrestling USA named Easton the third-best high school program and the best public school program in the nation during the 1990s.

Easton is coached by Jamarr Billman, a two-time state champion for the Red Rovers and a three-time NCAA All-American at Penn State and Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania and the first African-American head coach in any boys sport at Easton. Billman has been an assistant coach at Cornell University, Wilson Area High School, and at Easton.
