He blasted onto the track scene when he was the bronze medalist at the 2002 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships while representing Washington State University .  Henry finished only behind silver medalist Leonard Scott and gold medalist Justin Gatlin who later tested positive for amphetamines.  Talk of moving Henry up to the silver medal position went unconcluded.  He would later be a favorite at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, but due to a muscle cramp in the 100m final Henry hobbled across the line in an unexpected 8th-place finish.  Henry still remains the Washington State University record holder in the 60m (6.65), 100m (10.04w, 10.17) and 200m (20.52).

He won a relay silver medal at the 2007 Pan American Games and also finished 7th in the 100m.

Later on in 2007 Henry would have an impressive 10th-place finish overall in the 100m dash at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan.  This was the best finish by a Canadian sprinter at any major championships in the 100m since Bruny Surin won bronze at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, Spain.

He also competed at the 2008 Olympic Games without reaching the final. In Beijing he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 4th in his heat behind Francis Obikwelu, Obinna Metu and Walter Dix.  He improved his time to 10.33 in the quarter-finals, but failed to qualify to the semi-finals as he finished only in seventh place. Together with Hank Palmer, Pierre Browne and Jared Connaughton he also competed at the 4x100 metres relay. In their qualification heat they placed second behind Jamaica, but in front of Germany and China.
