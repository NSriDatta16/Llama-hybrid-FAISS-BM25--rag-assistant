Gwynedd Mercy University (GMercyU) is a private Roman Catholic university in Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania. It occupies a  campus in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.

Gwynedd Mercy University was founded in 1948, as Gwynedd-Mercy College, by the Sisters of Mercy as a junior college. In 1963 the college was rechartered as a baccalaureate institution. The school later renamed itself Gwynedd Mercy University. GMercyU offers more than 40 undergraduate and graduate degrees in nursing, education, business, and the arts & sciences.

History 
Dating to the early 1900s, the grounds were originally owned by Frances Bond, an investment banker, and were known as Willowbrook Farm. The farm hosted a large Gregorian mansion, formal gardens and outbuildings that were designed by Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, the architect of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The mansion is over one hundred years old and was the home of the Bonds; it is still in use by the university today as Assumption Hall.

For a time Frances' son and respected ornithologist James Bond lived on the land. When birdwatcher and author Ian Fleming needed a name for his famous protagonist he turned to a notable bird-watching guide written by Bond. "I was looking for a name for my hero – nothing like Peregrine Carruthers or 'Standfast' Maltravers - and I found it on the cover of Birds of the West Indies by James Bond," wrote Fleming in the book Ian Fleming Introduces Jamaica.

Frances Bond's wife Margaret died in 1910, a few years after the Gregorian Mansion was finished in 1906–1907. Two years after her death, Bond sold Willowbrook Farm to Roland and Anita Taylor. The couple renamed the farm Treweryn, after the creek that flows through the property. Mr. Taylor was an enthusiastic landscaper who planted many ornamental trees and shrubs, including 53 varieties of Rhododendron. After the death of the Taylors, their daughters sold the mansion, outbuildings and additional land to the Sisters of Mercy in 1948.
