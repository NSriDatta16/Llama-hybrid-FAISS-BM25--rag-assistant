Indiana is the third album by singer-songwriter David Mead, released in 2004 on Nettwerk America. "While the material here can have the feel of adult contemporary singer/songwriter fare, the depth of Mead's writing, both lyrically and melodically, steers it clear of any of the banalities that can creep into the genre," wrote Brett Hartenbach in a review for AllMusic. "Indiana may lack the immediate hookiness that made The Luxury of Time and Mine and Yours so irresistible, but it's every bit as strong and should prove to be just as enduring." PopMatters's review of the album declared, "David Mead proves he’s only getting better — and while those looking to be rocked might be put off by this relatively mid-tempo collection, there’s no denying the quality of each of these special songs. His voice covers a wide range to falsetto and back again; his songs exude emotion, honesty and wit."
