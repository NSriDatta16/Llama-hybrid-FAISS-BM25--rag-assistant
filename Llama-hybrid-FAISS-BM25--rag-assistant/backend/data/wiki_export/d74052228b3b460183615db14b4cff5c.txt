Ferenc Krausz (born 17 May 1962) is a Hungarian–Austrian physicist working in attosecond science. He is a director at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and a professor of experimental physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. His research team has generated and measured the first attosecond light pulse and used it for capturing electrons' motion inside atoms, marking the birth of attophysics. In 2023, jointly with Pierre Agostini and Anne L'Huillier, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics.

Academic career 
From 1981 until 1985 Krausz studied theoretical physics at Eötvös Loránd University and electrical engineering at the Technical University of Budapest in Hungary. He began his research work at BME Institute of Physics, and spent three years researching in the university's laser laboratory. From 1987 to 1991 he graduated with a PhD at the Technical University of Vienna, in Austria, and from 1991 to 1993 he did his habilitation also there. 1996–1998 he became associate professor, from 1999 until 2004 professor of electrical engineering at the same institute. In 2003 he was appointed director at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching and in 2004 became chair of experimental physics at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich. In 2006 he co-founded the Munich-Centre for Advanced Photonics (MAP) and became one of its directors.
