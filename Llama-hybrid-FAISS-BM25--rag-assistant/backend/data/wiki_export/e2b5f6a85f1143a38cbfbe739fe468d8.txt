Andkjelvatnet is a lake that lies in the municipality of Sørfold in Nordland county, Norway.  It is located in the southeastern part of the municipality of Sørfold, about  northeast of the village of Straumen.  The water flows out through the Tørrfjordelva river into the Sørfolda fjord.  Most of the water that would naturally flow into the lake from the lake Sisovatnet to the east is diverted to a hydroelectric power station on the lake Straumvatnet.
