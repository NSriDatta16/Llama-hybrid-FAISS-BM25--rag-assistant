FictionJunction is the solo project of Japanese composer Yuki Kajiura featuring guests musicians, mainly singers. Historically, works between Kajiura and a vocalist were referenced by adding the singer's name after "FictionJunction". Although both perform under the FJ title and are collaborations with Kajiura, they are separate projects.

Background
Yuki Kajiura had been working on various soundtracks, including one for Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In 2003, she released the solo album, Fiction. In 2004, she hired vocalist Yuuka Nanri to sing on some of her tracks, including "" which became a hit. In 2005, she added vocalists Kaori Oda, Keiko Kubota, and Wakana Ootaki, who each have their own project.

Kajiura does not consider the group to have "members". At Anime Expo 2012, she said: "To be honest, FictionJunction is not a 'group.' FictionJunction is just me. Well, actually, it depends on the music and the song. We have gathered several members and singers from everywhere. We don't have 'member' members. I *am* FictionJunction. But I am 'collecting' all the singers that are powerful and worthy to be in this group. They are true professionals, each individual here. I respect them, and I do look up to them. They have the most beautiful voices, and that's how they're selected."

Personnel
With the exception of Yuriko Kaida and Joelle, each vocalist has had her own FictionJunction pre-title. Each vocalist's work is considered an individual project.  Some of Yuki Kajiura's vocalists now go by a capitalized names (e.g. Kaori Oda went by FictionJunction Kaori, but now goes by KAORI). At Anime Expo 2012, Kajiura brought vocalists Kaori, Keiko, Wakana and Yuriko Kaida to represent FictionJunction.
