The Delaware Handicap is an American Thoroughbred horse race run annually in mid July at Delaware Park Racetrack in  Wilmington, Delaware. The Grade 2 race is open to fillies and mares, age three and up, willing to race one mile and three-sixteenths on the dirt.

The race was inaugurated as the New Castle Handicap as part of the racing schedule with the 1937 opening of Delaware Park Racetrack. In 1953, the  new $100,000 purse offered by the New Castle Handicap made it the richest race in the world for fillies and mares. In 1955 it was renamed the Delaware Handicap.

The race was held at Saratoga from 1982 until 1985.

In 2017, champion filly Songbird won as the shortest-priced favorite in the race's history at 1-9 odds.

In 2023, Delaware Park management announced that the race would be shortened to  miles, citing difficulties in attracting top fillies and mares to run the -mile distance.

In 1939, Shangay Lily won the race as a seven year old, and is the oldest winner of the race.
