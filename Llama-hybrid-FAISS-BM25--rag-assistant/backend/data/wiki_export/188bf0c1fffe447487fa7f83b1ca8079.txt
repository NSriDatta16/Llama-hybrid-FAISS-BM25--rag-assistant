The Cabinet of the United States, which is the principal advisory body to the president of the United States, has had numerous permanent members serve as heads of multiple different federal executive departments, along with the vice president or other cabinet-level positions, which can differ under each president. As the years progressed, some departments lost their original status in the president's cabinet, while other offices were established or reorganized as such. Unlike in many parliamentary cabinets, it is generally less common in the United States for officeholders to obtain multiple positions over the years.

Edmund Randolph became the first person to have served in two different presidential cabinet posts when he was appointed secretary of state by President George Washington in 1794
after previously serving as attorney general during Washington's first term in office. Patricia Roberts Harris was the first woman and the first person of color to serve multiple posts in a president's cabinet when President Jimmy Carter appointed her secretary of health and human services in 1979, having earlier served as secretary of housing and urban development through the first half of Carter's administration.

Elliot Richardson held the most different positions within the presidential cabinet with four, having served as secretary of health, education, and welfare; secretary of defense; and attorney general, all three under President Richard Nixon, as well as secretary of commerce for Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford. That record was equaled by George Shultz, who served successively within the Nixon administration—first as secretary of labor, then in a cabinet-rank position as director of the Office of Management and Budget, and finally as secretary of the treasury—before being appointed secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan.
