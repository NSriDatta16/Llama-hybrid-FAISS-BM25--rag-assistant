History
The Diabetic Association for Pakistan (later Bangladesh Diabetic Association) was formed under the leadership of national professor Muhammad Ibrahim in February 1956. He offered a ground floor room of his home in Segunbagicha, Dhaka, to be used by the association, and there he began outpatient services for diabetes. While Bangladesh was still part of Pakistan, the government granted the association land in Segunbagicha for a hospital. BIRDEM hospital was inaugurated in 1980 at Shahbagh. In 2013, BIRDEM-2 hospital was started in Segunbagicha.
