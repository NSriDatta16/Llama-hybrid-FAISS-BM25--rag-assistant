The school is situated on a  campus that borders the DCR's Blue Hills Reservation, and is within view of Great Blue Hill. The schools mascot is the Warriors

The Blue Hills Regional School District was formed on December 17, 1963, to serve the needs of the member towns' residents. The District School Committee was then authorized by the towns to establish and maintain educational programs at the secondary, post-secondary and adult levels in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 74 of the General Laws of Massachusetts, which require all municipalities in Massachusetts to offer vocational education for high school students that request it.

The original school building was opened to the first class in September 1966. Its success, coupled with increasing admissions, necessitated the building of additional facilities. Moreover, local employers were expressing a need for employees trained in certain skills areas. By 1976, the school had been expanded to house approximately 1,230 students in the high school, while also serving another 1,400 students in the adult education programs.
