The McGuire-Cummings Manufacturing Company was a streetcar and street-railway equipment builder based in the U.S. state of Illinois.  It was originally based in Chicago, but had a subsidiary factory in Paris, Illinois, and in its last years it was based in the latter city. It was founded in 1888 as the McGuire Manufacturing Company, later becoming McGuire-Cummings, and finally the Cummings Car and Coach Company. Snowplow cars and snow sweepersstreet railway cars designed specifically for snow removalwere among its most popular and best-known products.  The company built its last streetcars in 1930, but remained in business until 1943.  McGuire-Cummings was one of a few suppliers for the Toronto Civic Railways.

History

Overview
In The Time of the Trolley, historian William D. Middleton wrote that the company "was initially active as a builder of [street]car trucks, later produced [street railway] snowplows and sweepers, and finally manufactured a general line of steam and electric railway equipment."

Although North America was its principal market, the company also sold its products in foreign markets. Its snow sweeper, in particular, "was a popular item on dozens of European tramway systems," Middleton wrote.

In 1904, McGuire Manufacturing was renamed the McGuire-Cummings Manufacturing Company, with Walter J. Cummings as president.  In 1925, it became the Cummings Car & Coach Company, and was based in Paris, Illinois.  The company's streetcar production ended in 1930.

It was closing up the largest snowplow business the company has ever done in one year, with two orders, 10 for Washington, D.C., and 15 for St. Louis, besides a large number of single orders, among them being one for Spokane, Washington, and one for Burlington, Vermont. 

Plans were being prepared in 1899 for an additional building to be added to the McGuire plant that winter. It was planned to cover the piece of ground on the corner of Kinzie and Morgan Sts., being . on Morgan by . on Kinzie. This building was planned to be five stories high and devoted entirely to sweeper, electric locomotive, and sprinkler woodwork.
