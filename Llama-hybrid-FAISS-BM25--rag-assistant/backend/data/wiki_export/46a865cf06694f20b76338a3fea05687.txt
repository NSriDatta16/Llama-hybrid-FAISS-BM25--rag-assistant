The Suite en 3 mouvements in C major, FP 19, is a suite for piano by Francis Poulenc which contains three movements:

I    Presto
II   Andante
III  Vif

The suite was completed in March 1920 and was first performed on April 10 of the same year by pianist Ricardo Vi√±es in the Paris Conservatory. Along with the waltz he contributed to L'Album des Six, a project completed by members of Les Six, this suite marked a return to the anti-impressionist style for which Poulenc was known; a style which is more clear and airy and in the spirit of French Harpsichordists as well as the more traditional style of Scarlatti.
