Early years

Early Marine Corps career
Henderson departed the United States on November 3, 1927 from San Francisco, California and arrived at Chingwangtao, China on December 16, 1927.  He was assigned as a platoon commander with the 15th Machine Gun and Howitzer Company, 12th Regiment, 3rd Brigade at Tientsin.  After passing a flight physical while in China, he received orders to report to Observation Squadron 8 (VO-8M) in San Diego, California.  He departed China on July 28, 1928 onboard the USS Chaumont (AP-5) arriving in San Francisco on August 17, 1928.

World War II
On June 4, 1942, as Japanese forces approached Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean, Major Henderson, the commanding officer of VMSB-241, led 16 Marine Corps aircraft in the attack. Henderson split his squadron into two flights, one with SBD Dauntless and one with SB2U Vindicator dive bombers in a glide bombing attack on the aircraft carrier Hiryū. His left wing burst into flames as he began his final approach. Henderson continued the attack and perished as his plane dived toward the enemy carrier. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

The Navy Cross is presented to Lofton R.

With utter disregard for his own personal safety, Major Henderson, with keen judgment and courageous aggressiveness in the face of strong enemy fighter opposition, led his squadron in an attack which contributed materially to the defeat of the enemy. He was subsequently reported as missing in action. It is believed he gallantly gave up his life in the service of his country.

Legacy
In August 1942, the partially constructed Japanese airfield on Guadalcanal was captured at the outset of a six-month campaign to expel the enemy from both Guadalcanal and nearby and smaller Tulagi. It was named Henderson Field (now Honiara International Airport) in his honor.

Another Henderson Field (IATA: MDY, ICAO: PMDY) is today a public airport on Sand Island in Midway Atoll, an unincorporated territory of the United States. The airport is used as an emergency diversion point for ETOPS operations.  The airfield provides access to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. It operated until 1993 as Naval Air Facility Midway.  The original Henderson Field was on Eastern Island (Midway Atoll).

In 1945, the   was named after him.

The 21st Street Bridge in his hometown of Lorain, Ohio, was renamed the Lofton Henderson Memorial Bridge.
