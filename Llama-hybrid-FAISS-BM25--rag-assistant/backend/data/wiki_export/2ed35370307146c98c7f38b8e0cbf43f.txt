The Guides du Bénin (Girl Guides of Benin) is the national Guiding organization of Benin. Guiding in Benin started in 1954, the association was founded in 1960 and became a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) in 1963.  The girls-only association has 1,533 members (as of 2003). It is affiliated to Scoutisme Béninois, the national member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.

History 
The first Guide patrols in then-Dahomey developed in Porto-Novo in 1954.  Two years later, the first Guide camp was held and the movement spread to Cotonou.  When the association was official founded in 1960, all three sections were introduced.  In 1963, the Guides du Bénin became an associate member of WAGGGS. In the following years, membership numbers stagnated, and the association was only granted full membership in WAGGGS in 2005.
