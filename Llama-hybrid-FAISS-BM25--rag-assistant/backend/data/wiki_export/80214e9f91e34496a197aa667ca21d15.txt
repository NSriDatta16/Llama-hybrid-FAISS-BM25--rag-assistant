Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight is a posthumous live album by Jimi Hendrix released on November 12, 2002.  The album documents Hendrix's last U.K. live performance at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 31, 1970, three weeks before his death. The set list for the concert contained songs from the original Experience albums, as well as new songs. Some were previously available on Isle of Wight (1971) and Live Isle of Wight '70 (1991). "Power to Love (Message of Love)", "Midnight Lightning", and "Foxy Lady" released in the US on the three record set The First Great Rock Festivals of the 70s: Isle of Wight/Atlanta Pop Festival" released on Columbia Records in 1971.

Overview
Included in the set was an adaptation of "God Save the Queen" and a cover of The Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", played just before launching into "Spanish Castle Magic". The 22-minute version of "Machine Gun" includes walkie-talkie interference from security personnel feeding through the sound equipment.

The CD set is more complete than the DVD release as it contains "Midnight Lightning", "Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)", and "Hey Joe", three songs omitted from the DVD. There was also a "highlights" album released as a single disc, which contained eleven songs – nine from disc one and two from disc two.  It was re-released in 2003 as a three-disc "Deluxe Sound & Vision Edition" in a special box and slip cover format as part of Experience Hendrix's plan to re-release most of Jimi Hendrix's recorded material.
