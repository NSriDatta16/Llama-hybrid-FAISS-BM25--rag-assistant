Alexander Alexandrovich Kornilov (; 30 November 1862 – 26 April 1925) was a Russian historian and liberal politician.

Biography

Prior to the Russian Revolution of 1917, Kornilov was a history professor at the Polytechnicum of Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg and author of a definitive history of 19th century Russia. He specialized in the reign of Alexander II of Russia and the life of Mikhail Bakunin. In 1917, he served as secretary of the Central Committee of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party and chairman of the party's Petrograd Committee.

After the Russian Civil War (1918–1920) Kornilov taught at the renamed Polytechnical Institute in Petrograd and continued his work on Bakunin.
