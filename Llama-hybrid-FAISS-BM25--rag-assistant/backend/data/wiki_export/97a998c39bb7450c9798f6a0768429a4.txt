Objetivo Fama (sometimes abbreviated as OF, Spanish for Target: Fame) is a Puerto Rican singing talent contest that aired for over six years on WLII, the Univision outlet in Puerto Rico; and on Telefutura in the mainland United States. It is produced by Ender Vega and Soraya Sánchez ES Television.

The program was loosely inspired by the late Puerto Rican singing talent contest and variety show, Voces en Función, and the Spanish reality show, Operación Triunfo. Twenty or so contestants are "bunkered" in a studio/house where they will live together for several months while participating in a weekly show where one of them is eliminated, en route to find a "young star". The winner of the show gets a record deal from Univision Music Group. The show aired for six years, starting in 2004, and finishing in 2009.

Contestants were evaluated by a panel of judges, and viewers had the opportunity to vote on who they wanted to stay or leave the competition. Also, during the week they were assisted by singing and dancing teachers, stylists, costume designers, personal trainers, etc. in the studio/house to help them shape and improve their talent and image. The show was often said to be the Spanish version of American Idol, although technically speaking, the official Spanish version of that show is Latin American Idol.

History
The show ran for six season, from 2004 to 2009.
