The Football Queensland Premier League 3 - Metro is the first tier of senior soccer in Brisbane, Queensland (fourth tier in Queensland and fifth overall in Australia). It is run and administered by Football Queensland Metro. Formerly known as the Brisbane Premier League the competition was renamed in 2022 with Football Queensland's takeover of the league structure from Football Brisbane. Twelve teams play a twenty-two match regular season, with the team at the top of the table designated as 'Premiers', and the top four teams qualifying for a finals series.

The league premiers earn automatic promotion to the Queensland Premier League 2 (the third-tier league in Queensland from season 2020 onwards), while the second place team participates in a playoff series with the other south east Queensland conference premiers for the second promotion spot. The bottom two teams in the FQPL3 at the end of the season are relegated to the next tier in Brisbane, FQPL4.

Media

The league and its lower divisions are covered by several local newspapers throughout the city, suburbs and surrounding areas including Ipswich and Toowoomba. Highlights of matches, often at least 2 matches per round, in the league are put together by FB Media (the Media arm of Football Brisbane). Live scores and updates from all Brisbane Premier League matches can be found on The Washing Line Facebook page. The Washing Line website also publishes reports, previews and newspaper articles from around the city. The website built upon the Unofficial site YourBPL.com which began media coverage of the league in 2007. From 2012, the newly founded 'FB Media' has been producing weekly podcasts which can be downloaded from The Washing Line website featuring prominent guests including James Meyer, Miron Bleiberg, Matt Mundy and a wide variety of coaches and players from the Brisbane Premier League.
Some games are covered by PaulyTV and FBTV.
