Halestorm Entertainment was a film production and distribution company based in Orem, Utah. It was founded in January 2001 by Kurt Hale and Dave Hunter, who were both film majors at Brigham Young University.  Halestorm films were largely created by, for, and about Latter-day Saints, and usually contain a 
high number of clich√©s and stereotypes about the behavior and culture of mainland Western United States members of the Church. Because of that, their films are mostly shown in first run movie theatres in that region, where most US members of that church live.

The company started with a successful first film, The Singles Ward, released in 2002. However, with a major box office failure in The Home Teachers it faced a declining market for explicitly Mormon-themed comedy films. In response, Halestorm phased out of producing explicitly LDS-based films with Church Ball sporting fewer in-jokes and named talent in an attempt to gain a wider audience.

The company was quietly dissolved in 2020 after years of inactivity. Currently, Deseret Book controls most of their library.
