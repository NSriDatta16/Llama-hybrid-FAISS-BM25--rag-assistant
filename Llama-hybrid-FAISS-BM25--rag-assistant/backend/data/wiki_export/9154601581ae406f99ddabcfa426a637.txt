God Says No is the fifth studio album by American rock band Monster Magnet. It was released in the United Kingdom on November 12, 2000, and in the United States on April 10, 2001. It was a commercial failure compared to their previous album, Powertrip. It was their last release recorded for A&M Records, due to problems with promotion of the album but it reached #17 in Germany.  It would also be the last release with bassist Joe Calandra and drummer Jon Kleiman.

The track "Medicine", which appears on the US release, is a re-recording of a track which originally appeared on the band's 1991 album Spine of God. A music video was made for the 1991 version.

Two different music videos were produced for the song "Heads Explode" and one for "Melt", consisting mostly of live footage over the studio version of the track.
