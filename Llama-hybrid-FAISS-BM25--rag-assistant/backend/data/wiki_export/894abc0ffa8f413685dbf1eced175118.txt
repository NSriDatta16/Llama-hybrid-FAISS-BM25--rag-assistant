The Gardens Mall is a two-story, enclosed shopping mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. The mall features Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, and Sears.

History
The Gardens Mall, originally called The Gardens of The Palm Beaches, was developed by The Forbes Company, based in Southfield, Michigan. On October 5, 1988, the mall opened with three initial anchor stores: Burdines, Sears and the second Macy's in Florida. Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue joined as tenants in 1990. Burdines was shuttered in 2003 as Federated Department Stores (now Macy's, Inc.), the owners of the Macy's chain, consolidated all its nameplates into the Macy's brand, which already had a location at the mall. In March 2006, Nordstrom opened on the former Burdines site instead.

In 2005, the Florida Department of Transportation completed a new interchange at PGA Boulevard (SR 786) and SR 811, providing direct access from the mall entrance to I-95.

In October 2007, the mall underwent minor renovations. The fountain in the center was altered and the center court's garden theme was replaced with a more modern look. In April 2019, Macy's opened Macy's Backstage.
