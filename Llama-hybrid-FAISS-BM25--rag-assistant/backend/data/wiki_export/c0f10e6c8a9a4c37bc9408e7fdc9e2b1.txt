Charles Howland Hammatt Billings (1818–1874) was an artist and architect from Boston, Massachusetts.

Among his works are the original illustrations for Uncle Tom's Cabin (both the initial printing

and an expanded 1853 edition),

the National Monument to the Forefathers, the Civil War monument in Concord, Mass.,  and the 19th-century granite canopy (since replaced) for the Plymouth Rock memorial. He worked for some years with his brother Joseph Edward Billings, also an architect.

He was the artist of one of the well-noted portrayals of the Battle of Lexington.
