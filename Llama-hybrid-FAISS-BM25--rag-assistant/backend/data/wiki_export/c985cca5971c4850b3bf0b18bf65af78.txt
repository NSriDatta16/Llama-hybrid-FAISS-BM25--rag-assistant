Tribute to Uncle Ray is the second studio album by Little Stevie Wonder, released by Motown in October 1962, shortly after The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie. Even though it was released second, it had been recorded first, when Wonder was just 11 years old.  The album was an attempt by Berry Gordy and Motown to associate the young "Little Stevie Wonder" with the successful and popular Ray Charles who was also a blind African American musician. Like his debut, this album failed to generate hit singles as Motown struggled to find a sound to fit Wonder, who was just 12 when this album was released.
