Inclusion in Rock Band
In 2007, this song was included in the Harmonix music video game Rock Band, exposing Coheed and Cambria to a considerably wider audience. However, the words "whore" and "fucking" were edited to "wolf" and "mucking" respectively. The conclusion of the song was also edited, replacing the fade-out and the strings with a short guitar solo as the player earns the ending bonus points.

Ghetts' "Menace" 
British grime and rap MC Ghetts' track "Menace" samples the "Welcome Home" riff. "Menace" appeared as track 5 on his 2007 debut studio album, "Ghetto Gospel," when the artist was still known as Ghetto. "Menace" was produced by fellow The Movement MC and producer, Scorcher. The song "was widely accepted in the UK by Grime fans and seen as one of [Ghetts'] classics."
