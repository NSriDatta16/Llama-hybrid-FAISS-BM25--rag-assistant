History
The first concession for XESDD was issued for 920 kHz at Ensenada, Baja California in 1988. XESDD was originally owned by Juan José de Jesús Espejo Munguía and broadcast with 2,500 watts during the day and 200 at night.

In 1999, XESDD was bought by Radio S.A., which sold its Baja California stations to Media Sports de México, S.A. de C.V. Under Media Sports, XESDD initially became an ESPN Deportes affiliate, then swapped programming with XESS to become La Tremenda. It also moved from 920 kHz to 1030 kHz in order to resolve interference issues to 910 and 930 kHz.
