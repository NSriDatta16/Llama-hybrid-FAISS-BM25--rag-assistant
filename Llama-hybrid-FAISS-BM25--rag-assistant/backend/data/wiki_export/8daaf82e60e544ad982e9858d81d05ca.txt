Abie's Irish Rose is a 1928 early talking (part-talkie) film directed by Victor Fleming and starring Charles "Buddy" Rogers, Nancy Carroll, Jean Hersholt, and J. Farrell MacDonald. It is based on the 1922 play Abie's Irish Rose by Anne Nichols. The film was later remade in 1946.

Plot
A Jewish boy, Abie Levy (Rogers), falls in love with and secretly marries Rosemary Murphy (Carroll), an Irish Catholic girl, but lies to his family, saying that she's Jewish. The fathers of both bride and groom are at first religiously bigoted toward the other but with the birth of twin grandchildren, their antagonism fades.
