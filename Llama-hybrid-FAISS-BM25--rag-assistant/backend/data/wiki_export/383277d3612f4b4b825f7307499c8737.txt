History
The likely meaning of the name Christleton is "Christians' farm or settlement", derived from the Old English cristen (a Christian) - tūn (a settlement, enclosure or farmstead).

Its history can be traced with certainty to the Domesday Book, which contains an entry for Christetone, though there is evidence of earlier occupation. 
By 1086, the land was under the ownership of Robert FitzHugh (son of Hugh Lupus) and comprised 23 households: twelve villagers, five smallholders, two female slaves (maidservants), two "reeves" (officials) and two "radmen" (riders or roadmen).

During the English Civil War it was a Royalist outpost.

Governance
Christleton is part of the City of Chester parliamentary constituency.

The unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester replaced Chester City Council and Cheshire County Council on 1 April 2009. The village is within the electoral ward of Christleton and Huntington.

Christleton is represented locally by its own parish council.
