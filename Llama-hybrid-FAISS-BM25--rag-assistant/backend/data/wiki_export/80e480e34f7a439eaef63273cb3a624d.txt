Dypvåg is a former municipality in the old Aust-Agder county, Norway.  The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1960 when it was merged into the present-day municipality of Tvedestrand which is in Agder county. The small municipality included the coastal area about  east of the town of Tvedestrand and several islands located just offshore.  The administrative centre was the village of Dypvåg where the Dypvåg Church is located.

History
The parish of Dybvaag (later spelled "Dypvåg") was established as a civil municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law).  On 1 January 1881, a part of the municipality of Holt (population: 52) was transferred to Dypvåg. Then later, on 1 January 1887, an uninhabited part of neighboring Søndeled municipality was transferred to Dypvåg. On 1 January 1902, the western half of Dypvåg (population: 1,892) was separated from the rest of Dypvåg (population: 3,235) to form the new municipality of Flosta.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1960, the municipality of Dypvåg (population: 1,805) was merged with the neighboring municipality of Holt and the town of Tvedestrand to form a new, enlarged municipality of Tvedestrand which had a population of 6,432.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Dybvaag farm ( or ) since the first Dypvåg Church was built there. The first element comes from the word  which means "deep". The last element is  which means "inlet" or "bay". Historically, the name was spelled Dybvaag, using a Danish spelling. Prior to the 1917 Norwegian language reform law, the name was spelled with the digraph "aa", and after this reform, the letter å was used instead. Also at this time, the b was changed to a p to give it a more Norwegian spelling.

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
