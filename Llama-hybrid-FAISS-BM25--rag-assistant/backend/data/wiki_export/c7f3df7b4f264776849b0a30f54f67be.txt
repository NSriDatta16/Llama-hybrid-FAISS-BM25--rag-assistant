Sing Out! was a quarterly journal of folk music and folk songs that was published from May 1950 through spring 2014. It was originally based in New York City, with a national circulation of approximately 10,000 by 1960.

Background
Sing Out! was the primary publication of the tax exempt, not-for-profit, educational corporation of the same name. According to the organization's website, "Sing Out!'''s mission is to preserve and support the cultural diversity and heritage of all traditional and contemporary folk musics, and to encourage making folk music a part of our everyday lives." Irwin Silber was an important co-founder along with Pete Seeger, and was the magazine's long-time editor from 1951 to 1967. Its final editor and executive director, since 1983, was Mark D. Moss. The editors applied a very broad definition of folk music including material from contemporary singer-songwriters, Americana, roots, blues, bluegrass, and world music.

One defining feature of the magazine was the inclusion of 15 or more songs with lyrics and music within the pages of each issuesupplemented with an illustrative CD from 2001 until it ceased publication in 2014. The magazine also contained in-depth articles profiling musicians and musical traditions, "teach-ins," reviews of recordings and print publications, a comprehensive festival and camp listing, and columns covering topics such as songwriting, storytelling, children's music, and the folk process.

The corporate headquarters of Sing Out! were located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania which is also home to the Sing Out! Resource Center. The magazine was distributed by mail subscriptions, and could be found in some North American bookstores and libraries.
