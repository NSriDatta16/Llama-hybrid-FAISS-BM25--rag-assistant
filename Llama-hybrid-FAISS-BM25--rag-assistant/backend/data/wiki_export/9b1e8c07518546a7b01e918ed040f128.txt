History
The Rosemont station of the Philadelphia and Western Railroad opened in 1907. On July 19 of that same year, railroad foreman John McNally was struck and killed by a train while he was crossing the tracks.

During the 1920s, proximity to the Rosemont station was a selling point for area realtors. On January 22, 1926, several people were injured when an electric train operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad struck the rear of a westbound express train at the Rosemont station.

The station was renamed from Rosemont to Roberts Road by SEPTA on September 5, 2010.
