Critical reception

The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that "the bluegrass flavor comes through in the understated songwriting, and the vocals are attractive, if rather pallid." USA Today noted that "these four world-class musicians remain technically dazzling even though they've turned to more catchy material with lots of hooks."
