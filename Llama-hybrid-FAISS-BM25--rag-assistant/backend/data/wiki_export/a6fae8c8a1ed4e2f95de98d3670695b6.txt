Duff released her debut studio album Santa Claus Lane through Buena Vista Records in October 2002. The holiday album peaked at the 154th position on the Billboard 200 in the United States, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In 2003, her second studio album Metamorphosis was released by Buena Vista and Hollywood Records. The album, referred to as Duff's "first proper studio album", topped the American and Canadian charts and sold five million copies worldwide. It spawned the hit singles "So Yesterday" and "Come Clean". The album was the breakthrough release for Hollywood Records, becoming the first album in the label's history to earn that much success.

Duff's third studio album, the self-titled Hilary Duff, was released in 2004 and peaked at the second position on the Billboard 200 while topping the Canadian Albums Chart. The album spawned the worldwide single "Fly" and was also promoted with an Australian-only single; "Someone's Watching Over Me". In 2005, she released her first compilation album, Most Wanted, which became her first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. The album spawned the singles "Wake Up" and "Beat of My Heart", which both peaked in the top ten in Italy. The following year, Duff released 4ever Hilary Duff, an Italy-exclusive compilation.

Duff's fourth studio album, Dignity, was released in 2007 and reached the top ten in the US, Canada, and Italy. The lead single "Play with Fire" failed to make an impact on national charts, though it did begin a string of American club hits for Duff, peaking at the 31st position on Billboard'''s Hot Dance Club Songs chart. The second single "With Love" became her highest-peaking single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 24, while also reaching number one on the club charts along with the album's final single "Stranger". She scored her third consecutive number-one club hit with "Reach Out", the lead single from her first greatest hits release Best of Hilary Duff (2008). The album peaked at number 125 on the Billboard 200.
