"The Subway" is the 30th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. It is the 13th episode of the show's third season. It aired on January 8, 1992.

The episode was written by Larry Charles and was directed by Tom Cherones.

Plot
The four principal characters ride the subway together, encountering a busking violinist who appears to be pretending to be blind. When they split and ride separately to reach their various destinations, each of the four has a unique experience: 

Jerry at first mocks, then befriends an overweight nudist (Ernie Sabella) on his ride to Coney Island to pick up his found car (The Alternate Side). Jerry and the Nudist end up spending so much time riding The Cyclone and eating at Nathan's Famous that by the time Jerry gets to the garage where his car is, it's closed for the day.

George meets an enchanting woman passenger (Barbara Stock) who asks about his job. Rather than tell her he is unemployed and looking for work, he lies and tells the woman he works in the stock market. After seducing George, she takes him to her hotel bedroom, handcuffs him to a bed while he is in his underwear, and robs him - leaving in outrage after finding that George is only carrying $8. George misses his job interview due to the delay and has to walk all the way across the city in a bed sheet to get his spare key from Jerry. 

Kramer overhears a horse racing tip from another passenger, places a $600, 30-to-1 bet at an off-track betting parlor, and wins $18,000 in cash, helping to pay for his numerous traffic violations (including "no doors"). On the subway ride back, Kramer is attacked by another bettor for the money, only to be saved by the blind violinist, revealed as an undercover cop. Kramer ends up paying for his, Jerry and Elaine's dinner at Monk's.

Elaine misses a lesbian wedding she was to attend due to train delays, which make her feel claustrophobic and incredibly frustrated. Another passenger makes conversation until she is scandalized when Elaine reveals she is going to a same-sex wedding.

Reception
In 2012, Paste Magazine named "The Subway" the 16th best episode of the series, citing it as a "great example of how Seinfeld can turn something as everyday and mundane as riding the subway into not one, but four hilarious stories. In 2013, NYC & Company, New York City's official tourism organization, named it the "New Yorkiest" episode of the series.
