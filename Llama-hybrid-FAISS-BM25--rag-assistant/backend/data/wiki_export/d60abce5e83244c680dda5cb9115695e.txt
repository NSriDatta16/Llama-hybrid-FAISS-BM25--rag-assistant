The Juno Awards of 1972, representing Canadian music industry achievements of the previous year, were awarded on 28 February 1972 in Toronto at a ceremony at the Inn on the Park hotel's Centennial Ballroom.

Interest in these music awards was gaining rapidly as approximately 1000 attended the ceremonies, compared to 250 in 1970. George Wilson of CFRB radio was again the master of ceremonies for the awards.

Roughly 3000 subscribers of RPM Magazine completed a survey which determined the winners of this year's awards. Most awards are determined by the poll, except for the songwriting category which was chosen by RPM editor Walt Grealis.
