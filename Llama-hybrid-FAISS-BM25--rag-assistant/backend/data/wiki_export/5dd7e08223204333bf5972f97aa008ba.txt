The University of Nottingham Gliding Club (UoN Gliding) is the gliding club of the University of Nottingham. The aim of the club is to provide affordable flying in order to introduce as many members as possible to unpowered flight. Affiliated with the Cranwell Gliding Club (CGC), the club is open to any full or associate member of the University of Nottingham Students' Union.

Current status 

The club is one of some 28 University Gliding clubs within the UK, and with over 130 members for the 2016-2017 academic year is also one of the largest. Flying takes place all year-round on weekends and bank holidays at RAF Cranwell, though several expeditions to other gliding sites are organised throughout the year.

History 

The club was formed in the 1970s, and was officially affiliated to the Buckminster Gliding Club at Saltby Airfield. The founding member was Mr Brian Spreckley, then an undergraduate at the University, and subsequently the 1987 World Gliding Champion. In 1987 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club. Then, in 2005 he was also the recipient of the FAI Paul Tissandier Diploma for services to gliding.

In 1990 the club moved from Saltby to begin a new affiliation with the Four Counties Gliding Club, flying from RAF Syerston until 2004, and subsequently at RAF Barkston Heath. The affiliation with Four Counties ended when that club moved to RAF Wittering.

Since May 2005 UoN Gliding have been affiliated to and fly with Cranwell Gliding Club at RAF Cranwell.

It is designed for training, high performance, and aerobatic flying.
