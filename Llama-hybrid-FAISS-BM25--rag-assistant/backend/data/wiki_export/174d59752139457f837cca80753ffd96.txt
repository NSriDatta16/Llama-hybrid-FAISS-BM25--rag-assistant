The Mining and Pastoral Region is a multi-member electoral region of the Western Australian Legislative Council, located in the northern and eastern regions of the state. It was created by the Acts Amendment (Electoral Reform) Act 1987, and became effective on 22 May 1989 with five members who had been elected at the 1989 state election three months earlier. At the 2008 election, it was increased to six members.

Legislation to abolish the region, along with all other Western Australian Electoral Regions was passed in November 2021, with the 2025 state election to use a single state-wide electorate of 37 members.

Geography
The Region is made up of several complete Legislative Assembly districts, which change at each distribution.
