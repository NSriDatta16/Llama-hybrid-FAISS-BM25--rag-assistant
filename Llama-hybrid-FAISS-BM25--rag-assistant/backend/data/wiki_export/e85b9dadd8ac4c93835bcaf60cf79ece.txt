Biography

Bay City Rollers 

He formed the Bay City Rollers in 1964, with his brother Alan (1948-2018). After signing to a record company in 1971, the Rollers would become one of the biggest acts of the 1970s. He appeared on each of the band's nine studio albums through to 1981. He retired from the music industry in the early 1980s and trained as a nurse working at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

Arrest 
In 2000, Longmuir was sentenced to 300 hours of community service after admitting to possessing child pornography. Despite his guilty plea, he maintained that the offending materials did not belong to him but were left behind by an acquaintance. Longmuir said he pleaded guilty in hope of avoiding a "media circus". Despite his conviction and initially being suspended from working as a nurse, the conduct committee of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting (UKCC) decided to give him a caution and allowed him to continue working as a nurse.

In an interview in the Sunday Herald on 7 May 2000, Longmuir's foster son, Jorge Loureiro, said that Longmuir was innocent and had been framed by an obsessed American fan he had befriended, with discs having been sent to his home anonymously days before he was arrested.
