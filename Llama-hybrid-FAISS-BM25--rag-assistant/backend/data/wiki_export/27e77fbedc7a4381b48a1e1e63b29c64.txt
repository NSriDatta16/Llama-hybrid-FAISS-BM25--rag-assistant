The 1986–87 UEFA Cup was the 16th season of the UEFA Cup, a football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) for clubs affiliated to its member associations. The competition was won by IFK Göteborg of Sweden, who beat Scotland's Dundee United 2–1 on aggregate in the final. This was the second season in which all English clubs were banned from European football competitions, preventing West Ham United, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday and Oxford United from competing.

Format
Following UEFA ranking changes and the English ban, Italy gained a fourth place from Spain, and East Germany a third one from the Netherlands.

For the 1986–87 UEFA Cup, the associations are allocated places according to their 1985 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1980–81 to 1984–85.
