Štark (pronounced: Shtark; full legal name: Soko Štark d.o.o. ) is a food manufacturing company based in Belgrade, Serbia. The main products of the company include candies, biscuits and chocolates. One of its hallmark products is Najlepše Želje a chocolate bar that means "Best Wishes" in Serbian.

History
The factory dates back to 1922 when a French soldier founded it under the name "Louit" after returning from the Thessaloniki front in World War I. He later changed it to La Cigogna. The firm grew over time into a large factory. It witnessed many political upheavals, starting as a privately owned enterprise and finally being nationalized by the state. It was joined with other smaller companies, creating one large food company in 1966 and changing the name to "Soko Štark". While it was in socialist Yugoslavia, the company was managed by the worker's organization, with workers themselves having a say in the way the company was run.

In 2001, the company changed its business type to joint-stock company and entered the public stock market, under name "Soko-Nada Štark", or shortened "Štark". In 2005, Štark was sold to Serbian company "Grand Prom".

In 2008, the Slovenian food company Droga Kolinska became majority owner of "Grand Prom". In 2010, Croatian consumer goods company Atlantic Grupa bought Slovenian food company Droga Kolinska, thus way gaining ownership over Štark. Štark products are imported into the United States by A.B Company, Inc.
