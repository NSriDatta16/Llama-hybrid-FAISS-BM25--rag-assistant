Awards

2007 Hugo Awards 

The base of the 2007 Hugo Award included a silhouette of Mount Fuji as a backdrop and a statue of the Japanese superhero Ultraman standing just taller than the iconic Hugo Award rocket.

The Hugo Award nominations were announced on 28 March 2007. A correction was issued a few days later when award officials were notified that a computing error had resulted in the film Pan's Labyrinth being left off the nomination list for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.
