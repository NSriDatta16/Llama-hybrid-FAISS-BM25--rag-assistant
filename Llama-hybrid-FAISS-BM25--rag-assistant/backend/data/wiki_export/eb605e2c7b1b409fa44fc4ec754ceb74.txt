The 11th Armoured Brigade was an armoured brigade of the British Army raised during the Second World War. The brigade was a 1st Line Territorial Army formation, consisting of three infantry battalions converted into armoured regiments.

History
The 11th Armoured Brigade was formed from the redesignation of the 126th Infantry Brigade, part of 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, on 1 November 1941. During this time, the brigade formed part of the 42nd Armoured Division. On 25 July 1942, the brigade was converted from an armoured role (equipped with cruiser tanks) into an infantry support role (equipped with infantry tanks). As part of this conversion, the brigade was re-designated the 11th Tank Brigade. During most of 1943, the brigade was attached to the 77th Infantry (Reserve) Division as a training formation. On 23 November, the brigade was disbanded and its regiments were broken up.
