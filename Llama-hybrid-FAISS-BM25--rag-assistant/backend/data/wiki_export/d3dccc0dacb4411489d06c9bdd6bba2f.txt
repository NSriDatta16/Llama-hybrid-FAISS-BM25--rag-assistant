Uddingston railway station serves the town of Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. ScotRail provides passenger services to this station on the Argyle Line and Shotts Line.

History

Overview
The first Uddingston station, on the east side of the Glasgow Road bridge, was opened by the Clydesdale Junction Railway on 1 June 1849. In 1878, it was replaced by the second one immediately west of the bridge. The station was renamed Uddingston Central (1952–1962) to avoid confusion with the nearby Uddingston (NB) renamed . The latter closing in 1955, the former reverted to Uddingston in 1962.

Prior to the 2014 Whifflet Line electrification, Argyle Line services provided through links to Central Low Level via  and then onwards to  via  northbound and to Motherwell southbound (alternate services continued to ).

Access & facilities
The building on Station Road, housing various public facilities, leads to Platform 1 (Glasgow-bound trains). A footbridge over the double track connects to Platform 2 (Motherwell/Edinburgh-bound trains) and the car park.

Enhancements
Around 2005, ScotRail, SPT and South Lanarkshire Council funded improvements that included:

 £610,000 investment in more than doubling the number of parking spaces and improving pedestrian access
 installation of an automatic ticket vending machine and renewal of ticketing system within booking office
 the opening of the "Coffee Stop"
 addition of hanging baskets and floral beds through working with the local community
 new station seating both on platforms and within the waiting room
 installation of flat-screen destination displays for both platforms and waiting area
 addition of fully accessible public toilets on Platform 1
 addition of public telephone on Platform 1
 refurbishment of the waiting room on Platform 1 to meet accessibility requirements including automatic doors and accessible ticket counter

Since 2005, a volunteer group has been responsible for beautifying the station precinct with flower beds and hanging baskets.

Free parking attracted commuters from outside the area. The proposal to expand the park and ride facility appears to have been actioned in 2019.
