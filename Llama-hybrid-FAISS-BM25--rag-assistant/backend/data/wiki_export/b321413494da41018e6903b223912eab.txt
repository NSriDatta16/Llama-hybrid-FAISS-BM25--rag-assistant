History

As Testigo (1999–2014)
Its main newscaster is Tek Ocampo, he started with Testigo (first named as Testigo: GMA Super Balita) on October 4, 1999 and made a name as a national reporter for GMA News when he left the show in 2002.  After his stint with GMA Manila, he came back to Davao to anchor the program once more.

To strengthen the regional network's commitment of bringing the latest, most credible and most comprehensive news from the region, in February 2013, the newscast started its international broadcast on GMA News TV International alongside other regional newscasts Balitang Amianan (now One North Central Luzon) and Balitang Bisdak.

Testigo ended its 15-year run on November 7, 2014.

As 24 Oras Southern Mindanao (2014–2016)
On November 10, 2014, the newscast adopts the branding of its now-main newscast 24 Oras as 24 Oras Southern Mindanao, following their change of graphics and theme music of the network's flagship newscast of the same name.

Since February 1, 2016, this program is the only GMA regional newscast to use the 24 Oras branding after two of its other regional newscasts reverted branding to its original names, Balitang Amianan (since 2008) and Balitang Bisdak (since 1999).

As 24 Oras Davao (2016–2017)
On October 3, 2016, 24 Oras Southern Mindanao changed once again its branding simply as 24 Oras Davao. The rebranding coincided to the 17th anniversary of the regional network's news department alongside GMA Cebu's Balitang Bisdak, as well as expanding out the coverage of GMA Dagupan's Balitang Amianan.

On January 2, 2017, the newscast updated its opening billboard, soundtrack and lower third graphics similar to 24 Oras, together with other sister newscasts Balitang Amianan and Balitang Bisdak.

On April 17, 2017, senior correspondent Real Sorroche was promoted as anchor of the newscast, with the launch of his own segment Usapang Real.

As GMA Regional TV One Mindanao (2017–present)
With the end of 24 Oras Davao, GMA Regional TV launched a news program scoping the entire Mindanao island called GMA Regional TV One Mindanao. The newscast is also considered as the successor for other news programs produced by GMA for Mindanao, namely 24 Oras Northern Mindanao (formerly Testigo Northern Mindanao, from 2013 to 2015) of GMA Northern Mindanao and Soccksargen Isyu Karon (from 2010 to 2011) and Flash Bulletin (from 2010 to 2015) of GMA General Santos. At the same time, GMA Cagayan de Oro reopened its studios with former relief anchor and correspondent Clyde Macascas (later replaced by Cyril Chaves, Ethel Ipanag and James Paolo Yap), which is used by the newscast. Prior to the launching of its studio, reports, and headlines from Cagayan de Oro and the rest of Northern Mindanao and Caraga are aired live from the GMA Cagayan de Oro Control Room. From Soccsksargen, BARMM and Zamboanga Peninsula (including Zamboanga City), reports and headlines are also brought by the newscast, the only used Cebuano and Filipino for the Mindanaoan-newscast from August 28, 2017 to November 22, 2019, now currently as switched full Cebuano language to the Mindanaoan-Newscast on November 25, 2019.

On July 29, 2019, the newscast unveiled a minor revision of its titlecard, changing its font color to green, reflecting it with its co-produced GMA Regional TV Weekend News (later Regional TV Weekend News, now Regional TV News), which was launched on July 27. One Mindanao was relaunched on August 19, 2019, adopting graphics and studio sets for Davao and Cagayan de Oro stations from the national newscast. In addition, the program opens its doors for viewers to become its live studio audience every Friday, similar to its sister regional newscast GMA Regional TV Balitang Bisdak.

Real Sorroche was last seen anchoring the newscast on July 1, 2021 and later eventually left the newscast on the same year due to unknown reasons. Tek Ocampo left the newscast on September 17, 2021 to run for politics and was elected as City Councilor of the 1st District of Davao City. Co-anchors-correspondents Jandi Esteban, Cyril Chaves, and Rgil Relator joined Hilomen-Velasco in the anchor team on September 20, 2021, all taking turns in anchoring the newscast, using the two-anchor format that the other regional newscasts adopted.

The program started using the newly inaugurated and opened studios of the GMA General Santos Station on March 17, 2022 and the GMA Zamboanga Station on March 24, 2022, now in tandem with the GMA Cagayan de Oro Station and GMA Davao Station. Co-anchors-news producers Efren Mamac (Tuesday to Thursday co-anchor) and Jestoni Jumamil (Monday and Friday co-anchor) were added to the newscast's roster of anchors on May 2, 2022, making the newscast to be the first GMA Regional TV newscast to adopt the 4-anchor format, albeit the anchors taking turns in anchoring the newscast.
