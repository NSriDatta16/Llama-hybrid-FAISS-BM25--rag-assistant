Angkasapuri is the main governmental building for Malaysia's Ministry of Information and it is also the headquarters for Radio Television Malaysia (RTM) located in Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

History

Pre-Angkasapuri (1946–1968)

Radio
RTM was established as Radio Malaya operating out of Singapore on 1 April 1946. Upon Malayan independence in 1957, RTM was split into two stations, with Radio Singapura taking over in Singapore while Radio Malaya moved to Federal House, Victory Avenue, Kuala Lumpur, going on air from the new location on 1 January 1959. Radio Malaya became Radio Malaysia on 16 September 1963 upon the formation of Malaysia.

Before moving into the Federal House, Radio Malaya's Kuala Lumpur activities included the setup of main office in Oriental Building at Java Street (now Jalan Tun Perak) and a temporary recording studio in Tang Ling Hospital at Young Road (now Pesiaran Raja Chulan).

Television
Television broadcasts were launched on 28 December 1963, at Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman (now the Malaysian Tourist Information Centre or MATIC), along Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur.

Angkasapuri (1968–present)
Malaysia's new broadcasting centre, named "Angkasapuri" began construction in 1966 and was complete by February 1968. Angkasapuri was officially opened by the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman on 17 February 1968. Tunku Abdul Rahman in his speech called the main building at that time as "the most beautiful" of all government buildings in the country,  while the then-Informations Minister Senu Abdul Rahman in his speech called the building as a symbol of "determination of the country to uphold truth, and freedom of thought, expression and religion" when comparing that to the Parliament building which has a similar symbolisation.

Wisma Televisyen, or Wisma TV, housing RTM's TV division opened on 6 November 1969.

Radio Malaysia became Rangkaian Nasional on 1 January 1971 and became the nation's first 24-hour radio station. Wisma Radio was added on 9 May 1972. RTM began colour TV transmissions for the States of Malaya in December 1978, in conjunction with the state broadcaster's fifteenth anniversary. The first colour programme broadcast was Puspawarna. Colour TV programmes were extended to Sabah and Sarawak in 1980.

Angkasapuri created history when a giant national flag measuring 85.3 meters long and 24.3-meters wide, using 60 rolls of fabric was unfurled by 500 employees of the Ministry of Information. The giant flag was raised for 10 minutes starting at 09:00 local time and it was witnessed by 5000 of the ministry's staff on 1 January 1988.

2012 saw the addition of Wisma Berita RTM, containing RTM's newsroom, to the Angkasapuri complex. It was inaugurated by the then-Malaysian Minister of Information, Communication, Arts and Culture, Dato' Seri Utama Dr. Rais Yatim on 6 June 2012.
