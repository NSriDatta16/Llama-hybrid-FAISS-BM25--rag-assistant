History 
The name "Hirtenberg" is derived from the name of a small castle - the Feste Huotto - which was located on a hill overlooking the valley of the Triesting.  At the end of the first Turkish war in 1532 the army of Kasim Bey was defeated in the area of Hirtenberg.
With the beginning of the 20th century some industrial companies were founded: a weaving company, the Otto Eberhardt Patronenfabrik ammunition factory (with a KZ Mauthausen subcamp), and a steel-producing company. Because of this fact the coat of arms of Hirtenberg contains an industrial building with three chimneys.  The big companies are now far smaller and employ far fewer people than before and turned to produce different things like airbag ignitions, steel lockers or car rims.
