The road heads northeast through woodland and marshy lakes, eventually turning north into dense forests. The route crosses a Winchester and Western Railroad line before turning northeast and crossing CR 718. At this point, CR 555 forms the border between Downe Township to the northwest and Commercial Township to the southeast, intersecting CR 767. The road crosses the Buckshutem Creek into Millville and crosses CR 670, at which point the road enters a mix of woods and fields, passing to the east of New Jersey Motorsports Park and Millville Municipal Airport. CR 555 comes to a junction with CR 627 and turns north onto Silver Run Road, running through woodland a short distance to the west of the Maurice River. The road enters wooded areas of residential and industrial development before intersecting CR 610, at which point CR 555 turns northeast onto Cedarville Avenue and passing homes. CR 555 intersects Route 49 and turns east to form a concurrency with that route on Main Street. The route crosses the Maurice River and enters downtown Millville, where it intersects Route 47.

Past Route 47, CR 555 splits from Route 49 by turning north onto Third Street. The route passes areas of homes a block to the east of Route 47, crossing a Winchester and Western Railroad line and intersecting CR 552 Spur. Past the CR 552 Spur junction, CR 555 turns northeast onto Wheaton Avenue and runs near more residences before heading into industrial areas. The route enters residential areas again before intersecting CR 678, where it heads into Vineland. A short distance later, the road interchanges with the Route 55 freeway and comes to the junction with CR 655. CR 555 continues into wooded areas of homes as South Main Road, crossing CR 552. The route continues north into more dense residential development and widens into a four lane road as it enters a mix of homes and businesses, with CR 540 joining the route for a brief concurrency. Past CR 540, CR 555 continues north past more commercial development on North Main Road, becoming a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it reaches an intersection with CR 681 and crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track line. The road continues into a mix of farms and development, narrowing back to two lanes at the CR 619 junction.

CR 555 enters Franklin Township in Gloucester County and heads north into forested areas as Main Road. The road continues through mostly wooded areas with some farms and homes as it comes to the intersection with US 40. Past this junction, the route heads into more agricultural areas with some woods and homes before heading into dense forests with residences.

A short distance later, the route crosses CR 538 and heads northwest through more wooded areas of homes with occasional farm fields. The road turns more to the north near Southern Cross Airport as it enters Monroe Township and comes to intersections with CR 612 and CR 610 before crossing US 322/CR 536.
