The 43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron (43 AES) is an inactive unit of the United States Air Force; it was part of the 43d Air Mobility Operations Group at Pope Army Air Field, North Carolina. As the only active duty tactical aeromedical evacuation unit in the U.S. Air Force the 43d provided tactical aeromedical evacuation for U.S. troops and regional Unified Commands using C-130 Hercules and other aircraft. The unit was manned by Flight Nurses, Medical Service Corps Officers, Aeromedical Evacuation Technicians, medical administration and logistics technicians, and radio and communications operators. The squadron was inactivated on 8 June 2020 and moved to Travis AFB, California becoming the 60th AES.

History
The unit traces its roots to the 1st Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron which was activated at Pope AFB in 1975. On 31 March 1997, the 43rd AES was constituted as the result of a change in its parent wing, having previously been the 23d AES; on 1 April 1997 it was activated as part of the 43d Airlift Wing under Air Mobility Command.

In April 1999, the 43 AES deployed to Tirana, Albania in support of Operation Noble Anvil. As part of Task Force Hawk, AES personnel provided support to Army V Corps. Twenty-seven missions were flown on opportune C-17 and C-130 aircraft resulting in the safe and timely transfer of service members to include one injured security police dog.

On 7 October 2001, The US began its war on terrorism and Operation Enduring Freedom began.  Later that month, personnel from the 43 AES, were the first aeromedical forces to deploy overseas. Since January 2003 members of the 43 AES have been deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Members of the 43 AES also deployed in support of joint operations related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005.

43 AES became part of the 43d Airlift Group on 1 March 2011 when the 43d Airlift Wing inactivated.

In July 2014 the squadron was participating in an exercise involving a hostage rescue scenario, when Staff Sergeant Timothy Wright was struck and killed by a Humvee.  Despite immediate response measures, SSgt Wright died of his injuries a short time later.  Col. Elizabeth Shaw, the unit commander, was relieved "due to a loss of confidence in her ability to command" following the release of the ground accident investigation board report.  Lt. Col. Russ Frantz was named interim squadron commander pending appointment of a new commander.
