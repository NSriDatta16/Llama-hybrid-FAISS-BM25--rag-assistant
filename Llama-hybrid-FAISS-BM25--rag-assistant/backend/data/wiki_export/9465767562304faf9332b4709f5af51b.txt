Subsequently, the penalty was scored by David Dunn. On 29 March 2010, Olsson admitted to the dive, Rovers manager, Sam Allardyce defended Olsson by saying he was his man of the match and created havoc and chaos in and around the eighteen yard box all match.

In June 2010, Olsson signed a new five-year-deal at Blackburn Rovers that would keep him at the club until summer 2015. At the start of the 2010–11 season, Olsson acquired the number three jersey by manager Sam Allardyce, which he had for most of pre-season. He featured in Rovers' opening 2010–11 Premier League match against Everton at Ewood Park on 14 August 2010, playing the full 90 minutes on the left-wing in a 1–0 victory.

At the end of the season, he made 32 appearances for Rovers in total and scored two goals in all competitions.

Now considered a key player, Olsson started off the season at left back covering for Gaël Givet who himself was covering for various injuries at centre back. Olsson provided an assist in a 4–3 victory over Arsenal. After running from the halfway line to the by-line, he pulled back a cross for Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny to score an own goal.

Olsson played in all three matches including the 2–0 victory over Middlesbrough in the final at Wembley Stadium, which saw Norwich return to the Premier League at the first attempt.

He would however score a dramatic winner on 2 April 2016 against Newcastle United. With the match 2–2 going into stoppage time, Olsson scored with a long-distance shot to give Norwich a 3–2 win. The win was ultimately in vain however, as Norwich were relegated to the Championship again at the end of the season.

Olsson became a first team regular in the 2017–18 season, making a total of 36 appearances, but could not prevent the club with relegation at the end of that season. This meant that Olsson was set for a fourth Premier League relegation, same as Robert Green and former Norwich teammate Sébastien Bassong, but one off the current record holders Hermann Hreiðarsson and Nathan Blake.
