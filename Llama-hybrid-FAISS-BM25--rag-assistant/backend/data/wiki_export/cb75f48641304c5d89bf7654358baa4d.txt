Francis Burton Craige (March 13, 1811 – December 30, 1875) was an editor, lawyer, and U.S. congressional representative from the south fork of the Yadkin River five miles from Salisbury, North Carolina.  He was the youngest son of David and Mary Foster Craige.

Personal life 
As a child, he attended a classical private school in Salisbury and in 1829, he graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1832 at the age of just 21, commencing practice in Salisbury. In 1836 Craige married Elizabeth Phifer Erwin, granddaughter of Matthew Locke (U.S. Congress) and had 5 children; James Alexander was born in 1841, Kerr in 1843, Francis Burton, Jr., in 1846, Mary Elizabeth in 1848, and Annie Erwin in 1852.

Craige died in Concord, North Carolina on December 30, 1875, while attending the Cabarrus County Superior Court. He was buried in the Old English Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina.

While studying law, Craige was an editor and proprietor of the newspaper Salisbury Western Carolinian (1829-1831). Under his editorship, he made the newspaper one of chief advocates of Nullification in North Carolina, suggesting full co-operation with South Carolina in its ongoing dispute with Andrew Jackson.

Craige was one of the last borough representatives in the State House of Representatives from 1832 to 1834. In 1835, Craige was defeated by Abraham Rencher while challenging him for his seat in Congress.

Later in his career, he was elected as a Democrat from the 33rd to the 36th U.S. Congresses (March 4, 1853 – March 3, 1861).
