Tempo, historically called Tempodeshel (), is a small village at the foot of Brougher Mountain in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The Census of 2011 recorded a population of 489 people. It lies within the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council area.

History
The name An tIompú Deiseal ("the right-hand turn") may refer to a bend in the Tempo River near the village. There is a local legend that Saint Patrick left a manuscript here on his way to Enniskillen and that he told his servant to "turn right" to go back and retrieve it.

On 25 October 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) raided the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks in Tempo for weapons. RIC sergeant Samuel Lucas was shot and fatally wounded, but a group of armed Ulster Volunteers arrived and drove off the IRA unit. Shortly after, a Catholic civilian with republican sympathies, Philip Breen, was shot in the doorway of his family's pub in the village and later died of his wounds.

Tempo is the birthplace of Young Irelander Terence MacManus, one of the leaders of the 1848 Rebellion.
