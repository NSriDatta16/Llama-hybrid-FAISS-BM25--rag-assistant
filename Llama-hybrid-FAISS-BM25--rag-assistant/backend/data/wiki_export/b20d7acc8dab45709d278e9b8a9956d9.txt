Live performances 
Despite releasing three albums, Langsomt Mot Nord has only performed live a few times.

They appeared at the TopPop program at NRK TV during the release of Westrveg. The show was recorded at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, featuring Steinar Ofsdal, Eva Knardahl and Atle Sponberg. During the Westrveg-period, LMN's use of sampling-technology was on its peak: In the TopPop-performance, one could count no less than seven S series AKAI-samplers stacked on top of each other near the middle of the stage. This was somewhat unusual at the time, and the group's extensive use of samplers and computers in their works based on Norwegian traditional music was debated in Norwegian media for some time.

During the release of Hildring, they appeared at the Rock On Top Of Europe festival in Hammerfest and afterwards did a few gigs: Among them, one at the Student Society in Trondheim, featuring deLillos, Raga Rockers and Langsomt Mot Nord, and one at the Rockefeller Music Hall in Oslo, in company with "Fläskkvartetten" (Fleshquartet), Stengte Dører and Einmal Kommt die Liebe.

The group released a music video, for the tune "Ola Drar Til Myklagard" starring Lars Lillo-Stenberg, promoting their first album, Langsomt mot Nord.

Musical style 
The music of Langsomt Mot Nord (LMN) is derived from Norwegian traditional music.  Many of the recordings are based upon older recordings of traditional tunes, performed on original instruments by Ola Snortheim's father, the folk-musician Olav Snortheim. The music is accentuated and arranged in new ways by extensive use of electronic instruments like synthesizers and samplers. However, the band also takes the traditional music in new directions by the use of acoustic instruments, such as strings, piano and woodwind.

Personnel
Each album by Langsomt Mot Nord has featured a different line up.
