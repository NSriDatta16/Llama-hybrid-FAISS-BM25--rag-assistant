"Parler tout bas" (English: "Speak Softly") is the third single by Alizée released in April 2001. It featured an instrumental rendition of the song in addition to Alizée's solo rendering.

Music video
The video for the song features Alizée in an outdoors bedroom with toys and later, in a forest. The subject of the video seems to be the little teddy bear in her arms. Her act of burying the teddy bear (later in the video, while in the forest) could be a sign of leaving childlike innocence behind.
The actor in the video (Jérome Devoise) also appeared in the video for "Moi... Lolita".
The video premiered on 25 April 2001 and was directed by Laurent Boutonnat. It premiered on M6.
