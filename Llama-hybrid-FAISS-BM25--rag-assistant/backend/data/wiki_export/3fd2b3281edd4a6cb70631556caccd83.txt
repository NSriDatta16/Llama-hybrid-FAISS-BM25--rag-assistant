The lead vocals were sung by Jordan Knight. Danny Wood sang "Step 1", Donnie Wahlberg sang "Step 2", Jordan Knight sang "Step 3", Joey McIntyre sang "Step 4", and Jonathan Knight sang "Step 5".

"Step by Step" was initially recorded by one of Maurice Starr's other groups, The Superiors.  It was released as a single in 1987 on Motown Records but it was not successful. The New Kids cover of the song on the other hand was a huge worldwide hit, becoming one of the biggest selling singles of 1990. The New Kids on the Block's cover spent three weeks at No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was eventually certified platinum; it also spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Canadian Singles Chart, in total "Step by Step" spent five weeks at No. 1 in the North American charts. It also peaked at No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart and was also a top 10 hit in the Australian, French, West German, Irish and Norwegian charts.

Critical reception
Bill Coleman from Billboard wrote, "Unstoppable teen idols preview upcoming album of the same name with a perky pop/dance confection rife with disco-era string fills. The phenomenon continues." Greg Sandow from Entertainment Weekly praised "Step by Step" as "a wonderfully ingratiating morsel of pop. Itâ€™s nourished by a chugging beat and (for dessert, so to speak) offers perky disco strings and a brief flash of silver falsetto from New Kid Jordan Knight." Ben Thompson  from NME commented, "The New Kids can be forgiven a certain caution as to where they are putting their feet, given their recent run-in with a malevolent cuddly toy. Excepting some nice Saturday Night Fever fake strings, all potential points of interest have been relentlessly expunged from this record." In their review of the album, People Magazine found that the music "is in fact better in spots than on their previous effort", noting that the song is "funkier". Rolling Stone described it as "a peppy reintroduction to the group that breaks up its generalized pledges of devotion with quick spots from each member, one-liners coyly called "ad libs" on the lyric sheet, although they're faithfully printed. (Nothing but nothing on this record happens by chance.)"

Music video
The accompanying music video for "Step by Step" was directed by American director Larry Jordan. Donnie Wahlberg's brother Mark Wahlberg also appears in the video.
