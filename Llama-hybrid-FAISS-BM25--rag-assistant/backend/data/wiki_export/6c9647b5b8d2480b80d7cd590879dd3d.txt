History

World War II
The Second Amphibian Tractor Battalion was commissioned on March 18, 1942, in San Diego, California. The battalion was an organic unit of the 2nd Marine Division, composed of a Headquarters and Service Company and three letter companies, all equipped with the Landing Vehicle Tracked-1 (LVT-1).

Guadalcanal
In November 1942 the battalion was relocated to Wellington, New Zealand where it continued training for follow on amphibious operations.  Company H from 2d Tracks arrived at Tulagi on October 9 as part of other reinforcements from the 2nd Marine Division.

Tarawa
The battalion left New Zealand along with the rest of the 2nd Marine Division on November 1, 1943.  While participating in a practice landing against Mele Bay, Efate on November 8, the battalion was also preparing to receive 50 new LVT-2 amphibian tractors.  The new LVT-2s were placed into Company A-1 which was stood up with additional personnel from the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 2d Light Tank Battalion and 2d Special Weapons Battalion. Tarawa marked the first time the LVT-2 Water Buffalo participated in combat operations. The battalion's LVTs took part in the first, second, and third waves of landings at Tarawa on November 20, 1943.  The first wave across the beach consisted of 42 LVT-1s each carrying 18 Marines and 45 LVT-2's each with 20 Marines.  

The battalion's LVTs provided a continuous supply of ammunition, reinforcements, and ferrying back of the wounded. Of 125 vehicles used (50 new LVT-2s and 75 LVT-1s), only 35 remained operational by the end of the first day, continuing to ferry men and supplies across the coral reef and through the shallows to the beach.  The Battle of Tarawa resulted in 32 killed in action and 68 missing Marines for the battalion.  Among the dead was the battalion's commanding officer, Major Henry C. Drewes, who was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions under fire before being killed on the first day of the battle.  Following the assault on Tarawa the battalion was sent to Hawaii where it established itself at the newly created Camp Henry C. Drewes and began receiving new equipment, men and supplies and also began training for its next combat operation.

Saipan & Tinian
In May 1944 the decision was made to assign the battalion to the V Amphibious Corps vice the 2nd Marine Division.  This was revised in September 1944 when the battalion was again reassigned to Fleet Marine Forces, Pacific.  LVT-4s from the 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion, again transporting Marines from the 2d Marine Division, came ashore at Saipan, south of Garapan at 0843 on June 15, 1944.

On July 24, 1944 the 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion with 96 LVT-2s and 40 LVT-4s, brought the 24th Marine Regiment ashore during the Battle of Tinian,

The 2nd Amphibian Tractor Battalion was reactivated on May 1, 1946.
