The County of Stanley is a cadastral division centred on the city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, that is used mainly for the purpose of registering land titles. It was named after Edward Stanley, who was three times British prime minister in the 1850s and 1860s. It is bounded by the Logan River in the south, the Brisbane River at what is now Lake Wivenhoe in the west, the Stanley River at what is now Lake Somerset in the north-west, and Caboolture River in the north. It includes Moreton Island and Stradbroke Island, and extends west to Ipswich's CBD, south to Loganlea and north to Morayfield.
