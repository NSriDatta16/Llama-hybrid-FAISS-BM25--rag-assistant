Stage Front Stadium, also known as Estadi Cornellà-El Prat (;  ), is an all-seater football stadium on the outskirts of Cornellà de Llobregat and El Prat de Llobregat, in the wider Barcelona urban area (Catalonia, Spain). It took three years to build and cost approximately €60 million. Opened in August 2009, it was awarded as Venue of the Year at the Stadium Business Awards on 18 June 2010 in Dublin.
 
With a capacity of 40,000 seats. it is the 10th-largest stadium in Spain and the 3rd-largest in Catalonia. It became the home of RCD Espanyol in 2009, replacing their previous stadium, the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, being the 8th stadium in the club's history.

History
The stadium is known as the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat because it is located on the borders of the municipalities Cornellà and El Prat. The club hopes to find a buyer for the naming rights for the stadium.

Espanyol defeated Liverpool 3–0 in the stadium's inaugural match on 2 August 2009.

After the death of club captain Daniel Jarque on 8 August 2009, just six days after the inaugural match, it was proposed that the stadium should be renamed in his honour. However, the club has not taken a definite stance on the subject.

In July 2014, the stadium was renamed as Power8 Stadium for sponsorship reasons. It was discovered that Power8 was an investment fraud which duped 100s of Asian investors, organised by Bryan Cook and Thomas Yi of London Capital. In January 2016, the club renamed the stadium as RCDE Stadium ending the sponsorship of Power8.

In June 2023, RCD Espanyol de Barcelona and the North American company Stage Front reached a sponsorship agreement to rename the Espanyol Stadium as thr Stage Front Stadium.
