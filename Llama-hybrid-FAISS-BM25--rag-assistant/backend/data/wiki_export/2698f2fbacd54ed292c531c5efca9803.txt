He is the father of six children:  Marilyn, Edsel, Jr., Carol, Kenneth, Carlton, and singer Lila.  Bishop Ammons is married to Helen Ammons, the former Director of Student Life at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, Evanston, Illinois.

Ammons was ordained, both deacon and elder, in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (1947 and 1949), pastoring churches of that denomination in Chicago and in Highland Falls, New York.  Edsel was a social case worker for the Department of Welfare of Cook County, Illinois (1951–56).  In 1957, under the influence of Bishop Charles Wesley Brashares, Ammons transferred into the Rock River Annual Conference of the Methodist Church, and was appointed to the Whitfield Methodist Church in Chicago (which became the Ingleside-Whitfield Methodist Parish).  He served this church until 1963, when he became director of urban ministry for the Rockford District.  In 1966, he was appointed to the program staff of the Annual Conference.

Ammons joined the faculty of Garrett Theological Seminary in 1968, remaining in this position until elected to the episcopacy in 1976.

Ammons served as the president of the U.M. General Board of Discipleship (1980–84), the chairperson of the Health and Welfare Program Department (1984–88), and chairperson of the Missionary Personnel and Resources Program Department (1988–92) of the General Board of Global Ministries.
