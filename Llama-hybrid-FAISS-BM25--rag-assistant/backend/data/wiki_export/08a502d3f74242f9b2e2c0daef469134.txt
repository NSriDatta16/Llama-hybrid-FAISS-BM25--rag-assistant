Weekly Reader Publishing was a publisher of educational materials in the United States that had been in existence for over 100 years. It provided teaching materials to elementary and secondary schools that was used by more than 90 percent of that country's school districts.

Overview
The company’s flagship publication was Weekly Reader, a grade-specific classroom magazine that served elementary students in over 50,000 schools across the country. 

Weekly Reader also published branded periodicals and instructional materials for middle and high school students, along with a full range of supplementary educational materials for grades Pre-K–9.  These curriculum-specific products included classroom magazines, workbooks, reproducibles, early learning centers, and more.

The company’s age- and grade-appropriate elementary and secondary publications integrated reading, writing, science, math, social studies, current events, and life skills topics into “news-style” classroom magazines and other formats.

The company, by then known as American Education Publications, was purchased for $8.6 million in 1949 by Wesleyan University, which sold it in 1965 to Xerox Corp. in exchange for $56 million in stock.

In 2007, Weekly Reader Corporation became part of The Reader's Digest Association, based in Chappaqua, New York. Weekly Reader's main office was relocated from Stamford, Connecticut, to Chappaqua at the end of May 2007.

It was acquired by Scholastic Corporation in 2012, which shut down its title publications and integrated the company into its Scholastic News division.
