STNNNG (pronounced 'Stunning') was an American noise rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Formed in 2003, they played over 400 live shows in the United States, England, France, and Belgium. STNNNG released four full-length albums on the Twin Cities-based Modern Radio record label before splitting up in 2017.

History
For their first two years as a band, STNNNG performed as the quartet of Chris Besinger (vocals), Adam Burt (guitar), Nathan Nelson (guitar), and J. Michael Ward (drums). Their first releases, 2004's split 7-inch with Chicago's The Means and 2005's debut album, Dignified Sissy, were recorded with this lineup. The cover of Dignified Sissy features Bear Attack, a painting by historical artist Mort Kunstler.

STNNNG took first place in the annual "Picked To Click" band poll in Minneapolis' City Pages in 2005. 

STNNNG's second album, Fake Fake, was the first to feature Jesse Kwakenat (also of Heroine Sheiks) on bass. Fake Fake was recorded and engineered by Mike Lust at Lust Manor in Chicago.

STNNNG's 3rd full-length album, The Smoke of My Will, was released in October 2010. The album was the band's first after the departure of original drummer J. Michael Ward in August 2009. He was replaced by Ben Ivascu (also known for playing drums in Poli√ßa, Marijuana Death Squads, and Signal to Trust) as a permanent member.

In February 2013, STNNNG released Empire Inward, an eight-song album recorded at Electrical Audio studio in Chicago, Illinois, and engineered and mixed by Steve Albini.

In 2017 they released Veterans of Pleasure, the band's final album, on which they again worked with Albini.

STNNNG announced their immediate disbanding after a show in September 2017. 

The band's final release was a split EP with Child Bite, released in November 2017.
