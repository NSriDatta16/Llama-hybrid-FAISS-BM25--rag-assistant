Hieracon or Hierakon (, Ptolemy vi. 7. § 36), also called Theracon, Egyptian pr nmty, was an ancient fortified city of Upper Egypt situated on the right bank of the Nile, now the site of the modern-day village of Elatawlah, Egypt. Here, in Roman times, was quartered the cohors prima of the Lusitanian auxiliaries. It stood nearly midway between the western extremity of the  or Alabstrine Mountains (the site of the Kom al-Ahmar Necropolis) and the city of Asyut (Greek Lycopolis), latitude 27° 15′North.

Hieracon is distinct from Nekhen (, Hierakon polis Strabo xvii. p. 817), which was south of Thebes, lat. 25° 52′North, nearly opposite Eileithyias polis (, Egyptian Nekheb, modern El Kab), and capital of the third nome of Upper Egypt.
