In popular culture
Damon Runyon referenced Oro in his short story "Madame La Gimp", showing his name to be widely known in 1920s New York:

"Well, when I step in I see the judge miss a shot anybody can make blindfolded, but as soon as I give him the office I wish to speak to him, the judge hauls off and belts in every ball on the table, bingity-bing, the last shot being a bank that will make Al de Oro stop and think, because when it comes to pool, the old judge is just naturally a curly wolf."
