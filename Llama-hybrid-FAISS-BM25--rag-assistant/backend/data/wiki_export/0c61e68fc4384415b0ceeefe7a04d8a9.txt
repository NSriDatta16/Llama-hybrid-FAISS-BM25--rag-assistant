During his football career, Van Camp worked part-time as a security guard at the Louisville Gardens. During a show by the professional wrestling promotion Continental Championship Wrestling, his large frame impressed several of the wrestlers, and promoter Jerry Lawler invited him to come to the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee, to train as a professional wrestler.

Professional wrestling career 
Van Camp was trained to wrestle by Lawler, making his debut for Continental Championship Wrestling in 1983.

In 1984, Van Camp joined the Indianapolis-based World Wrestling Association. On January 7, 1984, Van Camp and Dick the Bruiser defeated Abdullah the Great and Jerry Valiant to win the WWA World Tag Team Championship. The duo held the championship until September of that year where they were defeated by the Wild Warriors (Mad Maxx and Super Maxx).

In late 1984, Van Camp moved on to a wrestling promotion closer to his home in Florida as he began working for Southeast Championship Wrestling (SECW) out of Alabama.

He was brought in by SECW's main bad guy Ron Fuller to target the promotions top good guys. His first storyline feud saw him win the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship from Porkchop Cash in September, 1984 only weeks after starting with the promotion. He would hold on to the title into 1985 where he would lose it to and then regain it from Johnny Rich as part of an ongoing storyline. On March 4, 1985 Austin Idol ended Lord Humongous' second run with the championship. Once Lord Humongous regained the title on April 6, 1985, he became involved in a storyline where Ron Fuller started to feel remorse over the Humongous' actions. This led to Humongous turning face (wrestling term for those that portray the "good guys") and started to fight against Lord Humongous. Fuller ended Humongous' third and final fall on June 17, 1985. Following that he moved onto a storyline feud with The Flame, from whom he won the NWA Southeast Continental Heavyweight Championship in July 1985, only to lose it back to the Flame a few weeks later.
