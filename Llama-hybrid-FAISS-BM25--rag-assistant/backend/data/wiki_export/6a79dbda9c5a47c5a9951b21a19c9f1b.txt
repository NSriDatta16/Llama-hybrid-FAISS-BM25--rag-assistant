Synopsis
Silvio wants to take action against Native Americans protesting the Columbus Day parade, believing their actions to be insulting to Italian-Americans. When, without Tony's approval, he, Patsy, and Artie attempt to break up the protest, Little Paulie and several others are injured. Ralphie threatens the protest leader, Professor Del Redclay, that he will make it known that Iron Eyes Cody, a popular Native American figure, was actually an Italian-American. Tony unsuccessfully appeals to Assemblyman Ron Zellman and to an Indian chief to convince Redclay to cancel the protest. The chief invites Tony and his crew to his casino. Both the parade and protest occur without mob intervention, which upsets Silvio. Tony forcefully argues to Silvio that his achievements came through his own abilities, not through his heritage, and scorns the idea that everyone belongs to a victimized group.

At a luncheon meant to instill Italian pride in women, the "mob wives" feel singled out when the speaker attempts to dissociate Italian culture from the Mafia. After the luncheon, Gabriella lectures Father Phil about how much the mob wives, especially Carmela, have given to the parish, and says he had no right to bring in a guest speaker who intended to shame them.

The Soprano and Lupertazzi families meet over a meal: Johnny, speaking for Carmine, demands a share of the profit Tony made from Junior's warehouse, which was recently flipped. Tony agrees, but comes to the conclusion that someone from his organization is leaking information to the Lupertazzi family. Now that Johnny knows of Ralphie's joke about his wife, he is furiously hostile to him, but will not say why. 
 
Bobby's wife Karen is killed in a road accident. The mob wives feel sympathy for Bobby during the wake and discuss his having never taken a comare. Spending time with him in his home, Janice is touched by his sincere grief.

Shortly after Ralphie leaves Rosalie, Janice allows him to move in with her; but after a discussion with her therapist, she wills herself to break up with him. When he comes home with his baggage, she yells at him to leave and pushes him down the stairs, injuring his back. Janice locks herself in her room as Ralphie hobbles back to his car, bags in hand.

Production
 Dan Castleman, who plays a prosecutor with the same name on the series, first appearing in this episode, also acts as a consultant for the show's writers, giving them expert advice on their questions about legal matters dealing with the Mafia. In his real-life career, Castleman spent 30 years in the Manhattan District Attorney's office as chief of the Rackets Bureau and then of Investigations. Castleman would be credited for his contributions and given the title of a technical adviser starting with the second part of Season Six.
