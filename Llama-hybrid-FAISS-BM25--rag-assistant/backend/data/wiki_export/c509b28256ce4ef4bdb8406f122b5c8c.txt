On Sunday 18 December 1864, a small building on Petrie Terrace was inaugurated for Baptist services and Sunday School. In January 1895 a new Petrie Terrace Baptist church opened on the corner of Hale Street and Judge Street (). It was built behind the former church (built circa 1870) which faced Chapel Street. The 1895 church building is still extant but converted to a private residence; it is listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register.

Local people began to agitate for a school in February 1865, claiming at least 120 children would enrol. In February 1886,  of land was reserved for a school. Petrie Terrace State School opened in March 1868. In 1875 the school was split into Petrie Terrace Boys State School and Petrie Terrace Girls and Infants State School. In 1953 the schools were re-organised to form Petrie Terrace State School and Petrie Terrace Infants State School. Circa 1953-1954 opportunity classes were added to the Infant School for children with special needs. In 1960, another reorganisation of the schools took place, resulting in two schools Petrie Terrace State School (incorporating the infants) and the Petrie Terrace Opportunity School.

The lodge was established in 1873, to meet the needs of a large working class population without protection against injury, illness or other hardships. Baroona Hall is also associated with Brisbane architect, Richard Gailey as an example of his work and who designed many notable commercial and residential buildings including the Oddfellows Hall in Fortitude Valley and a Masonic Hall at Toowong. In 1918, the hall was leased to Isidor Josephson, a clothing manufacturer who built a substantial business which eventually extended to most other states. The hall was utilised by the lodge and the community for a number of years and the shops were continually occupied by a number of small businesses including bakers, stationers, hairdressers, bootmakers, drapers, and the Caxton Street Legal Services from 1976. A shop at the front was for many years, famously, the location of Tony Frangos, a traditional European style tailor. The Hall at the back was also an infamous live band venue where many Brisbane rock acts, as well as interstate acts played between 1975 and 1985. The building houses the "Velvet Cigar Strip Club".

The theatre opened on 16 September 1961 with a performance of The Multi-Coloured Umbrella by Armidale playwright Barbara Mary Vernon. The theatre was badly damaged by a fire on 31 May 1964, reopening on 15 June 1965.

On Sunday 6 July 1952, Duhig returned to open and dedicate the new church to St Thomas More.
