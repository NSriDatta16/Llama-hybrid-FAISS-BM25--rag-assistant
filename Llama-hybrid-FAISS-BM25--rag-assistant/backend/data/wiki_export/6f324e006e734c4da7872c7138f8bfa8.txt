Raymond Peter Allison (born March 4, 1959) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward who played seven seasons in the National Hockey League for the Hartford Whalers and Philadelphia Flyers. He featured in the 1985 Stanley Cup Finals with the Flyers.

Allison was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia.

Playing career
Following a phenomenal junior career, Allison became the first ever draft pick in the history of the Hartford Whalers/Carolina Hurricanes franchise. He was expected to be a franchise player but failed to impress during his rookie season. A year later, Allison was traded in a ten player deal to Philadelphia. There he would develop into a scoring forward but suffered a broken ankle during the 1982–83 season. He never regained a regular spot on the Flyers roster, and played his last few seasons in the AHL and Swiss leagues.
