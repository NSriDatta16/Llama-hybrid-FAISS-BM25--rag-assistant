Shunza (born 1973) is a Chinese–American singer-songwriter known for her "velvet" voice and love ballads. Unlike most pop idols who perform in front of screaming fans, Shunza's concerts are more intimate and cocktail-style. Over the course of her career, she has collaborated with Taiwanese artists such as Elva Hsiao and Will Pan.

Early life
Ni Shunzi was born on February 12, 1973, as the youngest of two children. Her father was a clarinet player, while her mother was a well-known pianist. At the age of three, she, her mother, and her older sister moved from Beijing to the San Francisco Bay Area as a result of divorce. Upon graduating high school, Shunza studied at the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in Lausanne, Switzerland EJMA – http://www.ejma.ch. It was there that she founded a band called Duty Free, releasing a few works in Europe. In 1994, Magic Stone Music, a subsidiary of Rock Records, received one of her demo tapes, and consequently signed her to a record contract.

Musical career
Since her debut, Shunza has released numerous albums in Mandarin, Japanese, English, and French. In 1999, she was hailed as the Best Female Singer and Best Composer at the 10th Golden Melody Awards. In October 2000, Shunza signed on with EMI, joining Cantopop sensation Faye Wong.
