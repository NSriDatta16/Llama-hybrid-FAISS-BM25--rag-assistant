Selve Automobilwerke AG was a car maker located in Hameln (near Hannover, Germany).

The 40 hp 2090 cc model (which was later carried over to the 40 hp and 2352 cc) was also available in a  sport version. Six-cylinder models of 2850 cc in engine displacement were produced in 1925 and the Selecta 3075 cc engine produced in 1927 completed the product line.
