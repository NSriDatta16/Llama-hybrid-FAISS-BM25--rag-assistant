Diphu Pass is a mountain pass around the area of the disputed tri-point borders of India, China, and Myanmar. Diphu Pass is also a strategic approach to eastern Arunachal Pradesh in India. It lies on the McMahon Line.
Nearest air connectivity is 60km away at Walong airstrip.

Geography
It is located in Anjaw district of Arunachal Pradesh, 120 km northeast of district headquarter at Hawai via Hawai-Walong-Dong-Kibithu-Kaho-Dhipu Pass route. Kaho on LAC is 40 km west of Dhipu Pass.

History
In October 1960, China and Burma demarcated their border to the Diphu Pass, which is 5 miles south of the watershed of the mountain ranges. However, this caused a diplomatic row with India, which expected the tri-point to be at the watershed. The dispute has become part of the ongoing border disagreement between China and India regarding Arunachal Pradesh.
