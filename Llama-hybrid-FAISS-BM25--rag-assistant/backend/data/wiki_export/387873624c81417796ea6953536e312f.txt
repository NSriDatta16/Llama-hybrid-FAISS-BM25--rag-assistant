Marco Taddei Né (born 17 July 1983) is an Ivorian former football midfielder.

Career
Né had a pre-season trial period with Arsenal F.C. in 2004 along with fellow Ivorian player Emmanuel Eboué, but unlike Eboué, Né failed to secure a transfer to the Premiership side.

He was signed by Olympiacos C.F.P. to replace Yaya Touré, who departed for AS Monaco, but failed to break into the first team due to constant injury problems for the majority of his spell at the club. Failing to leave an impression, Né was released by Olympiacos C.F.P. in the winter transfer period of 2008.

On 22 January 2009 Né signed a three-year contract with FC Kuban Krasnodar. In February he received a knee injury and missed the entire season.
