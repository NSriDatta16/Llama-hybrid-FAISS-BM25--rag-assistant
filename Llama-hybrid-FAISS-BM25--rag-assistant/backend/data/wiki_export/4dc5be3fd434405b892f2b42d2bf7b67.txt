Deen Maar Indigenous Protected Area is an Indigenous Protected Area (IPA) located in south-west Victoria, Australia, on land bounded by the Eumeralla River and Bass Strait. The nearest town is Yambuk.

History
In 1842 Deen Maar was the site of conflict between the Indigenous people of the area and European colonists. This conflict is referred to as the Eumerella Wars and took place over 20 years in the mid-19th century. The remains of people involved in the conflict are at Deen Maar.

The property was purchased in 1993 by ATSIC for the Framlingham Aboriginal Trust with the intention that it become an Indigenous Protected Area, and it was granted this status in 1999. It was the first IPA in Victoria.

Description

It is the traditional home of the Peek Whurrong speakers of the Dhauwurdwurung (Gunditjmara) nation.
