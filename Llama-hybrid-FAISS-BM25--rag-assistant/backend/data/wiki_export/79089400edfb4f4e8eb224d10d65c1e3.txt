Leinil Francis Yu (born 1977) is a Filipino comic book artist, who began working for the American market through Wildstorm Productions.

Career

Leinil Francis Yu was first recognized after winning the Wizards Drawing Board Contest, his first published work. He was first hired by Whilce Portacio to do some work for Wildstorm and started his comic book artist's career on Aster: The Last Celestial Knight #3 (with Ronaldo Roxas) in the mid-1990s, but that work fell through. Portacio then passed on samples of Yu's work to Marvel Comics, who subsequently hired him to work on Wolverine.

After his run on Wolverine he moved on to work on Marvel's core X-Men title in 2000, which was being written by Chris Claremont at the time. Yu continued to work on other Marvel titles such as Fantastic Four, Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk and New Avengers. He also co-created High Roads with writer Scott Lobdell at Cliffhanger, and Superman: Birthright with Mark Waid and Silent Dragon with Andy Diggle at DC Comics.

His run on Marvel's New Avengers series ended with #37 so he could begin working on Secret Invasion, which was written by Brian Michael Bendis. He also completed his work on the long-delayed Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk series after finishing the miniseries Secret Invasion, before going on to work on Ultimate Comics: Avengers 2 with writer Mark Millar.

Yu was commissioned to design the cover for The Pin-Up Girls' 2001 debut album Hello Pain, and the internationally released Taste Test EP.

Yu was a conceptual artist on the 2005 feature film Serenity.

On April 9, 2011, Yu was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9am scripting a 20-page black and white Superior comic book, with Yu providing the book's front cover, and the other artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering, including Dave Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Sean Phillips and Liam Sharp, who all drew a panel each. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on November 23, 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children's Foundation.

Yu formed the band Marty McFly along with college friends and has produced a self made album.

He drew Avengers #30, a "jam issue", featuring splash pages by various artists including Walt Simonson and Jim Cheung.

In 2018 Marvel relaunched a new volume of Captain America, with Yu as artist.

In 2019, Yu created the first Filipino superhero "Wave" who first appears in the Marvel Comics issue War of the Realms: New Agents of Atlas #1, published on May 8, 2019. There are also two variant covers that came from a comic shop in the Philippines that feature Wave on the cover, making it her first cover appearance.
