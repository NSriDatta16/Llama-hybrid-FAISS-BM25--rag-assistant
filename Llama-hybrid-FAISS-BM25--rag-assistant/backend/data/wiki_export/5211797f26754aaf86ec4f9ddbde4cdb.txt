Opened originally in 1950, the current complex consists of three main venues: a fairs and events hall,a congress and conference centre, and the main venue the Ahoy Arena.

Background and history

Original exhibition hall
The venue has a history dating back to 1950. After the devastation of World War II, the entire city of Rotterdam needed to be rebuilt, as practically nothing was left standing. Five years after the end of the war, the works at the city and their harbor was almost finished. To celebrate the last phase, an exposition called Rotterdam Ahoy! was held. The exhibition was held in a single hall that was built for the occasion and was located where the Erasmus MC is exactly today. The temporary exhibition hall was called Ahoy'-Hal and was used for both national and international events until 1966 when local authorities decided to demolish the hall. The hall was badly damaged during the North Sea flood of 1953, when was used as shelter for the victims. After 1966, temporary accommodation was found at Hofdijk/Pompenburg in the center of Rotterdam, on the site of an abandoned airstrip.

Current Ahoy complex

The current complex began to take shape in 1968.As the Sportpaleis, originally designed as an indoor velodrome, and its three annexes were completed in 1970. The official opening of the Sportpalais took place during Six Days of Rotterdam, a six-day track cycling race, and was in the presence of the Prince Claus on 15 January 1971. However, the first fair already took place before the official opening, because in September 1970 Ahoy Halls were the location for the Femina fair. The complex's striking design won various national and international awards. The design of the venue took inspiration from the relation of the Dutch people and the water, with the building laid out like a ship.

Due the high demands,two further halls were added to the complex in 1980. The main arena was converted into a multi-use arena in 1988, when the arena's cycling track was dismantled due to disuse to in order to increase the capacity of the arena, which is still in demand for shows and other types of events. In 1998, the complex was expanded again to include a sixth event hall and a main reception hall (known as the plaza) designed by the architectural firm Benthem Crouwel.Another expansion take offices, catering facilities as well as smaller conference and meeting rooms were built.The main entrance to the Sportpaleis was also redesigned and the concrete footbridge from the Zuidplein (which was connected to a shopping centre and metro station) was demolished. Due a high number of incidents,the bridge was partly demolished to take the visiting public at the main hall more security. The demolition of the last section started on 3 March 2017, after the bridge had become unsafe due to a truck colliding with one of the bridge's girders earlier that week. In 2005, a (now removable) cycling track was built in Ahoy for the revived Six Days of Rotterdam racing event. The main arena building was comprehensively modernised between 2010 and 2011. The arena overall capacity was increased the With the works, the capacity of the arena tripled from 5 thousand people to more than 15 thousand with the instalation of new grandstands and more chairs. In addition to the new grandstands,Dutch lighting company Signify installed a new custom-made 1,000 m2 LED screen wall on the facade of the arena. Since April 2021, the complex has been equipped with 5,200 solar panels which supply large events with sustainable energy 195 days a year.

In July 2018, construction work began on an extension to the Ahoy complex. Rotterdam Ahoy Convention Centre (RACC) and RTM Stage, designed by , opened at the end of 2020 and is directly connected to the Ahoy Plaza. The new premises, featuring a dual-purpose 7.000 concert hall and 2,750-seat auditorium/theatre (expandable to 4,000), adds an additional 35,000 square metres of floor space. On the 2nd and 3rd floors there are 35 break out rooms, varying in capacity from 50 to 1,000, that can be used separately or combined and a 2,300 m2 Expo Foyer which can be used for gala dinners, expos and receptions.
