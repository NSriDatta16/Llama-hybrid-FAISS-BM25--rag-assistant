Name
The district (originally the parish) was named after the old Tveit farm (Old Norse: Þveit), since the Tveit Church was built there. The name is identical with the word þveit which means "a piece of cleared land cut from a forest".  The name spelled differently over the centuries: Tved, Thvet, and Tveid.
