The Heart of Darkness was the debut album created by Hoodlum Priest. The album was minimally successful. It featured the first and only appearance of rapper Sevier, who left the band due to creative differences. During some time after the release of The Heart of Darkness, ZTT was bought out by Warner Bros, and the album was immediately deleted by request of Warner Bros's legal department. It was later re-released on the Hoodlum Priest website on 06/06/06. A remix of "Caucasian" entitled "Scanning" appeared on the follow-up Beneath The Pavement... The Beach.
