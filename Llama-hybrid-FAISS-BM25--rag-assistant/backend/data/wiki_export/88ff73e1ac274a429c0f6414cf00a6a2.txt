Neuville-sur-Oise () is a commune in the Val-d'Oise department, in the northwest suburbs of Paris, France. It is located in the "new town" of Cergy-Pontoise, created in the 1960s.

Neuville-sur-Oise is a rather anonymous village between Jouy-le-Moutier and Cergy inside the last meander of the river Oise. Forty years after the creation of Cergy-Pontoise, the village has retained its bucolic atmosphere and there has been little construction of large scale residential developments.

In the 17th century, Charles de la Grange unites the villages of Ham (Cergy), the Sergentery of Neuville-sur-Oise and the Barony of Conflans. The Baron of Conflans, councillor to the king, Lord of Neuville and Ham built the castle of Neuville.

In 1995 was opened the university of Cergy-Neuville on the site of an old cottage near the D203, a station was also built to serve both the village and the university.

Since 1995, Neuville-sur-Oise is served by the Neuville-Université station on the RER line A line. As well as rail, Neuville is served by two bus lines; 48 and 34S linking Neuville to Cergy, Pontoise and Jouy-le-Moutier.

Le Pont de Neuville

In the early 20th century was built a suspension bridge between Neuville and Jouy-le-Moutier. This bridge replaced the ferry service between the communes.
