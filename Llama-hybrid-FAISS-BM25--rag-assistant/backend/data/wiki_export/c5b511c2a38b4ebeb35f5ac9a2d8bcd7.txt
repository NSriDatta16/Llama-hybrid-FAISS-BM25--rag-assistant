Gordon Charles Cree BMus FGMS (born 14 July 1977, Ayrshire) is a Scottish singer, actor, musician and entertainer from Darvel in Ayrshire.

Early life and education 
Gordon Cree was born and brought up in a working class home in Ayrshire, Scotland, UK.  After being educated at local primary and secondary schools, and at the unusually young age of 16, he was admitted as an undergraduate student at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow where he graduated Bachelor of Music in 1998, aged 20. Following his formal education he was mentored in piano versatility and musical direction with Peggy O'Keefe, studied orchestral scoring and arranging with Brian Fahey and organ with Professor George McPhee at Paisley Abbey.

Career 

He has earned his living exclusively from music for his whole adult life, and has performed at a very high professional level as a singer, pianist, organist, arranger, orchestrator, composer, conductor and light entertainer.

He was the musical director for many seasons at the famous Gaiety Theatre, Ayr and has been personal accompanist and musical director to several well-known artistes, most prolifically Moira Anderson and Anita Harris.  He worked for a time in the USA with legendary opera star, Marilyn Horne and has played prolifically for touring operas.

He was, for some years, a popular fixture - both alone and with his trio - at Gleneagles Hotel for Sunday lunch, special functions and during the festive season.

He has been a regular conductor for the Scottish concerts mounted by Raymond Gubbay International.

He is currently the organist and director of music of St. Andrew's West Parish Church (formerly Renfield St. Stephens), which is one of the largest and most imposing churches in Glasgow's City Centre, almost directly opposite his old stomping ground at the King's Theatre.
