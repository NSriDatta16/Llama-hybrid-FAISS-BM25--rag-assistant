Scorton is a village and civil parish in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England. It is approximately  north-west of the county town of Northallerton.

History

The village is mentioned in Domesday Book as "Scortone" in the lands of Count Alan of Brittany, who was tenant-in-chief during the Norman invasion. Before the invasion the manor was granted to Thorfin of Ravensworth but subsequently granted in 1086 to Bodin, brother of Bardulf. The manor was thereafter split into two parts, the larger granted to the Fitz Hugh family and the smaller to the Fitz Alans. The descent of the larger part of the manor followed that of the manor of Kirkby Ravensworth until 1512 when it came into the Fiennes family, who were entitled as Baron Dacre. In 1600 the manor was left to Charles Tankard and Christopher Jeynes, who had sold it to  Leonard Wastell by 1616. Towards the end of the 18th century the manor passed to the Earl of Tyrconnel and followed that family's descent.

The name is derived from a combination of the Old Norse word skor, meaning a rift in the rock, and the Old English suffix tūn, meaning farm or settlement. Put together they mean ravine farm.

Scorton was home to the now closed Scorton Grammar School, 1720–1991. Most of the buildings and grounds have been converted into houses. Scorton has a raised village green, one of only two in England. It is said that the green was built in the early 18th century by John Noble, the first headmaster of Scorton Grammar School. There was also a hospital, St John of God, built in 1880 in the grounds of the former convent of St Clare. It is now a nursing home, Abbey Care Village.

Between 1939 and 1945 the village was home to RAF Scorton, which served as a satellite of RAF Catterick. Many squadrons flew from Scorton during the Second World War including No. 56 Squadron RAF who flew Spitfires and others who flew Beaufighters. The aerodrome has now been extensively quarried away.

Scorton was once served by the Eryholme-Richmond branch line but it was closed in 1969.  The station building is now a house and much of the line between Scorton railway station and Catterick Bridge has been destroyed by quarrying.
