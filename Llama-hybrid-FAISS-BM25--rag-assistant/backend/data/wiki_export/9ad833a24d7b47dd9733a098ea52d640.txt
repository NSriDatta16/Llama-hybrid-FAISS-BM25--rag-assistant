There has been one creation of baronets with the surname Delves.

The Delves family originated in Staffordshire and the Baronets were descended from Sir John Delves, Knight of the Shire for Staffordshire and three times High Sheriff of Staffordshire, and Sir John Delves, twice High Sheriff who was killed during the Wars of the Roses at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.

The Baronetcy was created in the Baronetage of England on 8 May 1621 for Thomas Delves the great-grandson of Sir Henry Delves Kt of Dodington, Cheshire, High Sheriff of Cheshire on two occasions. The first three Baronets also served as High Sheriffs of Cheshire.

The Baronetcy became extinct on the death of the 4th Baronet. His daughter and heiress Elizabeth Delves married Sir Brian Broughton Bt in 1710.
