Tuggerah () is a large commercial hub and a suburb of the Central Coast region of New South Wales, Australia.

It is the second largest business hub, major shopping area and financial district for the Central Coast after Erina.

It is a mixture of semi-rural, residential, and light industrial. Historically it was, like much of the Wyong District, a dairy area, and still has the Pioneer Dairy Wetlands. There was an airstrip for some years which has now been built over. The Wyong South sewerage plant is also located in Tuggerah. Tuggerah is located in the Central Coast Council local government area.

History

Etymology
Not to be confused with Togara, Queensland (near Emerald), Tuggerah was originally an Aboriginal word, but its true meaning is not agreed upon by all sources. Some say that it originally meant 'cold' or 'cold place', and some say its original meaning was 'savannah grasslands'. Tuggerah was the name for the region, with The Entrance originally called "Tuggerah Entrance". "Tuggerah Beach" is located between North Entrance and Noraville. There was previously an electorate in the NSW Parliament called Tuggerah.
