Round Lake is the last part of a chain of eutrophic prairie lakes connected by the Qu'Appelle River in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The lakes — known as the Fishing Lakes — were formed by glaciation about 10,000 years ago. Round Lake Dam, an embankment dam was constructed on the east end of the lake in 1941 to control water levels and protect from floods downstream on the Qu'Appelle River.

The lake harbours recreational activities including camping, boating, and fishing. Cabins can be rented or bought along the shores of the lake. Camping is provided at Bird's Point Resort and West End. Access to the lake is provided by Highway 247. Crooked Lake Provincial Park and Crooked Lake are  west. A scenic viewpoint, located north of the lake and highway, provides a view of the lake.
