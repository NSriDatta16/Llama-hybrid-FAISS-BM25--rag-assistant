He later finished 16th and out of the points-scoring positions. He said that he was "disappointed" with the balance of the Yamaha M1 bike that season, and that his bike lacked a chassis modification to cure chatter, which the three other Yamaha riders had been riding.

AMA Superbike Championship (2007)
Ellison's contract with Tech 3 Yamaha was not renewed for following season. He then made the move across the pond and raced in AMA Superbike in the United States for the Corona Honda team in 2007.  He had a best finish of 5th at the wet Daytona circuit, in what was a difficult season in the AMA.

On 7 February, Ellison confirmed that he had agreed a contract with the Swan Honda team to ride in the 2010 championship. Ellison's season was closely documented in the film I, Superbiker.
