History
Aviation Mall opened in 1975 with JCPenney and Denby's (a regional chain) as anchors. The mall was relatively small when it first opened, but was later expanded with Sears and then Caldor. In 1994, JCPenney built a new store next to its original store, with mall management reconstructing the former space to feature more small store space. TJ Maxx was added the same year replacing space previously occupied by Magrams. In 1998, Caldor shuttered and was converted to The Bon-Ton. Target built on in 2004, and Dick's Sporting Goods moved into remaining space of the original JCPenney in 2005.

In 2017, Regal Cinemas opened after expanding from seven screens to nine and was upgraded to feature new flooring and wall coverings along with reclining seats.
 
The dawn of the 2020s saw several storied traditional department store retailers update its brick-and-mortar formats after being encroached upon to a degree by several digital retailers in recent years.

On April 17, 2018 it was announced department store retailer The Bon-Ton would be shuttering after it wasn't able to establish any new conditions to satisfy its established long-term debt. On March 4, 2019, it was announced that the previous The Bon-Ton outpost would become an Ollie's Bargain Outlet which was set to open August 28, 2019.

On August 22, 2018, it was announced that Sears would shutter as part of an ongoing decision to phase out of brick-and-mortar. Potential replacement tenants have been rumored in discussion since 2019.
