Name
The village of Vigeland was named for the historic Vigeland farm which was located where the village is now. The farm was first documented in 1390 (Vikinggaland, meaning "Viking land"). The first element is the genitive case of the Old Norse personal name  meaning  "land owned by (the man) Víkingi". The first element could also be the genitive plural case of the Old Norse word víkingr meaning "Viking"  but the use of such a name would be a bit obscure.
