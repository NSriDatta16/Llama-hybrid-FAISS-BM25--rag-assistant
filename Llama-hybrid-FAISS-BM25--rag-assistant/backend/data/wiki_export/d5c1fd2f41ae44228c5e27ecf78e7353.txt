History

1975–1989: KB
The station first aired in 1975 as KB 89.1 under the call letters DWKB-FM. It was under the ownership of the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. In a short time, it became one of the country's most listened to easy listening FM stations.

1989–2001: 89 DMZ
The station later rebranded as 89 DMZ (it also changed its callsign to DZMZ-FM), which played dance, hip hop and remixed music. The late rapper, Francis Magalona, worked with the station through his program, "The Word-up Show", which aired on Saturday nights. It also became the home of the "Mobile Circuit" aired on Friday nights.

2001–present: Wave
In 2001, IBC and Blockbuster Broadcasting System went into a government-sponsored bidding and the Vera Group, through Blockbuster Broadcasting System, won the rights to the frequency and the facilities (callsign then changed to DWAV). However, the network still shares its transmission facilities of IBC 13 until 2014 when it began transmitting from Antipolo.

Wave 89.1 began regular operations shortly on March 1, 2001. Managed by former Magic 89.9 jock Rolando Sulit a.k.a. Joe D'Mango, the station began its operations with an urban AC format. Some months later, its programming gradually shifted to full pop/R&B.

In 2007, Gary Caoili took over the management of the station after Sulit departed his management duties for both Wave and sister station Jam 88.3 (and subsequently transferred to ABS-CBN before migrating to Australia for good). A year later, after the demise of Blazin' 105.9, the station shifted to Urban Contemporary, playing more Hip Hop and R&B.

From 2010 to 2014, the station has been known for hosting the Urban Music Awards.

From 2015 to mid-2022, former Magic and Max FM station manager Nelson Capulso ("Sgt. Pepper"/"The Sarge") has been the station manager of Wave 89.1.
