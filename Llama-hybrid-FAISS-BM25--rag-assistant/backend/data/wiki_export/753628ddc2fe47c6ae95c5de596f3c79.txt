Nathaniel Hill (1861â€“1934) was an Irish impressionist painter.

Life
Hill was born in Drogheda, Ireland. From 1877 to 1880 he studied at the Metropolitan School of Art in Dublin, where he was a contemporary of Roderic O'Conor, Walter Osborne, and Joseph Malachy Kavanagh. During the 1880s he made visits to Brittany in the company of Osborne and O'Conor. He painted rural scenes, as well as peasants and country imagery. A fine example of his portrait style  - Hill's late 19th Century portrait of the brewer and banker Thomas Plunkett Cairnes - is held at the Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. This work is one of his portraits of prominent Drogheda citizens of that period.

Hill died at Betws-y-Coed, North Wales, in 1930.
