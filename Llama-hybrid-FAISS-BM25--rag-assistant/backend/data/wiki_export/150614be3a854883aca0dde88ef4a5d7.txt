Nubuck (pronounced ) is top-grain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side, or outside, to give a slight nap of short protein fibers, producing a velvet-like surface. It is resistant to wear, and may be white or coloured.

Nubuck is similar to suede, but is created from the outer side of a hide, giving it more strength and thickness and a fine grain. It is generally more expensive than suede, and must be coloured or dyed heavily to cover up the sanding and stamping process.

Nubuck characteristics are similar to aniline leather. It is soft to the touch, scratches easily, and water drops darken it temporarily (it dries to its original color). Shoes and auto interiors are some of the most common commercial uses for this leather.

Originating from the leather tanning traditions of yore, Nubuck leather gets its name from "new" and buck(skin)., a nod to the young deer hides initially used for its production. Over time, the term has expanded to include similar materials made from other types of hide, typically cowhide or calfskin. This top-grain leather is valued for its velvety surface, achieved through sanding or buffing, which distinguishes it from other types of leather in texture and appearance.
