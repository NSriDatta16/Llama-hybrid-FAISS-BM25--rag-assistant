The Colorado River, or the Rio Colorado (), in Costa Rica is a distributary of the San Juan River which flows  towards the Caribbean in the northern parts of Heredia and Lim√≥n Provinces. The surrounding habitats are protected as part of the second largest rain forest preserve in the country, the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge.

The river is a well known tourist destination, particularly for fishing for tarpon and snook. The Colorado River is considered one of the best places in the world to catch Atlantic tarpon.
