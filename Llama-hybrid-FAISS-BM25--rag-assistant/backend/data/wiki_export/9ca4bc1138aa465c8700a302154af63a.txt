Playing career
Schmitz was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 14th round of the 1961 NFL Draft.

During his career he recorded three interceptions for 65 yards and a touchdown.  Also, he recorded one safety from the linebacker spot.  Perhaps his most memorable moment came at Pitt Stadium on November 10, 1963, where he recorded his only safety.  Schmitz tackled Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown of the Cleveland Browns in the end zone for a safety that gave the Steelers a 9–7 victory.

His last season in the NFL came in 1966; a season in which he split time between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings.

He joined the Pittsburgh Steelers as an area scout in 1976 after being hired by Art Rooney, Jr.  Schmitz worked for the Steelers until 1995.
