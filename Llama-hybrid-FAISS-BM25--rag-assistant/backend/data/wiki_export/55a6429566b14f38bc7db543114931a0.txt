Plot

Gameplay
Gameplay takes place in three sections. First, a territory to attack is selected from the campaign screen; next the player is taken to the territory, where he battles through hordes of themed aggressors on a side-scrolling landscape to reach a castle, which he must also conquer; finally the player faces the master of the castle – a wizard with four spell-casting tentacle arms – whom he must defeat by firing magic at him whilst avoiding the spells that the wizard fires back. On defeating the master of the castle the player wins the territory and returns to the campaign screen to select the next territory to attack.

Reception
Onslaught received mixed reviews on its release. Whilst The Games Machine gave it a score of 95% and rated it a "Top Game" and Zzap! scored it 85%, Your Amiga gave it 54%, and Sweden's Datormagazin awarded it just 3/10. Mega placed the game at #8 in their list of the 10 Worst Mega Drive Games of All Time.
