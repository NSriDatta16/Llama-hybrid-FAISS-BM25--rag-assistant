Killeter () is a small village and townland near Castlederg in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 147.

Killeter has a yearly August fair, which celebrates the diversity and richness of rural life. The village itself sits along an ancient pilgrimage trail which winds its way to Lough Derg. The national cycle network traverses part of this trail, which is bounded to the west by Killeter Forest.

The writer Benedict Kiely has stated that he based the fictional village of Carmincross, in his novel Nothing Happens in Carmincross, on Killeter.

History
Killeter, plus the rural protrusion of Tyrone to its immediate west, would have been transferred to the Irish Free State had the recommendations of the Irish Boundary Commission been enacted in 1925.
