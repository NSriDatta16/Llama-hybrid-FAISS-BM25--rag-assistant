The high commissioner of the United Kingdom to Belize is the United Kingdom's foremost diplomatic representative in Belize, and head of the UK's diplomatic mission in Belize.

As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Belize are at governmental level, rather than between heads of state.  Thus, the countries exchange high commissioners rather than ambassadors.
