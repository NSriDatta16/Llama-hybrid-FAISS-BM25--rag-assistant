In February 1992, he was appointed on the nomination of Taoiseach Albert Reynolds as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, serving until January 1993. In July 1997, he was appointed on the nomination of Taoiseach Bertie Ahern as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, serving until June 2002.

In the 29th Dáil, Wallace was Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee until November 2004.
