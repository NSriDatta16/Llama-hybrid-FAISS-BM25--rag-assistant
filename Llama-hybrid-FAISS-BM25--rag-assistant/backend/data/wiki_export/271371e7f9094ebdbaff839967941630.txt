Bobsleigh
In 2005–2006, her rookie bobsleigh season, Moyse and her partner Helen Upperton won the Canadian Championships and earned four medals on the World Cup circuit including a gold at an event in St. Moritz, Switzerland. Heather also set push start records on five international tracks. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Moyse and Upperton finished in fourth place in the two-man bobsleigh event, missing bronze by five one-hundredths of a second behind the host Italian team. The pair set the push start record for the Olympic track with a 5.16-second start time in their first heat.

After a one-year absence due to educational commitments, Moyse returned to the World Cup circuit in 2007–2008 as one of two brakeman for Canada 1 pilot Helen Upperton. In four races the duo earned a silver, bronze and two 5th-place finishes. At the 2008 World Championships in Altenberg, Germany, Moyse raced with Canada 3 pilot Lisa Szabon and the pair finished in 11th place.

During the 2008–2009 World Cup season, Moyse returned from a serious shoulder injury (incurred while playing rugby for Canada). In her only race with Canada 1 pilot Upperton the duo won gold in Igls, Austria. Moyse and Canada 2 pilot Kaillie Humphries recorded a 5th in St. Moritz, silver in Whistler and 5th at the 2009 World Championships in Lake Placid, New York. In four other races, Moyse did not race with any of Canada's three sleds.

During the 2009–2010 World Cup season, Moyse & Humphries finished second overall behind only Sandra Kiriasis and won four medals including gold in Altenberg, Germany. They set or tied the track start record in every race in which they competed together.

She won a gold medal in the Two-woman competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics with Kaillie Humphries. The silver medal was won by fellow Canadians Shelley-Ann Brown and Helen Upperton. It marked the first time at the 2010 Olympics that Canadians had won two medals in one event. For winning the Gold Medal, Moyse was on the cover of Hello! Canada in March 2010. Moyse joins former University of Toronto student-athlete Jayna Hefford as the only University of Toronto graduates to claim a gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games.

Moyse missed the first half of the 2010–11 World Cup bobsleigh season due to an ankle injury suffered in the final game of the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup.

Moyse returned to the Canadian Bobsleigh Team in the fall of 2013, earning a spot as the top brakeman on the 2014 Canadian Olympic team. Heather and Kaillie Humphries repeated as Olympic gold medallists at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, pulling ahead of rival USA 1, piloted by Elana Meyers and braked by Lauryn Williams, on the final run of the four-heat competition. The pair became only the third Canadian Winter Olympians to repeat as gold medalists in a non-team sport and the only female gold medalists from the Vancouver Olympics to repeat as gold medalists in Sochi. Humphries and Moyse were also selected by the Canadian Olympic Committee as Canada's flagbearers in the closing ceremonies.

Moyse retired from bobsleigh after the 2014 Olympics, however a couple of months before the start of the 2017–18 season she decided to return to the sport after push athlete-turned-pilot Alysia Rissling contacted her about it in August 2017, having turned down the opportunity to return to competition with Humphries the previous year. With Rissling as driver, the pair finished 6th in the two-woman bobsleigh event representing Canada at the 2018 Winter Olympics.
