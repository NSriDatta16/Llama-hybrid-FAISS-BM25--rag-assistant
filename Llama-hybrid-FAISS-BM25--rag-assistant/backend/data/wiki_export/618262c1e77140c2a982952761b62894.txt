The club was formed in 1896 as a Junior club, by Dr. E.S.S. Davis, a member of the Cornwall County Football Association. St Blazey won the Eastern Divisional Cup, Junior Cup, and Bodmin & District League Cup in 1909 and 1910 before it attained Senior status later that year. The club reached the final of the Cornwall Senior Cup twice in the early 1930s, finishing as runners-up on both occasions before winning the competition for the first time in 1936, along with the Cornwall Charity Cup, and Herald Cup to become the first club to win all three trophies in one season. St Blazey were a founder member of the South Western League in 1951, a league which they won thirteen times, including the 2001–02 season when they suffered no league defeats en route to winning the trophy. The club achieved thirty-three victories, and three draws from thirty-six league matches that season, earning 102 points.

Stadium

The club play their home games at Blaise Park, Station Road, St Blazey, Cornwall. PL24 2ND

Blaise Park is a 3,500 capacity stadium which opened in 1906. The ground was built on reclaimed land from the nearby estuary in the town. It was well used during the First World War as the pitch was dug up and the underlying sand was used to fill sandbags. The club moved back in after the war and constructed a wooden grandstand with bench seating in 1931, painted in the club's colours. A crowd of more than 6,500 were in attendance for a Cornwall Senior Cup match against St Austell in 1949. In common with many non-league grounds, there is a sizeable grass bank which runs the length of the opposite touchline, with the River Par and Atlantic Coast Railway directly behind it.

The old grandstand was demolished at the turn of the twenty-first century and replaced by a concrete and metal structure which has a seating capacity of approximately 200. The only other cover at the ground is provided by a breezeblock and timber lean-to behind the near goal. Directly next to that is the large clubhouse, built in 1972, which leads out onto the car park. Blaise Park was the first sports ground in Cornwall to install floodlights in the late 1950s. They were paid for through a scheme of £1 shares and erected by voluntary labour. They were replaced in November 1989 and inaugurated with a friendly match against Football League club Plymouth Argyle. The stadium is joined to Station Road, which in turn feeds onto the A390, one of the major roads in the county. The nearest train station is Par, approximately two miles away, which provides direct transport to Truro, Plymouth, and London.

Statistics and records

The club has entered all but one edition of the FA Cup since 1950, and the FA Vase since 1984. They also competed in the FA Trophy during the 1970s. The club held a notable record following their unbeaten South Western League season in 2002.
