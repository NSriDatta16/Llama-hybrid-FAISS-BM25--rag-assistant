Vinyl 

The double vinyl LP has a slightly different track listing as it opens with the then forthcoming singles "True Skool" and "Walk a Mile in My Shoes" with all other tracks appearing in the same order as the CD. While such changes are sometimes made to vinyl versions to ensure sides are of a similar length, this is not the case as the only two tracks that would have been on different sides (i.e. "Just for the Kick" should be on side one and "Walk a Mile in My Shoes" should be on side two) are almost identical in length (both just over five minutes long).

Side one
"True Skool" (feat. Roots Manuva)
"Walk a Mile in My Shoes" (feat. Robert Owens)
"Man in a Garage" (feat. John Matthias)

Side two
"Just for the Kick" (feat. Annette Peacock)
"Mr Nichols" (feat. Saul Williams)
"A Whistle and a Prayer" (feat. Fog)

Side three
"Everything is Under Control" (feat. Mike Ladd & Jon Spencer)
"Boogieman" (feat. Amiri Baraka)
"Aid Dealer" (feat. Soweto Kinch)

Side four
"This Island Earth" (feat. Mpho Skeef)
