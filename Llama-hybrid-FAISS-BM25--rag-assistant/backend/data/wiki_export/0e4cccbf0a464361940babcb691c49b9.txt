Star FM was an Australian radio network, consisting of Top 40/CHR formatted stations in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The brand was created by DMG Regional Radio in 1999, with the network being sold to Southern Cross Austereo.

Programming
The network's stations are aimed at the under-35 section of the market, playing Top 40 and popular music. For most stations, the only local program heard on these stations is the breakfast programme, with Alo Baker's Workday networked from the Gold Coast Media Centre, and drive/nights programming coming from Southern Cross Austereo's metropolitan stations Fox FM in Melbourne and 2Day FM in Sydney.

In 2007, Star FM changed its major positioning statement from "Todays Best Music" to "Your HIT Music Station". The positioning statement was changed again in June 2011 to "Your #1 HIT Music Station" and following the Southern Cross Media/Austereo merger and became "Fresh & First" in 2013 until recently it was changed again to "Hits & Old Skool"

On 15 December 2016, all stations that are a part of the Hit Network were rebranded as Hit, meaning that the Star FM and Hot FM brandings ceased to exist.
