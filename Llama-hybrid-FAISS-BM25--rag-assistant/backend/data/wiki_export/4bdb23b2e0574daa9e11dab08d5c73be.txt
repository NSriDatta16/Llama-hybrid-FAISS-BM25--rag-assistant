Melbost () is a traditionally Gaelic-speaking village in Point on the east coast of the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland's north-west. It is largely a crofting township and is about  east of Stornoway at the head of an isthmus connecting with the Eye Peninsula. Melbost is technically in the district of Point; however, it is not located on the Eye Peninsula itself. The RAF Stornoway war memorial is located in the village.

Culture 
The Gaelic poet Murdo Macfarlane () known as 'Bàrd Mhealaboist' (the Melbost Bard) was a published poet and campaigner for Scottish Gaelic who was born and brought up in Melbost. He is famous for the song Cànan nan Gàidheal.
