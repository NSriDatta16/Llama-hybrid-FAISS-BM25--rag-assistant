History
IL 97 is the site of a pioneering work of highway beautification, the planting in 1934 of what was once a line of 'red haw' hawthorns and other Illinois native trees along the tourist route from west of Springfield to New Salem.  The work, done by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Illinois Federation of Garden Clubs, is commemorated by a marker installation at Tallula Junction, the southern intersection of Illinois Route 97 and Illinois Route 123.
