IFAF Europe is the governing body of American football in Europe. It is a member of the International Federation of American Football. IFAF Europe replaced the European Federation of American Football (EFAF) which had begun in 1976 as the American European Football Federation (AEFF).

IFAF Europe now organises two competitions: the European Championship for male national teams and the European Junior Championship for 16- to 19-year-olds.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Italian Federation of American Football (FIDAP; Federazione Italiana Di American Football) announced that the Italy national team, the then-IFAF Europe title holders, refused to play against Russia in October 2022 in a qualifier for the 2023 IFAF European Championships.
