The team ended the season as runners-up and Giménez with 21 goals became league top goalscorer. Lugano played in the 2001–02 Champions League second qualifying round, but Giménez refused to play, thus forcing a transfer.

He joined Basel's first team during their 2001–02 season under head coach Christian Gross. Giménez made his team debut on 18 July 2001 in the 3–3 away draw with St. Gallen.
