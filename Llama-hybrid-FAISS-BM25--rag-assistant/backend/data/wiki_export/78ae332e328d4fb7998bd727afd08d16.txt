Open the Door is the third studio album by English musician Roger Hodgson. It was his first since 1987's Hai Hai, and was released on 9 May 2000 on Epic Records.

Overview
Open the Door was recorded mostly in France and features mostly French musicians, many who have played on Excalibur (La Légende Des Celtes) also produced by Simon featuring contributions from Hodgson, as his backup band. This is Hodgson's only solo album to be partially recorded outside the United States.

Once again collaborating with Hodgson, former Yes guitarist and vocalist Trevor Rabin contributed electric guitar, keyboards and background vocals on "The More I Look". The song "Showdown" was performed live by Hodgson already in 1996 and a live version was released on his latest album Rites Of Passage. "Death and a Zoo" and "Say Goodbye" were performed live by Hodgson already in 1998.

Reception

Allmusic gave the album a positive review, calling it "the closest thing to Supertramp since ...Famous Last Words..." and praising the songwriting, particularly the unusual incorporation of French influences.
