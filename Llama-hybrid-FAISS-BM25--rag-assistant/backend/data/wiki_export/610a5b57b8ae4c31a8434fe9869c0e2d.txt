The Batura Muztagh () mountains are a sub-range of the Karakoram mountain range. They are located in Passu (Gojal Valley) in the Hunza District of Gilgit-Baltistan province in northern Pakistan.

They are the westernmost sub-range of the Karakoram, running from Chalt village in Bar Valley in the east to Kampir Dior in the Kurumbar Valley in the west, and they separate the Hindu Raj range from the Karakoram range. The Muchu Chhish peak located in this sub-range remains the second highest unclimbed peak in the world.
