Juan Menéndez Pidal (1858, in Madrid – 1915) was a Spanish archivist, jurisconsult, historian, and poet, brother of Luis and Ramón Menéndez Pidal.  He was long a director of the Archivo Histórico Nacional at Madrid, and a director of the Revista de Archivos, Bibliotecas, y Museos.

Born in Madrid, he studied law until he obtained his title, and then devoted himself to journalism. His Dios y César, an ecclesiastical and legal study of the relation of church and state, attracted much attention.  In 1914 he was elected a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of the Language.
