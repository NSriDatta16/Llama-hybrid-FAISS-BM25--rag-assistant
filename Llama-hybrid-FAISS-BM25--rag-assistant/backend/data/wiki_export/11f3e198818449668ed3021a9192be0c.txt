Seedings
The draw took place on 2 February 1990. Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the competition, and 34 teams entered the draw, with the Faroe Islands and San Marino participating in a European qualifying tournament for the first time.

Following German reunification on 3 October 1990, East Germany were withdrawn since the country ceased to exist: the newly unified German team took over the fixtures of West Germany, while those of East Germany were scratched.

The qualifiers thus consisted of 33 teams divided into seven groups (two of four teams and five of five teams) were played in 1990 and 1991. Each group winner progressed to the finals. This was the last European Championship qualifying phase which awarded two points for a win; from 1996 onward, teams earned 3 points for a win.
