The Sydney College of Divinity (SCD) is a consortium of Christian theological educational institutions and Bible colleges based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The college is structured as a federation of member institutions, each of which retains its autonomy and respective theological traditions. Member institutions represent a range of Christian churches.

SCD is a registered Higher Education Provider, with degrees and awards accredited by the Australian Government Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, a regulatory and quality agency for higher education. The consortium offers undergraduate awards that meet Australian and Korean education standards, postgraduate qualifications by coursework and research that meet Australian standards, and postgraduate qualifications by coursework that meet Korean standards. Awards range from Diploma in Theology to Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).

In Australia, seminaries which deliver instruction and prepare people for religious ordination are sometimes separate from theological educational institutions.
