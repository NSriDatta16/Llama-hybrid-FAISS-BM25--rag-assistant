The Bnei Shimon Regional Council (, Mo'atza Azorit Bnei Shim'on, lit. Regional Council 'Sons of Shimon'), is a regional council in the northern Negev in the south of Israel. Most of its territory lies north of Beersheba and the rest bounds Beersheba on the west and east sides as well. The eastern border of this territory straddles the Green Line. It is named after the tribe of Shimon which had been allotted this region according to the Book of Joshua (19:1-9).

There are 13 communities, including seven kibbutzim, four moshavim, and two new rural towns. Four of the communities (three kibbutzim and one moshav) were established in the founding of the '11 points in the Negev' in 1946. The rest of the kibbutzim and moshavim were set up after the establishment of the State of Israel.
