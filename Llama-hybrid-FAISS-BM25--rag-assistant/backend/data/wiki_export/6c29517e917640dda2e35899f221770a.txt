The Twenty-Seven Points: Live 92â€“95 is a double album by the Fall, released in 1995. The album consists of live recordings made in various locations between 1991 and 1995, but also contains interludes and two previously unheard studio tracks. Credits on the album are sketchy but the front cover lists the cities in which the tracks were recorded; Prague, Tel Aviv, London, Glasgow, New York City and Manchester.

Critical reception
Trouser Press wrote: "Composed of live tracks, rough demos and random interpolations from Glasgow, London, Manchester, New York, Prague and Tel Aviv, the 28-track, two-CD set is frustratingly uneven but ultimately captures the Fall live experience, complete with onstage disasters."

Track listing
Titles are given exactly as listed on the original sleeve.

Disc one

Note
Tracks 10 and 11 are listed on the cover as one track but indexed as 2 on the actual disc.

Disc two

Note
Tracks 15 and 16 are listed as one track but indexed as two on the disc.

2006 reissue 
The album was reissued by Castle Music in May 2006 in a remastered edition but with no additional material. However, as the release was mastered from the original vinyl, the original CD-only bonus tracks "Three Points" and "Up Too Much" are missing from this new version, despite being listed on the sleeve.
