Music video

Synopsis 
The video follows Ciara as she goes clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, reflective apartment, as she is dressed in black and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, the windows of the building brighten and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a strobe effect. White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux high-speed strobe lights are synchronized to the rain to make it appear as though many of the droplets are suspended in time.

The video ends with the camera pulling out of the sequence, with the flashing lights on the cityscape making up the flashing lights of Ciara's alarm clock from the beginning of the video. Henry Adaso of About.com gave the video three and a half out of five stars, stating that even though the song was a summer hit, when up against the recently released "Déjà Vu" video, Adaso said, "While Ciara gives Beyoncé a run for her money, the dance moves are unoriginal."

Live performances 
The singer performed the song on several occasions. She performed the song on the second season finale of So You Think You Can Dance. She later appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to perform the song on December 5, 2006, as well as the 2006 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the 2006 St. Lucia Jazz Festival, and MTV Goes Gold: New Year's Eve 2007.
