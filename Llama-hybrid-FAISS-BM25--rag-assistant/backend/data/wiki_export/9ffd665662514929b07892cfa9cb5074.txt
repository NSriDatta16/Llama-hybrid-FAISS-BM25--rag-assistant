Geography 

Booran is a neighbourhood with the suburb (). It was the site of the historic town of Booran, which was bounded by the (then) South Coast railway line (now the Gold Coast railway line) to the west, Victoria Street to the north, North Street to the east and Bruce Street to the south.

History
In 1888, a town of Booran was surveyed following the construction of the South Coast railway line. The name Booran comes from the Yugarabul language group word 'buran' (or 'booran') meaning 'wind' (or 'wind from the south').  On 7 March 1889 the Queensland Government auctioned 30 building allotments in the new town. There were more land sales in Booran in December 1889.

The name Woodridge is derived from an informal name given to a property owned by Octavius Stubbs. When the Queensland Railways Department opened a platform to the public in early 1917 they selected Woodridge for the station name and later that year the name was recognised by the post office.
