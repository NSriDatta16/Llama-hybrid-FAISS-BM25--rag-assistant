The Newarkâ€“Elizabeth Rail Link (NERL) is a New Jersey Transit proposed -long light rail line in New Jersey, which would connect the downtown areas of Newark and Elizabeth with Newark Liberty International Airport. The construction of the project was being planned in stages, or "minimum operable segments" (MOS).

The first minimum operable segment (MOS-1) opened to the public on July 17, 2006, as the Newark Light Rail Broad Street Line, connecting Broad Street Station and Penn Station in Newark.

The second segment (MOS-2) would have connected Penn Station with the airport, while the third segment became known as the Union County Light Rail.

New Jersey Transit cited the project in its 2016  Capital Improvement Program without any specific allocation.
