Jericho Lands 
West Point Grey is home to the Jericho Lands, composed of two parcels of land with a total area of . In a historic agreement in 2014, the larger eastern parcel was acquired by a joint ownership group composed of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations and Canada Lands Company. In 2016, the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations partnership acquired the smaller western parcel from the provincial government. The entire area is slated for redevelopment and initial public engagement began in March 2019 in conjunction with the City of Vancouver.

To the west, the Jericho Hill Grounds is a  property formerly owned by the provincial government and houses the West Point Grey Academy private school. The eastern  parcel is termed the "Jericho Garrison property" and was previously owned by the Department of Defence. It housed various military branches throughout the 20th century. The 39 Canadian Brigade Group, headquarters for all the Canadian Forces' Army Primary Reserve units in British Columbia, previously had its headquarters in the northeastern section of the neighbourhood, which is home to Vancouver's largest youth hostel.

According to ancient First Nations legend, Point Grey is the "Battleground of the West Wind". The rock representing the god of the West Wind, which is sitting off the point, is called Homolsom. As the rock is sitting between their two territories, Homolsom is half a Squamish word and half a Fraser River language word.

Festivals 
Fiesta Days, a family oriented carnival, is held along 10th Avenue and at Trimble Park in June, with rides, games, performances and a parade.
