History
Nobiru Station opened on April 10, 1928 as a station on the Miyagi Electric Railway. On October 23, 1931, it was renamed . The Miyagi Electric Railway was nationalized on May 1, 1944, and the station name reverted to its present name. The station was absorbed into the JR East network upon the privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987.

The station was closed from March 11, 2011, due to damage to the line associated with the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and services were replaced by provisional bus services. The station reopened on May 30, 2015, on a higher ground where the former community around the station would be reconstructed. Due to the relocation, the distance from Aoba-Dōri was changed from 34.0 kilometers to 33.4 kilometers.
