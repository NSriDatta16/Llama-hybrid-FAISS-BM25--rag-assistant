12 Gardens Live is the fourth live album by American singer/songwriter Billy Joel, recorded during a former record run of 12 sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City in early 2006. It was released on June 13, 2006.

Although some of the singer's best known hits are on the album, several are transposed into a lower key to accommodate Joel's maturing vocal range. This is also the first time Joel's signature song "Piano Man" has appeared on a live CD.
