Various episodes during this season went unaired on the main Nickelodeon network, instead making their worldwide debut on the Canadian children's channel, YTV. As such, each date is listed in two separate columns.

Scrapped episodes
Various episodes from the series ended up being scrapped. "A Tail of Two Rangers" / "Bye Bye Beavers" was never animated due to the latter breaking Nickelodeon's rule against "final episodes" that reference the fact that the show is ending. In around 2001, an archived version YTV's website confirmed this episode, alongside two others (#064 - "Sister Pilot" and #065 - "The Angry Beavers Rock Opera," two half-hour specials). Don Del Grande's episode guide denotes two other scrapped shows: another Halloween special, "The Very Loud Screams of the Night Beast" and a stand-alone segment entitled "Tree Troubles." (mistakenly listed as "Tree Flockers.") The latter's script cover can be found on an archived version of Micah Wright's website.
