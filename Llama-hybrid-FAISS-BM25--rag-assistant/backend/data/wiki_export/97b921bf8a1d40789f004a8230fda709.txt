Rabbi Mayer Schiller (born June 1951) is an American chasid based in Monsey, New York, who identifies himself as a member of Skver and Rachmastrivka groups, and is a spokesperson for the Skver community in New Square. Schiller also maintains active ties to the Modern Orthodox community. He taught at Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy of Yeshiva University,  He is a baal teshuva, having begun practicing Orthodoxy in the spring of 1964 at age 12.

He is a nationalist who criticizes liberal notions of race and the bias against traditional religion in today's media and popular culture. He has been associated with various groups, including the Third Way (UK) and the Ulster Third Way. However, Schiller has also advocated a universalist morality and embrace of the Other, provided that is pursued without loss to group identity. He is involved with the group Toward Tradition, which seeks to advance co-operation between Orthodox Jews and conservative Christians, for example, on issues like abortion, marriage, family, religious schools, and religious freedom.

Schiller is also the author of two books - The Road Back: A Discovery of Judaism Without Embellishments, The (Guilty) Conscience of a Conservative (under the name Craig Schiller) -and a monograph in defense of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch's Torah Im Derech Eretz philosophy, titled "And They Shall Judge the People With True Righteousness". He is an English teacher at Mesivta Beth Shraga.
