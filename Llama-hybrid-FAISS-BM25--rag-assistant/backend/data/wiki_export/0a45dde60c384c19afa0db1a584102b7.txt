100 Greatest is a long-running TV strand on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom that has been broadcasting from 11 September 1999 to 10 October 2015, originating in Tyne Tees Televisionâ€™s Factual Features department under Executive Producer Mark Robinson. The "list show" programmes are generally public polls, and reflect the votes of visitors to the Channel 4 website. However, the results of some of the polls are determined by experts. The programmes are usually broadcast in the weekend schedule, in three- or four-hour blocks, throughout the year. Although the strand has never been officially retired, there have been no new editions since 2015. They are also repeated on E4 on Saturday nights or on Sunday nights.
