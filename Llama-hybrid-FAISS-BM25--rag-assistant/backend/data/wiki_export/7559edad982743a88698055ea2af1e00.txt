Jalan Bukit Fraser 1 or Jalan Gap-Bukit Fraser, Federal Route 56, is a federal road in Fraser's Hill, both in Selangor and Pahang state, Malaysia. Unlike most federal roads in Malaysia, Jalan Bukit Fraser is a single-lane federal road, which direction was used to be reversed hourly before the newer Jalan Bukit Fraser 2 route 148 was completed in 2001 for downhill traffic. Now the road is used for uphill traffic at all times. The road is only open during daytime for safety reasons. It is maintained by the Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) and the Fraser's Hill Development Corporation (FHDC).
