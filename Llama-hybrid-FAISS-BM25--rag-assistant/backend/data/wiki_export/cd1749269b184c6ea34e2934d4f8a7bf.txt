In 1944, he became the conductor of YLE's Radio Orchestra, and was elevated to Chief Conductor in 1950.  He served in the post until his death in 1961.

Fougstedt taught music theory and choral conducting at the Sibelius Academy.  He also was a member of the Swedish Royal Music Academy and received the honorary title of Professor in 1960.  His compositions included Angoscia (1954), the first Finnish dodecaphonic orchestral work, Trittico sinfonico (1958), and Aurea dicta (1959).
