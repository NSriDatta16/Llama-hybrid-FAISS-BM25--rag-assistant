Vegetable oils are triglycerides extracted from plants. Some of these oils have been part of human culture for millennia. Edible vegetable oils are used in food, both in cooking and as supplements. Many oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, such as in oil lamps and as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some of the many other uses include wood finishing, oil painting, and skin care.

Definition 
The term "vegetable oil" can be narrowly defined as referring only to substances that are liquid at room temperature, or broadly defined without regard to a substance's state (liquid or solid) at a given temperature. While a large majority of the entries in this list fit the narrower of these definitions, some do not qualify as vegetable oils according to all understandings of the term.

Classification 
Vegetable oils can be classified in several ways. For instance, by their use or by the method used to extract them. In this article, vegetable oils are grouped in common classes of use.

Extraction method 
There are several types of plant oils, distinguished by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may be separated from the plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid–liquid extraction.

Sources and Uses
Most, but not all vegetable oils are extracted from the fruits or seeds of plants. For instance, palm oil is extracted from palm fruits, while soybean oil is extracted from soybean seeds.
Vegetable oils may also be classified by grouping oils extracted from similar plants, such as "nut oils".

Although most plants contain some oil, only the oil from certain major oil crops complemented by a few dozen minor oil crops is widely used and traded.

Use 
Oils from plants are used for several different purposes. Edible vegetable oils may be used for cooking, or as food additives. Many vegetable oils, edible and otherwise, are burned as fuel, for instance as a substitute for petroleum-based fuels. Some may be also used for cosmetics, medical purposes, wood finishing, oil painting and other industrial purposes.

Edible oils

Major oils
These oils make up a significant fraction of worldwide edible oil production. All are also used as fuel oils.

 Coconut oil, a cooking oil, with medical and industrial applications as well. Extracted from the kernel or meat of the fruit of the coconut palm. Common in the tropics, and unusual in composition, with medium chain fatty acids dominant.
 Corn oil, one of the principal oils sold as salad and cooking oil.
Cottonseed oil, used as a salad and cooking oil, both domestically and industrially.
 Olive oil, used in cooking, cosmetics, soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps.
 Palm oil, the most widely produced tropical oil. Popular in West African and Brazilian cuisine. Also used to make biofuel.
 Peanut oil (Ground nut oil), a clear oil with some applications as a salad dressing, and, due to its high smoke point, especially used for frying.
 Rapeseed oil, including Canola oil, the most sold cooking oil all around the world; used as a salad and cooking oil, both domestically and industrially. Also used in fuel industry as bio-fuel.
 Safflower oil, until the 1960s used in the paint industry, now mostly as a cooking oil.
 Sesame oil, cold pressed as light cooking oil, hot pressed for a darker and stronger flavor.
 Soybean oil, produced as a byproduct of processing soy meal.
 Sunflower oil, a common cooking oil, also used to make biodiesel.

Nut oils

Nut oils are generally used in cooking, for their flavor. Most are quite costly, because of the difficulty of extracting the oil.

 Almond oil, used as an edible oil, but primarily in the manufacture of cosmetics.
 Beech nut oil, from Fagus sylvatica nuts, is a well-regarded edible oil in Europe, used for salads and cooking.
 Brazil nut oil contains 75% unsaturated fatty acids composed mainly of oleic and linolenic acids, as well as the phytosterol, beta-sitosterol, and fat-soluble vitamin E.  Extra virgin oil can be obtained during the first pressing of the nuts, possibly for use as a substitute for olive oil due to its mild, pleasant flavor. 
 Cashew oil, somewhat comparable to olive oil. May have value for fighting dental cavities.
 Jamaican cobnut oil, a sweet, fine-flavored oil pressed from the seeds of Omphalea triandra in the tropical Americas. It is also reported to be used as a lubricant.

 Pistachio oil, a strongly flavored oil with a distinctive green color.
 Walnut oil, used for its flavor, also used by Renaissance painters in oil paints.
 Pumpkin seed oil

Citrus oils
A number of citrus plants yield pressed oils. Some, such as lemon and orange oil, are used as essential oils, which is uncommon for pressed oils.<ref
 group="note">Lime oil, for example, is distilled, not pressed. See Jackson, p. 131</ref> The seeds of many if not most members of the citrus family yield usable oils.

Oils from melon and gourd seeds

Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds from these plants are noted for their oil content, but little information is available on methods of extracting the oil. In most cases, the plants are grown as food, with dietary use of the oils as a byproduct of using the seeds as food.

Food supplements
A number of oils are used as food supplements (or "nutraceuticals"), for their nutrient content or purported medicinal effect. Borage seed oil, blackcurrant seed oil, and evening primrose oil all have a significant amount of gamma-Linolenic acid (GLA) (about 23%, 15–20% and 7–10%, respectively), and it is this that has drawn the interest of researchers.

Oils used for biofuel

A number of oils are used for biofuel (biodiesel and Straight Vegetable Oil) in addition to having other uses. Other oils are used only as biofuel.

Although diesel engines were invented, in part, with vegetable oil in mind, diesel fuel is almost exclusively petroleum-based. Vegetable oils are evaluated for use as a biofuel based on:

 Suitability as a fuel, based on flash point, energy content, viscosity, combustion products and other factors
 Cost, based in part on yield, effort required to grow and harvest, and post-harvest processing cost

Multipurpose oils also used as biofuel
The oils listed immediately below are all (primarily) used for other purposes all but tung oil are edible but have been considered for use as biofuel.

 Castor oil, lower cost than many candidates. Kinematic viscosity may be an issue.
 Coconut oil (copra oil), promising for local use in places that produce coconuts.
 Colza oil, from Brassica rapa, var. oleifera (turnip) is closely related to rapeseed (or canola) oil. It is a major source of biodiesel in Germany.
 Corn oil, appealing because of the abundance of maize as a crop.
 Cottonseed oil, the subject of study for cost-effectiveness as a biodiesel feedstock.
 False flax oil, from Camelina sativa, used in Europe in oil lamps until the 18th century.
 Hemp oil, relatively low in emissions. Production is problematic in some countries because of its association with marijuana.
