History
The high school was founded when Westmont School District merged with Upper Yoder School District to form Westmont-Upper Yoder School District in 1919.  The high school became its current entity when Southmont School District merged with Westmont-Upper Yoder School District in 1956, forming Westmont Hilltop School District.  The current high school building opened in 1961 and was renovated in 1996.

The high school was originally located on Diamond Blvd, Southmont Borough. The former high school became the Westmont Hilltop Middle School.  The School District closed the Middle School in June 2016.

Grades 5-6 were moved to leased space adjacent to the Elementary School at 675 Goucher Street.   Grades 7-8 were moved to the High School campus.

Work is well underway, at the Diamond Avenue site, to build a new complex and relocate the Elementary School for the 2017-18 School year.

It is intended to close the existing Elementary campus at that time.

Alma Mater
The Alma Mater was written by Willard E. Ackley, the supervising principal from 1934 to 1954.

Extracurriculars
Westmont Hilltop School District offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, publicly funded sports program.

Athletics
The high school's mascot is the Hilltopper. The school's official colors are red and gray, with white and/or black often appearing in athletics uniforms. Westmont Hilltop High School is a member of the Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference for most sports. The interlocking "WH" that currently appears on the school's team uniforms and helmets was originally designed by Darren Trebel (Class of '85) in 1982 at the request of Vice Principal Jack Yoder. The design was implemented in time for the school's football team to take part in filming for "All the Right Moves" in Fall, 1983 (see Cultural References below).

On four occasions Westmont Hilltop sports teams have advanced to the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) or equivalent state championship finals; however, no WHHS team has ever won a state championship. The first team to do so was the 2002 men's soccer team, which was defeated in sudden death double overtime. The second team was the 2003 men's hockey team, which advanced to the state championship, but also lost by one goal.  The women's basketball team were state runners-up in 2005 and 2006.
