The Mary-Sue Extrusion is a novel by British writer Dave Stone featuring the fictional archaeologist Bernice Summerfield. The New Adventures were a spin-off from the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

The title of the book (a reference to a Mary Sue, an authorial wish-fulfillment character) was thought up by Kate Orman, who had been offered the slot, but declined. The title was given instead to Stone, who based the book on material he had written for an abortive standalone science fiction novel.
