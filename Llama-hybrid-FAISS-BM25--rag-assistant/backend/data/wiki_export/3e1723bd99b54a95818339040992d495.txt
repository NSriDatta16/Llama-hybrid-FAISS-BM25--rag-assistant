The Green Man was released in 2000 and is the twenty-first studio album by Roy Harper.

History

The album takes its name from an ancient character / representation found, principally, throughout Western Europe. The Green Man may be carved in stone or wood, found in churches, or painted on pub signage and is usually a representation of a face surrounded by (or made from) leaves. Harper's face can also be seen within the leaves upon the album's cover.

Canadian musician Jeff Martin plays a variety of instruments on eight of the album's eleven songs.
