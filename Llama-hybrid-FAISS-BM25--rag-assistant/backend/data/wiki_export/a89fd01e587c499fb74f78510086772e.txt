The school is a part of the North Shore School District. As of 2021, approximately 878 students attend North Shore High School. The current principal is Eric Contreras. In 2021, Newsweek ranked North Shore as the 336th best public school in the country. North Shore's athletic teams are known as the Vikings, and have a long-time rivalry with neighboring Glen Cove High School.

As of the 2022-2023 school year, the school had an enrollment of 777 students and 100 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 7.8:1. There were 99 students (13% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and  (1% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.)

In 2021, North Shore High School was recognized as a 2021 National Blue Ribbon School in the Exemplary High Performing category.

For many years North Shore has had an "open campus" policy, where students were allowed to leave campus during lunch and other free periods so they could work on independent projects. Some community members wanted North Shore to become a "closed campus," where leaving campus was not permitted during free periods. They were concerned due to automobile and pedestrian safety and possibilities of students conducting recreational drug usage off campus.
