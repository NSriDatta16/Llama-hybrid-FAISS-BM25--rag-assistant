History

Although the line through the station was opened in July 1850, the  current Balloch station was opened by British Rail and SPTE on 24 April 1988, replacing the former  station which was situated immediately north of a level crossing on Balloch Road. Closure of this level crossing was made possible by the closure of the previous terminus station, Balloch Pier, in 1986. The station is located  south of where Balloch Pier station stood. This relocation allowed the level crossing to be closed.

In 2023, it was announced that Balloch would receive a brand new park & ride facility, at a cost of Â£50,000.
