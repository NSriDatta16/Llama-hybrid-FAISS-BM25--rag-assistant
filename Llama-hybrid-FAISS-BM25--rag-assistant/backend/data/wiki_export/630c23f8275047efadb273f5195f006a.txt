The Chiquitibum (a.k.a. Alabio Alabao) is the most famous chant in Mexico called out to congratulate a person. It’s also called out after Las Mañanitas has been sung. It became widely popular for every person in Mexico.

"La Chica Chiquitibum"
During the 1986 FIFA World Cup, hosted in Mexico City, Chiquitibum became associated with Spanish-born model and actress Mar Castro when she appeared in a Carta Blanca beer commercial featuring the chant. For the next four years, she toured Mexico, sponsored by the brewery.
