History

Denio was named after Aaron Denio, who settled in the area in 1885. He was born in 1824 in Illinois and traveled to California in 1860. He worked in milling, mining, and farming in Nevada and California for 25 years before settling near the Oregon-Nevada border. He died at Denio in 1907. The Denio post office was established in Oregon in 1888. After World War II a number of businesses relocated south of the state line to take advantage of Nevada's lack of an income tax and more liberal liquor, gambling, and prostitution laws. The post office was moved and reopened in Nevada in 1950 for Nevada addresses, not Oregon.

Education
Public education in Denio (on the Nevada side) is administered by the Humboldt County School District, which operates the Denio School, a three room kindergarten-eighth grade (K-8) school. It is a two-room schoolhouse. The school lacks a full service cafeteria. Its nature, as of 2004, allows teachers to have informal, flexible scheduling. It had 20 students in the 1963-1964 school year. The enrollment in December 2004 was the same number as the 1963-1964 figure.

 Denio, Nevada, students of high school age may attend Humboldt County School District's Albert M. Lowry High School in Winnemucca, Nevada; parents with high school aged children may, while their children are high school aged, move to Winnemucca for the duration of the students' stays. Students may also attend Crane Union High School, a public boarding high school in Crane, Oregon. The Oregon side across from Denio, Nevada, is, in 2020, zoned to South Harney School District 33 (Fields School, K-8) and Harney County Union High School District 1J (the district for Crane Union). The Denio, Oregon, community was historically served by Crane Union, with the high school taking in several Basque Oregonians from there.
