A police raid is an unexpected visit by police or other law enforcement officers with the aim of using the element of surprise to seize evidence or arrest suspects believed to be likely to hide evidence, resist arrest, endanger the public or officers if approached through other means, or simply be elsewhere at another time. Various tactics are used by law enforcement in raids that often vary based on available equipment, situational factors, laws, and police powers.

Overview and methods

The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) defines a raid as "a sudden appearance by officers for the purpose of arresting suspected law violators and seizing contraband and the means and instruments used in the commission of a crime."

By country

New Zealand

Dawn raids were a common event in Auckland, New Zealand, during a crackdown on illegal overstayers from the Pacific Islands from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. The raids were first introduced in 1973 by Norman Kirk's Labour government and were continued by Robert Muldoon's National government. These operations involved special police squads conducting raids on the homes and workplaces of overstayers throughout New Zealand usually at dawn. Overstayers and their families were often prosecuted and then deported back to their countries. 

The Dawn raids were particularly controversial, as despite Pacific Islanders only making on one-third of visa over-stayers, they accounted for 86% of those arrested and prosecuted. The majority of over-stayers were from Great Britain, Australia, and South Africa. Due to opposition from the Pacific community including the Polynesian Panthers, Labour Party, and Pacific governments, the raids were abandoned by the National Government.

In April 2021, members of the Pasifika community called for an official apology, describing the dawn raids as "governmentsanctioned racism". In mid-June 2021, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed that the New Zealand Government would formally apologise for the Dawn Raids at the Auckland Town Hall on 26 June 2021.

Politicians
 Ruth Turner
In January 2007 Ruth Turner was arrested in a dawn raid as part of the investigation into the Cash for Peerages affair.  Senior Labour politicians criticised the move; but their concern about this has been contrasted by their lack of concern at other dawn raids.

Asylum seekers
Manuelo Bravo
In September 2005, Manuelo Bravo killed himself following a Dawn Raids. He and his son (13) were detained in Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre where he had been threatened with deportation to Angola, where he feared his life was in danger as other family members had been killed there.

Scotland

Asylum-seekers

Dawn raids have become a regular feature in the arrest of asylum seekers in Scotland.  These have caused a great deal of controversy and pressure has been brought to bear on the Scottish Executive to end the practise.  Several support groups have been set up to oppose the practice of dawn raids, including the Glasgow Girls, the UNITY centre in Ibrox and No Border Network which campaigns under the slogan of "No one is illegal".

There has been speculation that the practice may be coming to an end for asylum seekers following criticisms from a wide range of people.  On 1 February 2007 the deputy First Minister, Nichol Stephen condemned the practise of dawn raids describing them as "unacceptable and unnecessary."  Some have speculated that this is part of a wider change in tactics on the issue of asylum, moving away from dawn raiding asylum seekers, to detaining families at reporting centres; however, dawn raids have continued.

United States

No-knock raid

A no-knock raid is a type of police raid performed under a no-knock warrant. No-knock warrants are controversial for various reasons, and have seen increased usage from the 1960's on. There have been many cases where armed homeowners, believing that they are being invaded, have shot at officers, resulting in deaths on both sides.

The number of no-knock raids has increased from 3,000 in 1981 to more than 50,000 in 2005, according to Peter Kraska, a criminologist at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond. In 2010, Kraska estimated 60,000–70,000 no-knock or quick-knock raids were conducted by local police annually, the majority of which were looking for marijuana.

In Utah, no-knock warrants made up about 40% of warrants served by SWAT teams in 2014 and 2015, usually for drugs and usually done at night.  In Maryland, 90% of SWAT deployments were to serve search warrants, with two-thirds through forced entry. From 2010 through 2016, at least 81 civilians and 13 officers died during SWAT raids, including 31 civilians and eight officers during execution of no-knock warrants.  Half of the civilians killed were minorities.  Of those subject to SWAT search warrants, 42% are black and 12% are Hispanic.  Since 2011, at least seven federal lawsuits against officers executing no-knock warrants have been settled for over $1 million.

Dawn raids
Dawn raids are a tactic often used by law enforcement agencies in the United States. High-profile dawn raids include:

the 22 April 2000, apprehension of Elián Gonzalez by a Border Patrol BORTAC team in Florida.
the arrest of Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges
the 2006 Swift raids at six meatpacking plants, leading to 1300 arrests and many deportations

The Netherlands
During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II, the Nazis carried out numerous raids. The largest and most infamous is the Raid of Rotterdam on 10 and 11 November 1944, in which 52,000 men between the ages of 17 and 40 (some 80% of all men) from Rotterdam and Schiedam were rounded up and put on transport to labor camps.
