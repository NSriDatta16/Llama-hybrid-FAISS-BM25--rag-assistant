B̤ē () is an additional letter of the Arabic script, derived from bāʼ () with an additional dot. It is not used in the Arabic alphabet itself, but is used to represent the sound  when writing Hausa, Saraiki, and Sindhi in the Arabic script. The same sound may also be written simply as bāʾ in Hausa, undifferentiated from .

Both Hausa and Sindhi are also written in scripts besides Arabic. The sound represented by b̤ē is written Ɓ ɓ in Hausa's Latin orthography, and written  in Saraiki and Sindhi's Devanagari orthography.
