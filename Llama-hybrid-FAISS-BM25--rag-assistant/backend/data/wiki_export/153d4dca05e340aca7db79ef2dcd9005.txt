With illustrations from Tommy Lee Edwards, the comics deal with the same themes and with similar characters as the Paratwa Trilogy; it ran from 1996 to 1997. He also co-created and wrote the Dead Corps four-issue limited series for Helix, and a ten-issue story arc for Marvel's Blade which comprised Volume 2 of the series.
