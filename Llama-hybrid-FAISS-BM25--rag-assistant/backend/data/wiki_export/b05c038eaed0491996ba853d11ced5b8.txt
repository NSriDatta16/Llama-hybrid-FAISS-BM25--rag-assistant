Chinook Regional Hospital is the district general hospital for the City of Lethbridge and Southern Alberta, and offers many of the health care services for Alberta Health Services. The hospital services a population of over 150,000 and is supported by the Chinook Regional Hospital Foundation.

History
The first hospital in Lethbridge opened in 1891 by the family of Alexander Galt, a local entrepreneur. The original building now houses the Galt Museum. The Sisters of St. Martha opened the St. Michael's Hospital at 13th Street South and 9th Avenue South in 1929. In 1955, the City of Lethbridge built a municipal hospital nearby where the CRH is located today. Up until 1960, both hospitals received several expansions. The Alberta Department of Health later evaluated them and discovered both needed substantial structural upgrades. The decision was made to rebuild the municipal hospital and redesign St. Michael's as a long-term facility. Despite proposals of several locations for the new hospital, ultimately the hospital was built on the same lot as the municipal hospital allowing the latter to still operate during construction. The Lethbridge Regional Hospital opened June 24, 1988 at the cost of $118 million. The hospital was renamed the Chinook Regional Hospital in 2006. In 2016, a $127 million project saw the Hospital complete an additional five-storey hospital wing to service the growing Lethbridge community.
