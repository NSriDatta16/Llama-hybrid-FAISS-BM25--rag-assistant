Get Ready! is the debut studio album by Belgian/Dutch Eurodance group 2 Unlimited. The album includes 2 Unlimited's breakthrough worldwide hit single "Get Ready for This".

Release and reception
The album reached #12 in the Netherlands and #37 in the UK Albums Chart. Despite the moderate chart success, 2 Unlimited was one of the few bands to gain access to the difficult American market.  Although peaking at just #197 on the US Billboard 200, the album still proved consistent in sales, eventually going Gold for sales in excess of 500,000.

The exclamation mark was dropped from the title for the US and UK releases of Get Ready!

Content
The original album is divided in three parts: Vocal, Instrumental and Romantic. The US and UK versions of the album deleted most of the instrumental tracks in favor of two extended versions of the main singles.  The US and Canadian versions of Get Ready! contain the track "Pacific Walk" which was omitted from the European releases.

Ironically the success in the Dutch market was initially limited, since the band mainly relied on their Belgian producers, who preferred to focus their attention on the British market.
