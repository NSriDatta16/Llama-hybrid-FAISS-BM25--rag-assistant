The Irish Deaf Society (IDS) is the national representative organisation of the Deaf community in Ireland.  It upholds the status of Irish Sign Language (ISL), which is the first and preferred language of Deaf people in Ireland.  The Society, a growing and vital organization, provides a number of specific health, personal and social services to deaf adults, children and their families.

The IDS is recognised by the World Federation of the Deaf and The European Union of the Deaf, non-governmental organisations that represent National Associations of the Deaf at the world and European Union levels.

The Society recognizes that the Deaf have traditionally faced the threats of poverty, limited employment opportunities, and other difficulties because of the lack of public understanding or appreciation for their essential needs.  Therefore, their mission statement reads:
