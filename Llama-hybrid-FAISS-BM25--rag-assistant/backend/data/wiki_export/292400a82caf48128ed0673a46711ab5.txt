Location and History
The school campus is located on Endicott Street in Boxford off of Exit 72 on US Interstate 95. Masconomet lies at the intersection of the towns of Topsfield, Boxford and Middleton, the towns which it serves. The property is completely in Boxford, however, the mailing address was in Topsfield (until the 2014-15 school year) due to Boxford's post office being too small to handle all of Masco's mail upon the school's inception. Masconomet was created by a charter of the three towns created in 1959. Masconomet celebrated its 50th anniversary during the 2009-2010 school year. Masconomet Regional High School was named after Chief Masconomet, sagamore of the Agawam tribe that lived in Essex County at the time of the English colonization. The original school building was constructed in 1959 and rebuilt in 2002. When the school was rebuilt in 2002, the old high school building was converted into a two-story middle school and a new three-story high school was built adjacent to the middle school facility.

Classes
Masconomet offers a large selection of academic course offering. A strong core curriculum is enhanced by a large selection of elective courses. Electives include courses in EMT training, co-taught science/social studies courses, forensics, 1960s course, early childhood, and a strong variety of computer education courses including computer gaming.
