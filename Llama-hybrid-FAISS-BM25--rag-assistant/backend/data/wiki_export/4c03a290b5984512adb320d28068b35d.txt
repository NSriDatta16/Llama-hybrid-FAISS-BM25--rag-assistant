History
In the 1920s, old State Highway 337 ran from Route 1 in downtown Milford via Woodmont and West Haven center, ending at Campbell Avenue in the Allingtown section of West Haven. The old route went along current Route 162 to Ocean Avenue, then ran along the West Haven shoreline to First Avenue, then north along First Avenue. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 337 was renumbered to Route 122. Route 158 was also established in 1932 and ran along Campbell Avenue and Forest Road from West Haven center (Campbell Avenue and Main Street) to Westville (Forest Road and Fountain Street). In 1950, the Route 158 designation was removed and the portion north of First Avenue was added as a northward extension of Route 122. The portion of former Route 158 south of First Avenue was transferred to the town. In 1962, Route 122 was extended north to Whalley Avenue (Route 63) along Dayton Street. In 1966, the south end of Route 122 was truncated to end at I-95, while Route 162 was extended along the Milford portion of Route 122.
