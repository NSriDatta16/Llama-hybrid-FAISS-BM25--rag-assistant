The Art Newspaper is a monthly print publication, with daily updates online, founded in 1990 and based in London and New York City. It covers news of the visual arts as they are affected by international politics and economics, developments in law, tax, the art market, the environment and official cultural policy.

History
The Art Newspaper is published by The Art Newspaper SA and is based on an original concept by the Turin publisher, Umberto Allemandi, who founded the first monthly newspaper, , in 1983. It covers news of the visual arts as they are affected by international politics and economics, developments in law, tax, the art market, the environment and official cultural policy. The publication is fed by a network of sister editions, with around fifty correspondents in over thirty countries.

The Art Newspaper produces daily papers during the major art fairs, such as Art Basel and Frieze, and weekly podcasts on topical subjects. It is a campaigning newspaper, which has reported regularly on the trade in illicitly excavated antiquities, on damage to the heritage in warfare, and the maladministration and corruption that prevents Venice being protected from sea level rise, excessive tourism and the cruise ships.

Inna Bazhenova was granted the publishing license to the newspaper in Russia edition and in Spring 2012 The Art Newspaper Russia was launched. In 2014 Bazhenova purchased The Art Newspaper for an undisclosed sum. With the purchase she became the owner of the International edition, Chinese, Greek and French editions alongside the Russian edition which she already owned.

In 2018 the company broke relations with Le Journal des Arts and launched The Art Newspaper France. In November of the same year, The Art Newspaper Israel was founded by M.T. Abraham Group.

The Art Newspaper was bought by the AMTD Group in June 2023 and with this they announced that they planned to move the headquarters to Paris. In August, Olga Yarutina became publisher of the Russian edition. This was followed by the launch of The Art Newspaper Türkiye in September 2023.

Reviewers and commentators for the paper include: former Tate director Nicholas Serota, Performa founder-director Roselee Goldberg; former Pompidou Centre director Jean-Hubert Martin; archaeologist Colin Renfrew; Venice Biennale curator Robert Storr, writer Anthony Haden-Guest and artist Grayson Perry. The publication won the National Art Collections Fund prize in 1992.
