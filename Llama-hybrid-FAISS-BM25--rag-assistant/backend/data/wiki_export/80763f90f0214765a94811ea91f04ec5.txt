West Gonja Municipal Assembly is one of the seven districts in Savannah Region, Ghana. Originally created as an ordinary district assembly on 23 December 1988 when it was known as West Gonja District, until the southern part of the district was split off by a decree of president John Agyekum Kufuor in August 2004 to create Central Gonja District; thus the remaining part was retained as West Gonja District. However, on 6 February 2012, the northern part of the district was later split off to create North Gonja District; thus the remaining part has been retained as West Gonja District. Later, it was elevated to municipal district assembly status on 27 January 2020 to become West Gonja Municipal District. The municipality is located in the central part of Savannah Region and has Damongo as its capital town.
