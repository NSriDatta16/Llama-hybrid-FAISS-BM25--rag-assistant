Castelnuovo di Garfagnana is a town and comune in the province of Lucca, Toscana, central Italy. It is located at the confluence of the Serchio and the Turrite Secca rivers, close to the intersection of roads passing through the Apennine Mountains and the Apuan Alps.

The local economy is based mainly on the production of cereals and on the chemical and textile industries.

History
The first mention of the locality is in an official document dating back to the 8th century with the name of "Castro Novo" (new fortified settlement).

From the 13th century Castelnuovo di Garfagnana developed as a market town due to its position close to rivers which were important trading routes. Later, in the 14th century, it developed under the jurisdiction of the city of Lucca.

In 1316, control of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana was given to Castruccio Castracani, who built a bridge in order to join the castle to the village.

At the beginning of the 15th century the inhabitants of Castelnuovo di Garfagnana rebelled against the domination of Lucca, putting themselves  under the protection of the Estensi family of Ferrara in 1430. Under the Este control, the village gained in importance by becoming the first seat of Vicarship and then by building imposing religious buildings such as the Cathedral.

In 1512 the town was occupied by troops led by Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, and a few years later it was conquered by the Republic of Florence, the latter, holding the town under its control for just few years. In the following years the Estensi returned to  power; their domination lasting up to the invasion of the territory by the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte.

During French domination, Castelnuovo and the territories of the Apuan Alps became part of the Cisalpine Republic.

After the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire, in 1814 it was given back to the Estensi who ruled it until the Unification of Italy in 1861.
