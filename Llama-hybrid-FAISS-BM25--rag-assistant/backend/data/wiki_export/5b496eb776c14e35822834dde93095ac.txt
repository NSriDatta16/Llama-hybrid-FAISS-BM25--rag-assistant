William Frederick Waldegrave, Viscount Chewton (29 June 1816 in Cardington, Bedfordshire – 8 October 1854) was a British army officer.

Early life and education
Waldegrave was the eldest son of William Waldegrave, 8th Earl Waldegrave and was educated at Cheam School. While still at school, he served as a midshipman aboard his father's ship, HMS Seringapatam from 1829–31 and later graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1837. 

In 1846, his father inherited the earldom from his nephew George Waldegrave, 7th Earl Waldegrave and Waldegrave took the courtesy title Viscount Chewton.

Military career
Chewton emigrated to Canada and served with the militia which put down the rebellions of 1837.  He returned to Britain in 1843 and served with the British Army.

In 1846, Chewton fought in the Battle of Sobraon and then captained the 6th Regiment of Foot stationed at the Cape of Good Hope in 1847 and then the Royal Scots Fusiliers in Scotland in 1848. Chewton later fought in the Battle of Alma in September 1854, but died of his wounds a few weeks later.
