The Euro Cup (formerly known as the EU Cup) is an international Australian rules football tournament played between European national teams. Played under 9-a-side Footy rules, the tournament was first held at Chiswick in London, England in 2005, created by Australian Football International. A women's cup has been played between more than two teams since the 2014 tournament.

The Euro Cup is an event hosted annually by AFL Europe.

Eligibility rules are very strict compared those of other international competitions and are similar to the AFL International Cup. Generally speaking players must be a citizen of the country they represent and have lived there through roughly middle school and high school ages (when most players usually learn the key skills required) ensuring that expatriate Australians are ineligible to compete.
