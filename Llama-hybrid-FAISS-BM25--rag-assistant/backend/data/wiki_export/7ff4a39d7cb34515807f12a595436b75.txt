Granada High School is a public high school located at 400 Wall Street in Livermore, California, United States. It is part of the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District. Granada was established as the town's second public high school in response to significant population growth in the 1960s. Livermore High School was the first high school in Livermore, and rivals Granada. The name Granada is a Spanish word meaning "pomegranate". The school's official newspaper is called The Pomegranate, which is published monthly. The school mascot is a matador.

History
Granada High School is located in the midst of housing tracts in Livermore, which changed from an agrarian community to a growing suburban community at the end of World War II. This change was escalated by the development of the research laboratory that started in the 1950s as a reaction to the United States' role as a nuclear power. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is still a major employer in the community. The growth of the Bay Area as a leader in the area of technology has also changed the nature of the community, as has the recent development of the local wine industry.
