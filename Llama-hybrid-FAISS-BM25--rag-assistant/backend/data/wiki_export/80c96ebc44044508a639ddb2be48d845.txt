According to the sports newspaper L'Équipe, the Palais des sports is one of the "mythical stadiums of LNB Pro A".

History
The Palais des sports de Pau was born from the encounter between the city of Pau and Élan Béarnais (previously based in Orthez). To adapt to the demands of professionalism, the union with the neighboring city of Pau became an economic necessity for Orthez (population 10,000). In 1989, Élan Béarnais became Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez.

Economic considerations were not the only motivation for this partnership. The legendary La Moutète arena in Orthez had become inadequate over the years for a club that aimed to be a leader in French basketball. A gigantic Palais des sports was then constructed in Pau to accommodate this "new" club.

Construction was completed in early 1991, at which point Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez left the Moutète arena in Orthez and moved to Pau. The Palais was inaugurated in 1991 in the presence of Laurent Fabius, President of the National Assembly, Mayor  , Élan's president  , and many other guests. It was inaugurated during Élan's victory over Limoges CSP with a score of 109–97.

The arena is the result of the work of two architects: Jean-Michel Lamaison and Michel Camborde, and it was baptized "the ideal arena" by  magazine.

Palais des Sports de Pau has been used as the home arena of the Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez French professional basketball team, since it opened in 1991. It has also frequently hosted games of the senior men's French national basketball team, since this is the largest basketball-specific arena in France.

In 2020, on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Palais des sports, Vincent Collet, head coach of the senior men's France national team, stated, "The Palais des sports de Pau is the cathedral of our sport."

As a result, the basketball court at the Palais des sports de Pau now bears the name of Élan's historical president, Pierre Seillant, since April 11, 2022, and a Classic was won against their eternal rival, CSP Limoges.

Architecture 
The arena's design is identical to the Zénith de Pau, which is nearby the venue. 

The structure is supported by four square towers that also serve as entrances. The towers are connected by four lattice metal beams supporting a central vault that receives direct natural light. The vault's illumination is ensured by four lenses, each 50 meters long and 7.20 meters high. The roof of the Palais rises to a height of 25 meters. The transparent glass facades give the building a sense of lightness while ensuring functional transparency.
