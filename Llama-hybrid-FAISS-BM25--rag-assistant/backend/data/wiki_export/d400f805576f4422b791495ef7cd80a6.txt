Leif Erlend Johannessen (born 14 May 1980) is a Norwegian chess player, and Norway's fifth grandmaster. He received his title in 2002, and was at the time Norway's second youngest grandmaster of all times. He picked up his first norm in Oslo, the second at Bermuda and finally the third in the Sigeman tournament in Malmö. Johannessen has yet to win the Norwegian championship, the closest he has come is second place in 1999 after losing the play-off 0-2 to Berge Østenstad. Johannessen has won the Norwegian blitz and rapid championship several times though.

Johannessen usually plays 1.d4 when he is White. With Black, Johannessen employs a variety of defenses including the Sicilian Defence and Caro-Kann Defence against 1.e4 and the Queen's Gambit Declined, Slav Defense, or Semi-Slav Defense against 1.d4. 

Johannessen works as attorney. He is also the editor-in-chief of the official  Norwegian Chess Magazine.

Johannessen is an honorary member of the Portuguese amateur team Mata de Benfica and played in the Portuguese First League Team Championship in the season 2006/2007 and 2008/2009 for this team.
