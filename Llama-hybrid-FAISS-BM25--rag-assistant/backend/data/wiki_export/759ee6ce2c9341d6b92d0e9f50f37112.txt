Alma mater
The following are the lyrics to Dunmore High School's Alma Mater:

Dear Dunmore, thy honor is safe in the hands
Of thy sons and thy daughters so true.
Thy students and athletes fresh victories each year
Shall win for the Crimson and Blue.

We will strive with our might
Thy fond name to exalt.
We will sacrifice self to thee aim,
And united in heart and in hand will achieve,
Only deeds that shall add to thy fame.
