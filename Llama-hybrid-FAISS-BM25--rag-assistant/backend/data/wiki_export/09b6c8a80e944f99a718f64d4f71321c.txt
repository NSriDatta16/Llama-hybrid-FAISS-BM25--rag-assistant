Wall of Sound is a British independent record label based in London, England, and was founded by Mark Jones in 1994. They were considered to be "at the center of the revolution" of the Big Beat movement in the mid to late 90s, releasing much of the UK's Big Beat material at the height of the scene alongside Brighton's Skint Records. The label is most known for introducing internationally renowned Big Beat acts such as Propellerheads, The Wiseguys and Les Rythmes Digitales.

History
The label's first release was the acclaimed compilation album Give 'Em Enough Dope Volume One, which featured many acts such as Mekon, Kruder & Dorfmeister, and The Wiseguys before they became more notable. The compilation is also considered to be foundational to the Big Beat movement of the mid to late 90s.

The label gained international recognition and residencies were set up in cities around the globe including a yearly summer residency at Ibiza's "Manumission" (an annual club party).

Human League released their first album Credo for Wall of Sound in 2011. In September they released the album on vinyl.
