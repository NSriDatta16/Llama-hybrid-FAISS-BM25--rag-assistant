CocoCay or Little Stirrup Cay is one of the Berry Islands, a collection of Bahamian cays and small islands located approximately 55 miles north of Nassau. It is used for tourism by Royal Caribbean Group exclusively.  Little Stirrup Cay is adjacent to Great Stirrup Cay, Norwegian Cruises' private island since 1977.

Geography 
The island is less than a mile (1.57 kilometer) long from east to west and less than 480 yards (0.43 kilometer) from north to south. It has a population of 38 (2010 census).

Tourism
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which owns Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, assumed the lease of the island upon acquisition of Admiral Cruises in 1988. In 2019, the island was extensively renovated by Royal Caribbean at the cost of $250 million and renamed Perfect Day at CocoCay. Upon being announced in 2018, the renovation plans were criticised by activists, who raised concerns about harm to the environment and "natural beauty", drawing Disneyland comparisons, and to small local businesses.

A pier was constructed on the north side of the island, which allows cruise ships to dock directly instead of using tenders. A waterpark was constructed on the "thrill" side of the island, with two towers containing waterslides, including North America's tallest Daredevil's Peak, and two pools. On the "chill" side is the beach with cabanas.

The east end is the centre of recreational activities with beaches fronting a coral basin where manatees, rays, and numerous fish can be seen. Nature trails run the entire length and width of the island. The renovation also included a water park, with North America's largest and tallest water slide, Daredevil's Peak.
