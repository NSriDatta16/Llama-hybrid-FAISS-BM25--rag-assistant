History
The parish of Vevring was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.  On 1 January 1964, the municipality was dissolved and split between three surrounding municipalities:
the Steindal valley (population: 25) in the north was incorporated into the newly created Flora Municipality
the area south of the Førdefjorden (population: 407) was incorporated into Askvoll Municipality 
the area north of the Førdefjorden (population: 439) was incorporated into Naustdal Municipality

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Vevring farm () since the first Vevring Church was built there. The name of the farm comes from the name of a local stream. The stream's original name was derived from the word  which means "to roam" or "to wander", likely describing the path of the stream.
