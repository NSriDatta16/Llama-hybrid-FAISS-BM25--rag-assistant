Fresh Wine for the Horses is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Rob Dickinson. Released in 2005, it features tracks that Dickinson wrote while a member of Catherine Wheel but never made it onto official releases, as well as new material written since the band's breakup in 2000.  The album received mixed reviews from the media, but was met with enthusiastic approval by longtime fans of the band.  The release was supported by a tour of small venues across the United States and Canada, where Dickinson performed intimate acoustic sets comprising both Catherine Wheel and solo material. In 2008, the album was reissued as two disc edition with EP titled Nude, consists of acoustic version of Catherine Wheel tracks, and a slight changing of tracklist from the original release, with the addition of previously unreleased song called "The End of the World".

2008 Reissue

Billie Eilish cover 
In 2019 Billie Eilish covered "The End of the World" (a song included in the 2008 reissue) for Phil Taggart's Chillest Show on Radio 1 Piano Sessions. NME magazine wrote that «If the actual apocalypse happened to be soundtracked by this tranquil cover of Dickinson by the O’Connell siblings, we’d probably be OK with that.».
