The Niaz Stadium is a cricket ground in Hyderabad, Pakistan.  The ground has a capacity of 15,000, and hosted its first test match in 1973. It was established in November 1961 by then Commissioner of Hyderabad, Niaz Ahmed, after whom the stadium is named.

The inaugural Test match at the ground took place from 16–21 March 1973 against England, and it was resulted in a draw after big scoring England picked up 487 with Dennis Amiss scoring 158.

England played out time by hitting 218 for 6 wickets for the match to end in a draw.

The last Test played at Niaz Stadium was between Pakistan and New Zealand on 25–29 November 1984. Niaz Stadium celebrated staging the Test cricket's 1000th match with Pakistan winning the rubber with more than a day to spare. Javed Miandad became the second Pakistani after Hanif Mohammed to score a century in each innings of a Test.
