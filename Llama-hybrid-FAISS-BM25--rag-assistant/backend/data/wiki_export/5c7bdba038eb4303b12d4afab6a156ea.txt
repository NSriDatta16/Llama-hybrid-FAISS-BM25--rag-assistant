It stands on high ground in the centre of a small parish of about 562Â ha on the Greensand Ridge and is mentioned in the Domesday Book.  It is located close to the nearby towns of Ampthill, Flitwick and Woburn, Bedfordshire.

Much of the surrounding land is part of either Beckerings Park, or the Woburn Estate.  The Duke of Bedford influence can be seen in the characteristic style of the numerous workers cottages throughout the village.
