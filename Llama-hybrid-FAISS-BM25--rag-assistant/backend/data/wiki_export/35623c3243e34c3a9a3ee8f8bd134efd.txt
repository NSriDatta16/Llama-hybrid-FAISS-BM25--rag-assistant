Ub () is a town and municipality located in the Kolubara District of western Serbia. As of 2011, the population of the town is 6,164, while population of the municipality is 29,022 inhabitants.

History
The first communities established at the municipal territory of Ub, according to the historical traces and traces of human civilization discovered in the current settlements of Trlić, Kalinovac, Brgule, originated from the time of Vinča culture, in the period around 5000 BC. In the settlement of Čučuge today there are traces of the Bronze Age.
 
The most probable theory of the origin of the name is from the Latin word "urb", meaning "city". According to  legends, the place was built in the reign of Prince Kocelj, and it was named after his brother Slavoljub. Over time, the names shortened to just "Ub".
 
The most important of the cultural and historical monuments of Ub is certainly the church - monastery in the village Dokmir, dating from the fifteenth century. Research suggests that the monastery was restored in 1415, so it is thought that the monastery dates from an earlier period.  Also affiliated with the monastery are the nuns of the Žitomislić Monastery in Herzegovina, who had fled from the horrors of war in Bosnia in early '90s.
 
The Tamnava area has preserved evidences of earlier styles and ways of life. In the mountain areas were fortresses, monasteries, churches and towers, and it is often difficult to reach such areas, but in the plains, monuments and buildings were often removed, leaving little trace, barely sufficient to preserve some features of the old life.
