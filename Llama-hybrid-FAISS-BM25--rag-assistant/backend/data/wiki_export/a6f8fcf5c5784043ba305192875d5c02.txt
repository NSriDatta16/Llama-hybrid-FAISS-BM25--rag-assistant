Acoustic is an EP by American rock band Bayside, released on February 28, 2006. The release was in memory of John "Beatz" Holohan, the band's drummer who was killed when the band's tour bus crashed on October 31, 2005. By April 2006, the EP had sold over 13,000 copies. By August 2008, the EP had sold 37,000 copies.

CD
The CD includes seven studio-recorded acoustic songs (five of which had been previously released non-acoustically on past albums, and two of which were new), two previously unreleased non-acoustic songs (one of which was an Elliott Smith cover), and one live acoustic song.

The song "Winter", one of the new acoustic songs, was specifically dedicated to Holohan, and the song "Megan", the other new acoustic song, is a cover of a Smoking Popes song and features guest vocals from the Smoking Popes' lead singer, Josh Caterer.

Track listing

DVD
The DVD includes an acoustic set of the band's performance at the House of Blues, Chicago, on the Never Sleep Again Tour in 2005, a "making of the album" video, and a montage segment in memory of Holohan. The songs from the live performance that are found on the DVD include six of the seven studio-recorded acoustic songs found on the CD, with the exception of "Winter". Instead, the song "Don't Call Me Peanut" appears, which coincidentally is the live track found on the CD.
