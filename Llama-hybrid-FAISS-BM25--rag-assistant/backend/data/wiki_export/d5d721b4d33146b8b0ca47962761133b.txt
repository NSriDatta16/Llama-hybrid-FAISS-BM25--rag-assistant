Şereflikoçhisar, formerly known as Koçhisar, is a municipality and district of Ankara Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,155 km2, and its population is 33,140 (2022). It is 148 km south of the city of Ankara. Its average elevation ranges between 900 and 1,200 m, with the highest point being Mt. Karasenir at 1,650 m.

The area is a flat dry plain, the only water being Hirfanlı reservoir and the salt lake Lake Tuz. The countryside is inhospitable, with minerals extracted from the salt lake being a major source of income. Therefore, the rural population is migrating to nearby towns or abroad.
