The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg is the first video release by Depeche Mode, featuring almost an entire concert from their 1984 Some Great Reward Tour, at the Alsterdorfer Sporthalle in Hamburg, Germany on 9 December 1984. It was directed by Clive Richardson. The name is a play on a lyric of the song "Somebody" (She will listen to me, when I want to speak about the world we live in and life in general...).

The number of songs on the video depends on the region. Some have eleven, some have seventeen. The seventeen-song version was re-released in 1999, though still on VHS, in Europe only and in Japan on other formats. The United States only has the 11-song version.

Two songs that were performed during the Hamburg concert, "Puppets" and "Ice Machine" (both written by ex-member Vince Clarke), have yet to appear on any format. It is unclear why these were omitted from the original release.
