The "American Law Library" series are a series of Chinese books that are translated from American law textbooks.

In 2000, the Public Affairs Section of the American Embassy to the People's Republic of China and the China University of Political Science and Law Publishing House—as part of the US and China Presidential Rule of Law Initiative—agreed to cooperate to translate hundreds of American law textbooks into Chinese and publish Chinese editions.
