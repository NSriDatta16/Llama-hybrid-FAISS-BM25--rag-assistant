The 1st Annual TV Week Logie Awards (as they would come to be known) were the first awards ever to be awarded for work within the Australian television industry. Television had begun production in Australia only three years earlier, in 1956.

Synopsis
Although other cities had television (Sydney since its inception in 1956), the awards were for Melbourne television only. 

In 1959 the awards were given out during an episode of In Melbourne Tonight, with international star Googie Withers appearing as a guest host. Awards were given in only eight categories, two of which were for American programmes.

Awards

TV Star of the Year
The most prestigious award was the TV Star of the Year Award, which the following year in 1960 would become renamed as the Gold Logie. The star of the year was awarded to Graham Kennedy and Panda Lisner for their program In Melbourne Tonight, for the Nine Network (GTV-9).
