A day after being waived by the Texans, Spencer was claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers. He was waived again on August 7, with Panthers head coach John Fox citing "conditioning and weight" as the reason.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Spencer was re-signed to a future contract by the Jaguars on January 12, 2009. However, he was released on April 29, 2009.
