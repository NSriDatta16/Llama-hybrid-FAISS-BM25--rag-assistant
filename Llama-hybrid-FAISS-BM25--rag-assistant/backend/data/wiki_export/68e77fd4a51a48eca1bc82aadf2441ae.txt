History
The school was founded as Mara Hills Academy by the Eastern Mennonite Mission in northern Tanganyika in the 1940s, as a one-room school for the children of Mennonite missionaries.  The school moved to its current location in 1967, and opened a boarding facility offering K–9 education.

The school remained a boarding school into the 1970s when the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention (now the International Mission Board) invested in the school to provide an American education for the children of its missionaries residing in the Nairobi area.  This was also a critical financial move in the history of the school as it saved it from financial insolvency. In the late 1980s, the Assemblies of God became the third sponsoring mission.

The school remained strictly a K–9 school until the late 1980s. Most of the students transferred to the Rift Valley Academy upon entering tenth grade. However, the school gradually added a high school program and graduated its first senior class in 1991. Today, the school offers a wide-ranging liberal arts program, including courses in the social sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, literature, world languages, and the arts.  The school also has one of the largest and most successful Advanced Placement AP programs in Africa, typically offering between fifteen and twenty different courses each year, and boasting a pass rate of approximately 85% (25% above the global average).

The Rosslyn Eagles consistently place among the top of their leagues in both men's and women's varsity and junior varsity sports.  The inter-schools athletic program includes men's and women's football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, field hockey, rugby, tennis, and swimming.  The Eagles' traditional rivals are the other large international schools in Kenya, namely the Rift Valley Academy Buffalos and the International School of Kenya Lions.
