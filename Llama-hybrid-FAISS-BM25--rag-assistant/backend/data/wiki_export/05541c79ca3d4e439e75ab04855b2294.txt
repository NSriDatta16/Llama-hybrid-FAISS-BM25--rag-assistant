The Surf Trio was a surf rock band which formed in Eugene, Oregon, in 1984.

Lineup
Founding members included Ron Kleim on guitar and vocals, Pete Weinberger on guitar and vocals, Dave Meyers on bass and Aaron Temple on drums.  Dave Meyers was replaced by Jeff Martin shortly after the release of their first E.P. on Moxie records in 1985.  Terrence Kerrigan, from The Bo Diddley Headhunters, replaced Aaron Temple in August 1988 and was with the band through June 1989, when he, Martin and Weinberger, Joel Barnett, founding member of the Miracle Workers and the Bo Diddley Headhunters, and Richard Spaugh from Drivetrain and previously Dimension 7 formed The Wicked Ones.

Tim Erickson and Chuck Thompson handled the drum duties at various times during the Surf Trio's reformation in the mid-to-late 1990s.

Style
The Surf Trio recorded and played mostly original material; instrumental surf, 60's garage, pop-punk and Ramones influenced punk rock.  The band, along with The Miracle Workers and Dead Moon from Portland, Girl Trouble from Tacoma, and The Mono Men from Bellingham, were a part of the Pacific Northwest's 60s-influenced, garage rock music scene during the mid-to-late 1980s.

Releases
The group has a long list of releases on indie labels including Voxx, Moxie Records, September Gurls, BloodRed Records and Discs, Get Hip, Pin-Up and several others.
