Iser Kuperman was born in Habne, Ukrainian SSR (now Poliske, Kiev Oblast) on April 21, 1922 to a Jewish family. In 1945, he made his debut in the USSR Russian draughts championship and won first place. After that, Kuperman took first place three times. Then he began to play in international draughts and was USSR champion five times. Iser Kuperman was world champion in 1958, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1965, 1967, and 1974. He emigrated to Israel and then to the United States in 1978. After his emigration, any mention of him was purged from Soviet records.
