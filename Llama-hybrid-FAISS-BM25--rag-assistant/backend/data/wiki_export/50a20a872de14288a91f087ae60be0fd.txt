Mount Salisbury is a peak in the Fairweather Range of Alaska, 6 miles (10Â km) southeast of Mount Fairweather. Its east slopes feed one of the northern branches of the Johns Hopkins Glacier, which flows into Glacier Bay. On its western side is a large cirque, shared with Mount Fairweather, Mount Quincy Adams, and Lituya Mountain, which heads the Fairweather Glacier; this flows almost to the Pacific coast at Cape Fairweather.

Though not exceptional in terms of absolute elevation, Mount Salisbury does possess great vertical relief over local terrain: for example, the southwest side of the mountain drops over  to the Johns Hopkins Glacier in only five miles.

Mount Salisbury is not often climbed, partly due to its proximity to the higher and better-known Mount Fairweather, and partly due to difficult access and the typically bad weather that this range possesses.
