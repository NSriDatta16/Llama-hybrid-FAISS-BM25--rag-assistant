Lucius Hunt is an alternative Australian progressive rock band formed in late 2005. The band has four members: Sean Hayter (guitarist and lead vocalist), Ryan Brown (bassist and vocalist), Mark Eggleton (drums) and Dylan Bell (guitarist and keyboardist). The band hails from south of Brisbane, Queensland, and is recording their second album for the St. Cecilia Record label. The group released their first album titled Fear and Desire: The Conflict Within which contained 11 tracks in the later part of 2006.

History

The group formed after the breakup of post-punk hardcore band  in May 2005. Prior to this, the band operated as  throughout 2004 and released an 8-track self-titled EP. zer0cold disbanded briefly as the members worked on solo projects and participated in other groups of similar standing. In mid-2005, all three members of zer0cold reformed to pick up where they left off, and renamed the group  (sometimes referred to as ASD). After a series of events involving confusion with the name, ASD became Lucius Hunt in December 2005. Lucius Hunt is commonly known for brooding lyrics and a dark, haunting style and sound which typifies the group.

The band described itself on MySpace as "LUCIUS HUNT... a name that imitates and equals a dark sound and constant push forward to new levels for music. finding themselves basically sceneless, and with a style that morphs from rock to screamo they are appealing to a wide variety of the niche groups. with their inaugural release "fear and desire : the conflict within" in recording and due out early this year on st. cecilia records, LUCIUS HUNT is avidly preparing to tighten the noose around the throats of the industry. prepare for the wake...."

The album Fear and Desire: The Conflict Within was released September 2006 and was a success in the Australian Independent Music Charts, reaching number 3 during January 2007. The band subsequently toured the album nationally throughout 2007 with positive results. The band has since been working in the studio to the follow-up to "F&D," tentatively titled The Black Pegasus according to the band's MySpace page, however recently, the band has stated the album is yet to be titled.

The band's main songwriter, lead guitarist and lead vocalist, Sean Hayter, was inducted into Australasian Performing Right Association as an Australian Songwriter in November 2007, and has since provided music for a number of independent films and projects, including the Red Sparrow project.
