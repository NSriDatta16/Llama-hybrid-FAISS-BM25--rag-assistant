The Rocky Horror Punk Rock Show is a tribute album featuring the soundtrack of the 1975 cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show performed by modern punk rock bands, released on Springman Records in 2003.

Background
The album started as a project by Shawn "Eddie Migraine" Browning, who got the idea from his wife. Work for the project started in 1999. Browning said he was a "huge Rocky Horror fan back in High School", and that the show was "where some of us fit in" and "brought us all together".
