By the end of the year, 149 students were enrolled.

Transition

According to a statement issued by former interim President Dr. James Troha to all Heidelberg students: "In considering the transition from college to university, the board and senior administrators addressed such issues as competition and trends in higher education and the perception of "university" among prospective students in the U.S. and abroad. Thorough research of both internal and external audiences indicated strong support to become Heidelberg University."

On the gridiron, the Student Princes won the 1972 Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl under the guidance of head coach Pete Riesen.  Their longest stretch of success was under the tutelage of College Football Hall of Famer Paul "The Fox" Hoernemann.  The Fox led The Berg to a record of 102-18-4 in 14 seasons.  After falling on hard times in the 2000s, head coach Mike Hallett turned the program around.  Hallett snapped a nation-worst 36-game losing streak in the first game of the 2007 season.  By 2012, Hallett guided the Student Princes into the Division III Tournament.

On November 16, 2013, tailback Cartel Brooks set an NCAA All-Divisions record with 465 yards of rushing in a win over Baldwin Wallace.  On November 3, 2018, punter Austin Baker set a D-III record with a 95-yard punt in a loss at John Carroll.

They also captured their fourth OAC Championships in 2009, which added to their titles in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The Berg men's cross country team also was honored by the USTFCCCA in 2009 by having the second highest GPA in NCAA DIII and the fourth highest in the nation among all cross country teams in any division.

Wrestling has had five straight successful seasons in the OAC, and placed as high as sixth in the nation in the past five years. They captured OAC Tournament Championships in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The wrestlers were also OAC Regular Season Championships in 2006, 2008 and 2009.

Baseball has also had success over the past decade with two Regional titles, and seven OAC Championships.

Also in 2010, they captured their first NCAA Regional Championship and finished fourth in the nation at the NCAA DIII Baseball World Series. Heidelberg hosted, and won, the first-ever Mideast Super Regional in 2019—sweeping The College of Wooster.
