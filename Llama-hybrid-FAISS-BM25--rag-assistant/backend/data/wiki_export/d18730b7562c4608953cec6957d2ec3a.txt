Biography 
During her third year at Seki Shoko High School, Yoko Kumada applied for Weekly Shōnen Magazines Miss Magazine swimsuit contest. She became a finalist during the contest, but dropped out due to the opposition of her mother. Kumada attended nursing school, but could not give up her dream of being an entertainer, so she participated in Audition magazine's 2001 Special Audition, where she caught the attention of talent agency Artist-house Pyramid. From 2002 to 2003, she was a member of the group "P-Girl" with Sachie Koike, Erika Itō, and Noriko Sagara.

In 2006, Kumada released her first single  after years of vocal training. A year later, she was appointed as the tourism ambassador of Gifu Prefecture's Hida/Mino Jiman Project. In 2011, at the request of boxer Kōki Kameda, Kumada served as a ring girl during his match in Osaka. That year, she also appeared in the fashion magazine I Love Mama.
