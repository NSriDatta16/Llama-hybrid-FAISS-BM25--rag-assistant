Roman dolls

Ivory dolls belonging to Roman girls were found in a child's grave in the necropolis of the "Ontur's Eras." Four ivory dolls and an amber doll were found. The discovery was exceptional for the large numbers of examples found and the unusual amber doll. It is estimated that their owner played with them in the 3rd or 4th century AD.
The dolls can be seen in Albacete's Archaeological Museum.
