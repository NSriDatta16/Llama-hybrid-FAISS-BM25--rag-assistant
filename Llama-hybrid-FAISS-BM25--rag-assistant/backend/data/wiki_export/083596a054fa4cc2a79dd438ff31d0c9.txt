Three Good Reasons is an album by the American musician Crystal Gayle, released in 1992. Many of its songs are about the ending of a relationship. The title track was released as the album's first single. Gayle supported the album with a North American tour.

Critical reception

The Ottawa Citizen wrote that Gayle's voice "retains its other-worldly quality, that cool distance that lets her pass through any song without getting the least bit involved in it." The Richmond Times-Dispatch called the album "a smart departure from the syrupy, pops-flavored crossover hits she had in the mid-'70s." The Miami Herald noted that "a bluesy rhythm track accents 'The Trouble With Me (Is You)' while Gayle delivers a sly, '40s style performance."
