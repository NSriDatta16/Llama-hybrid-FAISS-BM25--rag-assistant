Hayim David HaLevi (24 January 1924 â€“ 10 March 1998) (),
was Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv-Yafo.

Biography
Hayim David HaLevi was born in Jerusalem. He studied under Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel at the Porat Yosef Yeshiva. When R. Uziel was appointed Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, he hired HaLevi as his personal secretary. HaLevi served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

Rabbinic career
He was appointed chief rabbi of Rishon Le-Zion in 1951. In 1964, he became a member of Israel's Chief Rabbinate Council. He became chief rabbi of Tel Aviv-Yafo in 1973, taking over from R. Ovadia Yosef. HaLevi was known for his clear-headed approach to halakha, particularly  relating to the Jewish state.  Though unquestionably tied to Sephardi minhag, liturgy and halakha,  HaLevi also included Ashkenazi halakhic positions and customs in his books and responsa.
HaLevi is said to be the first rabbi to issue a Halachic prohibition on smoking.

Awards and recognition
In 1997, HaLevi was awarded the Israel Prize, for Rabbinical studies.
