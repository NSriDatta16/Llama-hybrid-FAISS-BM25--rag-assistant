Live Phish 07.29.03 was recorded live at the Post-Gazette Pavilion at Star Lake in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, on July 29, 2003.

The band told Rolling Stone that they had recently downloaded their entire repertoire on an iPod and purposely decided to play a show of rarities on this summer night in Pittsburgh.

Choices include a very rare performance of the Velvet Underground's "Cool It Down". the only post-hiatus performance of "McGrupp and the Watchful Hosemasters", and the first version of "Harpua" since the 1998 The Dark Side of the Moon breakout, featuring the debut of Jon Fishman singing Elvin Bishop's "Fooled Around and Fell in Love".

Bonus tracks include "Piper" and "Twist" from the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California on July 9, 2003, and a jammed-out version of "Seven Below" from The Gorge in George, Washington, on July 13, 2003.

This show was also among a small batch of the 2003 live shows to be released in CD form.
