The Military Advocate General (MAG Corps') (, HaParklitut HaTzva'it) is responsible for implementing the rule of law within the Israel Defense Forces. The unit's objectives include integrating the rule of law amongst IDF commanders and soldiers; providing commanders with the tools for the effective performance of their missions in accordance with the law; and working with the IDF to achieve its goals on all legal fronts. The MAG Corps' has the ability to provide legal advice in emergencies and during warfare.

The Military Advocate General's Corps (MAG Corps) was founded prior to the establishment of the State of Israel as the "Legal Service" within "Haganah" (the quasi-military body of the Jewish community and Zionist Movement in the British mandate prior to the establishment of the State of Israel). The MAG Corps, as it is today, was established in 1948 concurrent with the IDF, as the "Military Prosecution". In 1950, the unit was renamed the Military Advocate General's Corps.

Since 2015, the Military Advocate General holds the biannual IDF International Conference on LOAC. The conference brings together world-renowned academics and practitioners (governmental and otherwise) from around the world to discuss pertinent issues in LOAC.

The Supervisory Dept. attends to criticisms of MAG bodies, and coordinates its activities with investigatory entities outside the IDF.

School of Military Law
The School of Military Law is responsible for providing training in the IDF on matters of military law and for the professional development of those serving in the MAG Corps. The School of Military Law also trains and accredits IDF officers to conduct disciplinary proceedings, and supervises disciplinary proceedings in the IDF. The School of Military Law also coordinates the process for requests by soldiers for pardons or sentence reduction.

The legal training provided by the School of Military Law to IDF commanders and soldiers include in-depth studies of military law, analysis of real events and lessons-learned, practical workshops, the use of advanced training methods and conducting certification courses. The primary topics covered in these trainings are the areas of international law relevant to IDF activity and other legal issues relating to IDF activities, such as command responsibility. The School of Military Law also operates the Military Training and Exercise Administration, the purpose of which is to challenge IDF commanders with the legal aspects of operational scenarios during trainings and exercises that take place in the IDF.

The School of Military Law is also responsible for training and accrediting officers and soldiers in the MAG Corps, upon their arrival to the unit and throughout their service. For decades, the School of Military Law has run the Legal Officer Training Course, which constitutes the MAG Corps' accreditation course and is the flagship course for MAG Corps officers. This course is the bridge between legal studies in university and the military context, and prepares dozens of new officers annually for the challenges they will face in their new roles as they join the ranks of the MAG Corps. The School of Military Law also provides advanced command and management courses for officers, a course for soldiers serving as legal assistants, and more. Additionally, the School of Military Law runs continued legal education courses, professional seminars and conferences.

The School of Military Law responsibility extends to training and accrediting officers to be able to adjudicate disciplinary hearings for soldiers ("disciplinary officers"). The School of Military Law trains all officers in the IDF to become "disciplinary officers", and conducts specialized training for senior officers and officers who are appointed to adjudicate special offences.

The School of Military Law also provides ongoing instruction and advice to commanders and soldiers with respect to disciplinary proceedings, among others, through a designated call center. The School of Military Law provides regular advice to commanders regarding their authorities and particular disciplinary proceedings. The School of Military Law also provides information to soldiers regarding their rights and provides them with the option to ask questions regarding their particular disciplinary proceedings.

The School of Military Law coordinates the supervision of disciplinary proceedings in the IDF on behalf of the Deputy Military Advocate General. The School of Military Law assists the Deputy Military Advocate General in examining claims by soldiers with respect to the standard of the disciplinary proceedings conducted against them, and to deal with cases that require intervention, including invalidating proceedings or ordering a new hearing. This is all done in accordance with the authority conferred to the Deputy Military Advocate General pursuant to Military Justice Law.

The School of Military Law arranges filing requests for pardons or sentence mitigation by soldiers to the President of the State of Israel. In this context, the School of Military Law handles such requests by soldiers convicted in the Military Courts, and assists a committee headed by the Chief Education Officer, which considers requests to expunge the criminal records of soldiers who were convicted prior to his or her enlistment in the IDF.

The School of Military Law operates the Secretariat of the Military Committee for Sentencing Review.
