"Here I Go Impossible Again" is a song written and recorded by English synth-pop duo Erasure. It appears on the band's eleventh studio album Nightbird and Mute Records released this song together with "All This Time Still Falling Out of Love" (also from Nightbird) as a double A-side, the third single release from this album.

Written and produced by Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell, "Here I Go Impossible Again" features graceful synthesized instrumentation and a smooth vocal delivery from Bell (due to his intricate, multi-layered background parts). "Here I Go Impossible Again" was remixed slightly for its radio mix. As they had done with previous single "Breathe", Erasure provided downloadable software on the compact disc single which allowed buyers to create their own remix of the track.

The double A-sided single peaked at number twenty-five on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Erasure's thirty-first UK Top 40 single.

A cover version of the song was recorded by Australian artist Peter Wilson (singer) for his album Pulsation in 2013.
