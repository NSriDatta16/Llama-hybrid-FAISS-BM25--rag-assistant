History

Founding and early history
On June 5, 1872, pastors and delegates of nine Baptist churches in the Dakota Territory gathered in Vermillion, South Dakota, at the first meeting of the Baptist Association.  They adopted the following resolution:  "Be it resolved that we take immediate steps for the establishment of an institution among us and that we devote a suitable portion of time at each annual meeting of the consideration of this important subject and give our individual associated influence to encourage a more general and complete education of our youth under distinctly Christian influence."

Under the name of Dakota Collegiate Institute, secondary and collegiate programs began on September 8, 1883. The institution's name changed to Sioux Falls University in 1885, with the secondary program called the academy and the collegiate department branded Sioux Falls College. Although the college grew, the academy's enrollment declined, forcing it to close in 1925.

Between 1929 and 1931, Sioux Falls College acquired four Baptist schools that had ceased to operate: Des Moines University, Des Moines, Iowa; Grand Island College, Grand Island, Nebraska; Cedar  Valley Seminary, Osage, Iowa; and Parker College, Winnebago, Minnesota. With the 1931 merger of Grand Island College with what was still legally Sioux Falls University, the institution's official name became Sioux Falls College.

During the Second World War, the college lost its accreditation and offered 200 students, mainly women, two-year degrees. Enrollment surged when the veterans returned home, only to lapse to meager numbers two years later. Financially, the school was in dire straits.

Expansion
Reuben P. Jeschke (1953–1970) helped regain full, regional accreditation in 1958, and under his leadership enrollment grew from 378 in 1958 to 1,006 in 1968 – a 166 percent increase. The institution's endowment, although modest, also grew, and what Jeschke described as a "near miracle" happened – a history of balanced budgets.

The most-visible change during this time was the campus. Jeschke oversaw the building of Mears Library, Salsbury Student Union, Salsbury Science Center, Jeschke Fine Arts Center and three residence halls. In fact, Time magazine featured the college's growth in 1967. The caption read: "Seven Buildings in Seven Years." The subtitle added: "But our stature comes from people." By the end of Jeschke's tenure, Sioux Falls College was well-positioned for the steady success of the 1970s and 1980s.

The 1980s saw the addition of a Degree Completion Program and graduate studies. Today, USF offers four graduate programs: Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Education Specialist (Ed.S.), and a joint doctoral degree in leadership with the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minn. USF also offers adult education programs: accelerated nursing and RN-to-BSN.

Sioux Falls College became the University of Sioux Falls in 1995.

Dr. Mark Benedetto became the 22nd president in 1997.

Dr. Brett Bradfield became the 23rd president in 2017 after working at the University for 16 years.

In 2008, USF received a $2 million Title III grant from the Department of Education to start a nursing program. This grant provided funds for two simulation labs and the renovation of existing science lab facilities. The nursing program offers a 15-month accelerated program, an RN-to-BSN program and a traditional undergraduate program.

In 2011, the university added the USF Sculpture Walk to its campus and publicly kicked off its fundraising campaign titled the Uncampaign that ran through 2020.

In 2012, USF built a new Media Studies Center, created a new Music Technology lab for Music majors and added an IdeaLab for Entrepreneurial Studies majors.
