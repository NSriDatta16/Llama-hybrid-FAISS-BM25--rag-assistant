The National Circus School () is a professional circus school located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is for higher education in the art of circus. The NCS also offers academic subjects at the secondary and college levels. It is one of the only circus school in the Americas to offer professional programs in circus arts: Preparatory program, Circus and High School Studies, and Higher Education in Circus arts. It also prepares professional circus arts educators.

History
In 1981 at the Immaculate Conception Center, a circus school begins to attract young artists interested in theatrical acrobatics. Soon the Immaculate Conception Center could no longer contain the rapid growth of the National Circus School (NCS). In 1989 the school moved to the Dalhousie station facilities in Old Montreal. The only institution to offer professional circus teaching in North America, the NCS has become one of the world's circus schools.

The need to train a greater number of versatile and highly skilled artists, by now the hallmark of the Quebec circus, is apparent. The NCS launches into a new phase of growth that sees it relocating to the Cité des Arts du Cirque as a founding member, along with Cirque du Soleil and En Piste, the national network for circus arts. In 2003 the NCS completes the move to a new building custom built to its specifications in the heart of Tohu, as this new complex is known.

In addition to circus arts training, the NCS also offers academic subjects at the secondary and college levels.

Programs

Preparatory program
The first level of training, this extracurricular program is aimed at students 9 to 13 years old. This program allows students to continue their primary in another school. Disciplines taught during the program are dance, acting, physical training, manipulation, balancing, acrobatics and aerials.

Circus and High School Studies Program
This arts/academic program is offered to students in Grades 7 through 11.

The following academic subjects are taught as outlined by the secondary teaching schedule of the Quebec Ministry of Education: French, English, mathematics, science and technology, human biology, geography, social studies, history, economics, career choice, morality instruction and personal and social development. Disciplines taught during the program are dance, acting, physical preparation, manipulation, balancing, acrobatics and aerials. French is the language of instruction for both academic subjects and circus art training. However, the School's French immersion program favors Canadian students who have not previously attended a French-language school.

Intensive summer camps
