The external nasal nerve is the terminal branch of the anterior ethmoidal nerve (its continuation beyond the inferior border of the nasal bone). The external nasal nerve passes inferior-ward through the lateral nasal wall. It provides sensory innervation to the area of skin of the nose between the nasal bones superiorly and the tip of the nose inferiorly (excluding the alar portion surrounding the external nares).
