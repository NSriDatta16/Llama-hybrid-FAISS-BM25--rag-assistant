Chunghye of Goryeo (22 February 1315 – 30 January 1344, r. 1330–1332, 1340–1344), born Wang Jeong (), was the 28th king of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

Biography
He was remembered in the Goryeosa for his licentious lifestyle, particularly his habit of abducting, raping, and killing women. King Chunghye was the son of King Chungsuk of Goryeo and Queen Gongwon, a Hong. He is sometimes known by his Mongolian name, Putashiri, which is rendered in hanja as Butapsilri ().

King Chunghye travelled to Yuan Dynasty China in 1328. In 1330, then-king King Chungsuk petitioned to abdicate the throne, and the emperor sent King Chunghye back to Goryeo to assume the throne. But in the following year, King Chungsuk returned to the throne and King Chunghye returned to China. In 1339, King Chungsuk died. One faction supported the noble Wang Go's claim to the throne, but their attempted coup failed and King Chunghye's reign was restored.
King Chunghye's queen was Princess Deoknyeong, who gave birth to King Chungmok.

After his father's death, Chunghye raped one of his father's concubines, Princess Gyeonghwa, who attempted to flee Goryeo. Chunghye imprisoned her in the palace. The Yuan emissary eventually visited the palace to visit Princess Gyeonghwa, who informed him of what had transpired. Then, the Yuan emissary arrested Chunghye and dragged Chunghye to Beijing. Chunghye was dethroned, forced to remain in the court of the Yuan Dynasty, and his son ascended the throne of Goryeo.
