Pustoi Island (Taĝilgadax in Aleut) () is an island in the Fox Islands group of the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska.  It is 0.3 miles across and is located in Umnak Pass 2 mi north of Ship Rock off the northeast coast of Umnak Island.  The name is derived from the Russian "Ostrov Pustoy," meaning "desert island," a name given to it by navigator Peter Kuzmich Krenitzin and published by Captain Tebenkov in 1852.
