"The Nile Song", written by Roger Waters and sung by David Gilmour, is the second song from Pink Floyd's 1969 album More, the soundtrack to the film of the same name. It was released as a single in 1969 (only in France, Japan and New Zealand), and included on the 1971 compilation album Relics.  While Pink Floyd never played the song in concert, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets performed it in 2018.

While the rest of the More album was issued in true stereo, "The Nile Song" was mixed in mono and processed into Duophonic stereo for release.

Composition
Andy Kellman of AllMusic feels that "The Nile Song" is "one of the heaviest songs the band ever recorded". The chord progression is a series of modulations, beginning at A and then rising a whole step with each repeat, cycling through six different keys, returning to the starting point of A and continuing this pattern as the song fades out. The song's style has been described as heavy metal, acid rock and hard rock.

David Gilmour – lead vocals, guitar
