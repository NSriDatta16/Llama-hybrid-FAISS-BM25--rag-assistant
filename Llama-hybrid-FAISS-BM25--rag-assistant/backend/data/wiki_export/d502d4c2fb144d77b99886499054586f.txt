After VE Day, PC-1140 returned to the United States, arriving in Key West, Florida on 14 June 1945. She was scheduled for Pacific operations; however the war came to a conclusion before her deployment.  Instead she served in training exercises off the coast of Florida until 6 November 1946 when she returned to Norfolk. PC-1140 was decommissioned in January 1947 and joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.  While berthed at Green Cove Springs, Florida, she was given the name Glenwood, after the cities in Mills County, Iowa and Pope County, Minnesota on 15 February 1956.  Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1960 and she was disposed of by Navy sale in March 1961.
