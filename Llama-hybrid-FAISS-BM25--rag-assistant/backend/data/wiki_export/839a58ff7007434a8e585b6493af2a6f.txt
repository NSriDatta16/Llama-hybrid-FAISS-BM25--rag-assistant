Commercial Breaks, provisionally entitled 'Commercial Breaks' (doesn't it?), is the eighteenth studio album by Roy Harper. It was recorded in 1977, intended for release in 1978/79, but not officially released in its entirety until 1994.

History 
A dispute between EMI and Harper over funding and content prevented the planned release of this album (Harvest (SHSP 4077)) though a few test pressings do exist. Of the originally intended ten songs, seven were eventually released on the 1988 Awareness Records release Loony on the Bus (AWCD1011). One track, "Sail Away", was released in advance as a single at the time of the release of Bullinamingvase (1977), the single's label noting that it was "Taken from the new LP "Commercial Breaks"", Harper's proposed next album.

The 1994 Science Friction release (HUCD016), included the original track listing plus two bonus tracks, (both previously released on Loony on the Bus) i.e. "Burn The World (Part 1)" and "Playing Prisons". Three of the album's songs ("I'm In Love With You", "Ten Years Ago" and "The Flycatcher") were re-recorded for Harper's 1980 release, The Unknown Soldier.

The album cover features logos, products and advertising, primarily from television commercials of the era. Most visible are the Smash Martian, Honey Monster, Michelin Man and a large pack of Wrigleys gum.
