Central Asia Monitor was an important publication for Central Asian Studies during the 1990s. It began publication one year after the Central Asian Republics gained independence. The top scholars in the field published their works in the journal and it helped revived Central Asian Studies, a field of study that had been in decline for the previous half century.
