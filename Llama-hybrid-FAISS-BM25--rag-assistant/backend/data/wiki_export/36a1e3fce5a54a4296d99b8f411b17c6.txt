"I'm Deranged" is a song written by David Bowie and Brian Eno in 1995 for the album Outside. Musically and lyrically, it shares many themes with "Look Back in Anger" from Lodger (1979), including the appearance of an angel figure before an artist. The two songs were frequently played together during the 1995 Outside Tour.
