From 1961 to 1964, Berry played on the Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team under coach Forddy Anderson. At Michigan State, Berry was the top team rebounder for the 1962–63 season with 184 total rebounds and 9.2 per game. Berry earned his bachelor's degree in 1965 and master's degree in 1969 from Michigan State, both in physical education.

Coaching career 
Berry began his coaching career in 1966 as head varsity basketball coach at Highlands High School of North Highlands, California and stayed as coach until 1969. After completing his master's degree at Michigan State, Berry became head coach at Cosumnes River Junior College from 1970 to 1972. Then, Berry became an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level with California until 1977. Berry then returned to his alma mater Michigan State to be an assistant coach under Jud Heathcote and was part of the coaching staff of the 1979 NCAA championship team that featured Magic Johnson.

From 1979 to 1989, Berry was the head men's basketball coach at San Jose State. For the San Jose State Spartans, Berry had a 142–144 record, then the Spartans' second-highest win total under one coach. Under Berry, San Jose State had a 17–12 record in the 1979–80 season, won the 1980 PCAA tournament, and made the 1980 NCAA tournament. In a 21–9 season in 1980–81, San Jose State qualified for the 1981 National Invitation Tournament. San Jose State also had three straight seasons over .500 from 1984 to 1987. However, the 1988–89 Spartans finished 5–23. In January 1989, when the team was 5–11, 10 of the 14 players on the Spartans men's basketball team accused Berry of "mental cruelty" and refused to play or practice under Berry as coach. However, the players declined to provide specific examples. Berry then organized a new team of walk-on athletes, including star football player Johnny Johnson. San Jose State dismissed Berry after the season on March 24, 1989.

Berry coached two games, both losses, and Bill Cartwright became permanent head coach effective December 28. On September 7, 2006, the Washington Wizards announced that Bill Berry would join the team as an assistant coach to head coach Eddie Jordan.
