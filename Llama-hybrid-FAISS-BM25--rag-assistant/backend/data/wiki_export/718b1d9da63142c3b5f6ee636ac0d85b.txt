Taftan or taftoon () is a leavened flour bread from Iran, introduced to South Asian cuisines.  It is made with refined flour, milk, yoghurt, and eggs and baked in a clay oven. It is sometimes flavoured with saffron and a small amount of cardamom powder, and may be decorated with seeds such as poppy seeds.
