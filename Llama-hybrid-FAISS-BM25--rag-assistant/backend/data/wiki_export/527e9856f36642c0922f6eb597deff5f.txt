James Michael Lachey (born June 4, 1963) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the San Diego Chargers, Los Angeles Raiders, and Washington Redskins. He was drafted by the Chargers in the first round of the 1985 NFL Draft with the 12th overall pick.

He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, earning All-American honors.  He was a three-time Pro Bowl player in 1987 with the Chargers, and 1990 and 1991 with the Redskins as a member of "The Hogs."  He helped the Redskins win Super Bowl XXVI.  He was also a three-time All-Pro selection. After his playing career, he became a radio analyst for Ohio State football.

Personal life
Lachey later became a broadcaster and wrote a book called Jim Lachey: The Ultimate Protector.

Lachey currently is a radio broadcaster for Buckeyes football games. His son Luke, currently a tight end on the Iowa Hawkeyes football team, says Jim encouraged him to make his own college decision, "pick wherever I want to go, it’s not about anyone else.”

Lachey coached for the Columbus Destroyers during their run to the XXI Arena Bowl in 2007.
