Visions from the Spiral Generator is the fourth full-length album by Swedish progressive/folk metal band Vintersorg. It was released on 24 June 2002. This album saw a drastic shift in style in the band that was foreshadowed on the band's prior album, Cosmic Genesis. The lyrics continued to be mixed between English and Swedish, and the music continued to be even more progressive and technical, moving farther away from the band's original folk influences.
