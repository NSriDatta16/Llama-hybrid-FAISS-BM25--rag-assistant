The Huntsville Channel Cats was a professional ice hockey team based in Huntsville, Alabama.  The franchise was a member of several different leagues, the Southern Hockey League (1995–1996), the Central Hockey League (1996–2001) and the South East Hockey League (2003–2004).  They played their home games at Von Braun Center Arena in downtown Huntsville.

Early years (1995–1999)
In 1995, two doctors in Knoxville, Tennessee, John Staley and John Minchey, created a new hockey franchise in Huntsville to join the newly expanded Southern Hockey League. The Channel Cats won the league's first and only championship, as the SHL folded later that year.  The Channel Cats then joined the Eastern Division of the Central Hockey League for the 1996–97 season.  The Channel Cats remained with the CHL for five seasons winning the CHL championship (Ray Miron President's Cup) in 1999.

New ownership (2000–2004)

Following the 1999 championship win the team was sold to a Boaz, Alabama, businessman, John Cherney.  Cherney felt that the team had a bad name with the local business community and changed the name of the team to the Huntsville Tornado along with the team colors to red and white.  Many fans took offense to the new name that referenced a tornado that struck South Huntsville in 1989, killing 21 people.  The new 2000–01 seasons saw many fan favorites leave the team, and a drop down in the standings which resulted in a drop in attendance.  Amid concerns over sharing arena space and weekend dates with the Alabama-Huntsville Chargers hockey team and the new NBDL Huntsville Flight basketball team, as well as the CHL's desire to contract to more south-central US markets, the team did not compete in the next two seasons.  Cherney had also threatened to move the team to Madison, a suburb of Huntsville, if he did not get the dates he wanted, to no avail.

In 2002, Cherney became involved in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL), but in 2003 founded a new league named the South East Hockey League (SEHL).  After the formation of the league, he asked the Huntsville hockey community if he would re-establish a team  what name they would like to see play, the Tornado or Channel Cats.  The public responded with the Channel Cats.  The Channel Cats were revived for the 2003–04 season and win the only SEHL league championship in the four-team league.

End of a dynasty
Following the 2003–04 season, both the SEHL and World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2) fell into disarray.  Keith Jeffries, president of HSV Sports, LLC and whose company had been contracted to run the Channel Cats front office during the 2003–04 season (and also operated the Tennessee Valley Vipers AF2 franchise) made a bid to have a new hockey team in the upstart Eastern Hockey League (later to be renamed the Southern Professional Hockey League before the league's first season) be placed in Huntsville.  The new league would join teams from the now-defunct WHA2 and soon to be defunct SEHL.  The Von Braun Center chose to accept the new franchise over the Cats, bringing an end to the Channel Cats name.  Other teams from the SEHL soon followed Huntsville's lead and joined the SPHL as well.  The new franchise was named the Huntsville Havoc, and successfully carried on the history of pro hockey in Huntsville.
