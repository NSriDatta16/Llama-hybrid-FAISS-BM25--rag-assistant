Jesse James became a hero in folklore and dime novels before he was killed in 1882. A manifestation of this was the emergence of a wide body of music that celebrates or alludes to Jesse James.

Folk song

The most famous song about Jesse James is the folk song "Jesse James" recorded in 1924 by Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and subsequently by many artists, including Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, The Pogues, The Country Gentlemen, Burl Ives, Willy DeVille, Van Morrison and Bruce Springsteen on his 2006 album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.

The song by Australian singer-songwriter Dave Graney, "Robert Ford On The Stage", from Graney's 1989 Album, "My Life On The Plains" (Dave Graney With The White Buffaloes).

The song weaves a haunting narrative, mixing references to the closing moments of an imaginary Australian Rules Football match, and the bizarre stage-show created by Robert and his older brother not long after the assassination, which toured the countryside, and in which they enacted for audiences how James was shot in the back by the man who once worshipped him as a hero.
