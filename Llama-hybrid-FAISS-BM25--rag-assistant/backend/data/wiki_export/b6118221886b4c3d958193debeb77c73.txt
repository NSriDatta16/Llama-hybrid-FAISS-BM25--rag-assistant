Nunthorpe is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Middlesbrough in North Yorkshire, England.

It is part of the historic county of Yorkshire, North Riding. It is near to the village of Great Ayton and formerly part of the Ayton ancient parish until 1866.

History 
The history of Nunthorpe can be traced back to before the Domesday Book of 1086. The village was  named “Thorpe”, or “Torp” (words meaning settlement) in the Domesday Book and described as a thriving settlement, Nunthorpe consisted of an estimated 1,080 acres of land. Towards the end of the 12th century a group of Cistercians nuns, allegedly evicted from nearby Hutton Lowcross for rowdy behaviour, were resettled at Thorpe having been given some land there belonging to Whitby Abbey, on which they built a priory and mill. The nuns only stayed at Thorpe a few years, but their short stay resulted in Thorpe being renamed Nunthorpe. During the following centuries, Nunthorpe remained an agricultural community closely linked to the market towns of Stokesley and Ayton. The Industrial Revolution had very little impact on its agricultural economy.

Victorian era 

The census of 1811 shows Nunthorpe to have had a population of 128, living either in the village of Nunthorpe or on nearby farms. Nunthorpe was at that time registered as being in the North Riding of York, in the Parish of Great Ayton. Its economy was all related to agriculture and farming.
The rapid growth of Middlesbrough from a population of 35, in 1811, to a population of 91,302, in 1901 appeared to have had little effect on Nunthorpe, which kept its agricultural throughout the 19th century. Nunthorpe's population in comparison only reaching 198 persons by 1901.

In 1853, Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway line opened, with a station at Nunthorpe and passenger services the following year. Several important Middlesbrough industrialists chose Nunthorpe as their home and contributed to the development of the village. These men included Isaac Wilson, +ironmaster, Mayor of Middlesbrough and later Liberal MP, John Swan, ironmaster, William Hopkins, ironmaster and mayor of Middlesbrough and Sir Arthur Dorman, ironmaster.

20th century 

The settlement that is known as Nunthorpe today is that which grew up around the railway station. Nunthorpe village is situated about  to the south of the main suburban area. In the early 20th Century, Sir Arthur Dorman planned and built a new small suburb around the railway station for his workers He imposed several covenants on the building: – shops were not permitted, public houses were also not allowed, the houses had to have slate roofs and were not permitted to have house numbers. The layout included tree-lined roads, with spacious houses, each with a garden built in terraces. The houses were certainly an improvement on the small workers’ houses built in Middlesbrough. By 1912, about 60 houses had been built around the station area of Nunthorpe.

1950s to the present 

New housing estates, schools and churches were built during the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.. The historical development of Nunthorpe initially started with the building of generously sized houses in generous gardens. This has given Nunthorpe its continued heritage with an open and spacious character.

Governance 
The village was merged into the County Borough of Teesside from the Stokesley Rural District in 1968. It was split between the boroughs of Middlesbrough and Langbaurgh (in 1996 the latter was later renamed Redcar and Cleveland) by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974, the Esk Valley Line as a boundary, with its civil parish on the Middlesbrough side. In the same ward as the western part of the village, Ormesby was also split between the two boroughs.
