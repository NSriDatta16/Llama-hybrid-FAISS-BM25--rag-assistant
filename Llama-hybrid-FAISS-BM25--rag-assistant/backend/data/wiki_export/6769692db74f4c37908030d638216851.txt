Saint Charles North (SCN) High School is a public four-year high school, located in St. Charles, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Community Unit School District 303 which also includes Saint Charles East High School.

History
Originally, the main campus was built in 1995 by Hestrup & Associates as Wredling Middle School with a capacity of 1300; in 1999â€“2000 it was expanded and converted into St. Charles' second high school at a cost of $41,600,000.

In spring 2001, a serious mold problem was discovered at St. Charles East, the district's other high school, and was determined to be the source of some student illnesses. East students received an extra two weeks of spring break while school board officials decided on the best recourse. For the rest of the 2000-2001 school year, East and North students both used the North campus, on a split schedule, East students in the morning and North students in the afternoon. After repairs, which totaled nearly $30 million, classes resumed their normal locations and schedules the following school year.

In 2006, Saint Charles North had an average composite ACT score of 22.6 and graduated 100% of its senior class. Saint Charles North has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, a state test which is mandatory under the No Child Left Behind Act.
