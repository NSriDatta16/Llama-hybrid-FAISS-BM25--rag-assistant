Jean-Paul Yaovi Dosseh Abalo (born 26 June 1975 in Lomé, Togo) is a former Togolese football defender and current coach of the Togo national under-20 football team.

Club career
Abalo played for six seasons in the French Ligue 2 with Amiens SC. In 2006, he moved to APOEL in Cyprus, where he won the 2005–06 Cypriot Cup. Whilst at Amiens, Abalo played in the 2001 Coupe de France Final. It was his penalty miss that proved decisive as Amiens lost to Strasbourg.
