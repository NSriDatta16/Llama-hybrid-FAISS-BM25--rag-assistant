Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'Cause I Love You Too Much, Baby is the fifth solo album by the American Music Club singer/songwriter Mark Eitzel, released in 1998. A starker follow-up to his previous album, it was the first album he released for the independent label Matador Records. The album has contributions from the Sonic Youth member Steve Shelley, the guitarist Kid Congo Powers and the Yo La Tengo bass guitarist James McNew.

The title is taken from the opening line of Elvis Presley's late-period hit "Suspicious Minds".
