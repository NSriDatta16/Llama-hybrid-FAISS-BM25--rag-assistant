William Chrisman High School is a high school located in Independence, Missouri, United States, as part of the Independence School District.

History
The school was founded in 1888 and was known as Independence High School.  The first building was located at the intersection of Pleasant and Truman Road, the current location of the Palmer/Central Office Building.  It is from this location that President Harry S. Truman, First Lady Bess Truman, and Truman White House Press Secretary and Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Griffith Ross graduated in 1901.

In 1917 the Independence School District passed a levy and bond to build a new high school building.  Margaret Chrisman Swope offered to sell the district land for the new school at the southeast corner of Union and Maple for $1 in exchange for naming the school after her father, William Chrisman.  Chrisman had served as a member of the first school board in 1866 and was also a prominent lawyer and banker in the community.  The new building opened in 1918 as William Chrisman High School.  The high school moved to its current site in 1956, at the northeast corner of Noland Road and U.S. Route 24 (Independence Avenue), when a major addition was added to Ott Elementary School and the building was converted into the high school.  Since that time the building has undergone numerous additions.
