Jehoshaphat ben Josiah (Hebrew: יהושפט בן יאשיהו) was the son of Josiah ben Saul, the great-grandson of Anan ben David, a Nasi, and a Rosh Yeshivah, during the early ninth century. He lived in Israel where he was head of the Palestinian Yeshiva. Jehoshaphat was nasi and resh galuta of the nascent Karaite movement of Judaism, though it is likely that he was a Rabbanite himself due to his affiliation with the Palestinian Yeshiva. He was the father of Boaz ben Jehoshaphat. His brother Semah was head of the Palestinian Gaonate after him.
