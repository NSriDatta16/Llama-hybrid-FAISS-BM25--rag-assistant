Kurt Weitzmann (March 7, 1904, Kleinalmerode (Witzenhausen, near Kassel) – June 7, 1993, Princeton, New Jersey) was an American art historian who studied Byzantine and medieval art.

He attended the universities of Münster, Würzburg and Vienna before moving to Princeton in 1935, due to Nazi persecution. He is well known for the time he spent researching the icons and architecture at Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1964 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978.
