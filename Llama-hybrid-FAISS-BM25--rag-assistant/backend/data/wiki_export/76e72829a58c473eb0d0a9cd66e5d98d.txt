Raymond Saunders is a Canadian clockmaker who has designed and built more than 150 customized clocks that mainly serve as tourist-attracting public artworks. In 1977 he was commissioned to build a steam clock for the Gastown district of Vancouver, Canada. The Gastown clock may be the first steam clock ever built although there is evidence that 19th century British engineer John Inshaw made a steam clock after which was named a Birmingham pub. Saunders has since built six different public steam clocks for clients such as the city of Otaru, Japan, and the Indiana State Museum. He has also built a clock for Vancouver's York House School's 78th birthday in 2010.

In 2019, Saunders was badly injured in a fall and has since been semi-retired.
