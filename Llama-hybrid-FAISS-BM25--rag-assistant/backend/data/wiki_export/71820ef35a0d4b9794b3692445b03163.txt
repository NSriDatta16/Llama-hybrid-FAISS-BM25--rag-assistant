Western Guilford High School is located in Greensboro, North Carolina, and is part of the Guilford County School system. The school has approximately 1,300 students and its sports teams are the Fighting Hornets.

The school opened in the fall of 1968.

In September 2000, Western Guilford was renovated via public bond. The design of the new addition integrates different components of the campus by introducing new circulation patterns. A new entry gallery at the front entry to the school was designed; along with art and classroom additions that form an internal courtyard. The addition consists of four basic elements: Classroom addition to the vocational building, a new "auxiliary" gym, a two-story classroom addition and a single-story art addition.

Keith Barnett is the principal of Western Guilford High. The Student-Teacher ratio is 18:1. The school's mascot is Buzz the Hornet and the school colors are Black and Old Gold. Western is a member of the Metro 3A Conference and the Athletic Director is Christopher Causey.

Beginning the program in 2014, Western Guilford High School was North Carolina's first high school to offer College Board's AP Capstone Program. The AP Capstone Program, also known as the Advanced Placement Academy, is a challenging two-year program designed to train students for the independent research and collaborative projects common in college-level courses.
