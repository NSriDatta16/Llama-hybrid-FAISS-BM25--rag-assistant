In 2022, total world crude steel production was nearly 1.9 billion tons (Mt). The biggest steel producing country is currently China, which accounted for 54% of world steel production in 2022. In 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, China became the first country to produce over one billion tons of steel. In 2008, 2009, 2015 and 2016 output fell in the majority of steel-producing countries as a result of the global recession. In 2010 and 2017, it started to rise again. Crude steel production contracted in all regions in 2019 except in Asia and the Middle East.
