Tiger-Cats head coach Jim Trimble said before the game that his team would "waffle" the Blue Bombers.

Hamilton started well, opening a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. Winnipeg had gotten within one point when the Hamilton coach made a controversial call.

Instead of downing the ball before half time, coach Trimble elected to punt the ball away on the last play.  The punt was blocked, and recovered in the end zone by Bomber Norm Rauhaus to give them a 20-14 half-time lead. "We should have won the 1958 Grey Cup but there was a bad coaching error before halftime," said Hamilton defensive lineman Angelo Mosca.

In the second half, Hamilton came back to tie, but a Hamilton fumble was recovered by Bomber Gord Rowland which led to a touchdown by Winnipeg fullback Charlie Shepard. Hamilton again fought back to take the lead 28-27. Winnipeg quarterback Jim Van Pelt scored on a trick play where he pitched the ball to running back Leo Lewis, who passed back to Van Pelt for the touchdown. A Sheppard punt single closed out the scoring.
