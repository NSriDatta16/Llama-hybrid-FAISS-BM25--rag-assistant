History
Kuwait SC is the oldest football club in Kuwait, the first to be founded after independence. The club is also called "Al Kuwait" and Al Ameed, which translates to "the oldest club in the nation". Members of the club during the 1980s formed a part of the Kuwaiti team which reached the FIFA World Cup 1982. The second golden age for the club was in the 2000s, as they have been winning most of the league titles and participating in AFC Cup. In 2009, Kuwait won the first AFC Cup winning against Al-Karamah from Syria with the victory of 2–1. In 2011, they reached the AFC Cup final, but they lost against Nasaf Qarshi from Uzbekistan. The club became champion of AFC Cup in 2012 and 2013 defeating Arbil from Iraq with 4-0 and Al-Qasdia from Kuwait.

Kuwait SC has been growing steadily over the last two decades from 2000 to 2020, over the two decades the team has won many domestic titles and Asian titles in the form of AFC CUP. Kuwait SC has been also among the teams to represent Kuwait in international tournaments including the Arab Champions Cup.

Kuwait SC is a team based in Kuwait City. There are two other teams in the capital of Kuwait: Al Arabi SC, and Kazma SC, who are naturally the team's rivals. The 2000s were a new era of dominance for Kuwait SC alongside Qadsia, which is based in Hawalli. The dominance of both sides for almost 10 years winning all local tournaments between them has created an important rivalry between both teams; Kuwait SC and Qadsia have met in more than 6 finals in the Emir Cup and Crown Prince Cup. They also met in the 2013 AFC Cup final, which was won by Kuwait SC.
