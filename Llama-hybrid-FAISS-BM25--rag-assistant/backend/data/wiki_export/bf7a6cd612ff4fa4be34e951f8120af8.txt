Grounds 
The stadium has been welcoming the team since 2007 at the Fez Stadium, which has a capacity of 45,000 spectators. The construction of the sports complex began in early 1992, and it was expected to be completed in February 1997, as it was scheduled to host the African Youth Cup next to the honorary stadium of Meknes, but the failure to complete the workshops prevented that, after the completion period knew stops And several failures as a result of technical problems added to the original financial envelope in financing the project, which was what led the interests of the guardianship ministry and the urban group of Fez in 1999 to find another support for the completion of the project, The urban group contributed three million euros, and the concerned ministry contributed eight million euros, while the amount allocated for the completion of this sports landmark, which has a capacity of 45 thousand spectators, was estimated at 35 million euros.
