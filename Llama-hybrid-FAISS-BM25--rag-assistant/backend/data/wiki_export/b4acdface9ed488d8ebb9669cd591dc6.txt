The United States Hockey League began in 1961 as a semi-professional ice hockey league.  Starting with the 1979–80 season, the league became a strictly Amateur league, and began awarding its champion the Clark Cup Trophy. All champions of the USHL are highlighted in this page.

Clark Cup
The Clark Cup is the current trophy awarded annually to the winner of the United States Hockey League Tier 1 Junior Hockey playoff champions.  The Clark Cup was named in honor of Don Clark, the long-time registrar of the Minnesota Amateur Hockey Association.  Clark was also the recipient of the NHL's Lester Patrick Trophy for his contributions to hockey in the United States.  The Clark Cup is one of two trophies that can be won by any team in a given year, with the other being the Anderson Cup which is awarded to the team with the most points in the standings at the end of the regular season.
