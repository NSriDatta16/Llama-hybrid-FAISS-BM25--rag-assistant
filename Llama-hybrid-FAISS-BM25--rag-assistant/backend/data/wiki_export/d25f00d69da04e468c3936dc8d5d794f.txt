Evidence that the history of Bunyan is very old can be understood from the existing caves and ruins in the villages near the district. It is understood that it dates back to the Hittites from 4000-1200 BC. It was Turkified during the Anatolian Seljuk State, which experienced Iranian, Assyrian and Roman cultures. The region was annexed to the lands of the Ottoman Empire by Yavuz Sultan Selim in 1515.

The district, which used to be called Sarımsaklı, was removed from the Pınarbaşı (Aziziye) district of Sivas Province in 1895 and became a district by gaining the name of Bünyan-ı Hamid. This name means "The Structure of Hamid". As a result of the declaration of the Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, the Ottoman Sultan II. With the abdication of Abdülhamid, the name Hamid was abolished and his name continued as Bünyan. In 1912, it was separated from Sivas province and connected to Kayseri Province.
