Plot
Raj Kumar "R.K." Gupta (Sanjeev Kumar) leaves his first love Shanti (Waheeda Rehman) to marry a wealthy heiress, Kamini (Gita Siddharth). Kamini's father, Seth Dindayal, makes him an equal partner in his business. Shanti comes by to wish him success in his marriage, with the news that she is pregnant with his child. She refuses R.K.'s offer of support, telling him that he is only doing so to assuage his guilty conscience, and leaves the city. She gives birth to a boy and names him Vijay Kumar (Amitabh Bachchan). 

25 years later, Shanti dies. The adult Vijay comes to Delhi to take revenge by ruining his father's business and family connections. At the same time, R. K. Gupta's second son, Shekhar (Shashi Kapoor) returns from abroad to take his place in his father's company. Shekhar and his sister Kusum (Poonam Dhillon), who are Vijay's half-siblings, are caught in the crossfire of Vijay's revenge. Vijay crosses paths with Geeta (Raakhee), the devoted secretary to R.K. Gupta. He tries to bribe Geeta to get details of Gupta's tender bids but she refuses. Nevertheless, the two start to get closer to each other. Vijay bribes another R.K. employee, Bhandari, to get his information. Bhandari’s betrayal nets Vijay’s company, Shanti Constructions, a lot of profits and results in losses for R. K. Gupta and Sons. Upon seeing Vijay and Geeta together one day, R.K. assumes that Geeta has sold him out and fires her. When Vijay learns about this, he exposes Bhandari to R.K. and Shekhar as the real culprit to clear Geeta’s name and hires her to work at his own company. 

Vijay becomes successful quickly and is soon celebrating the second anniversary of Shanti Constructions with a huge party. He tells Geeta to invite the crème de la crème of the city, especially R. K. Gupta. At the party, Vijay meets Sheetal Verma (Hema Malini), P. L. Verma's daughter and general manager, who is also Shekhar Gupta's girlfriend. He tries to create differences between Shekhar and Sheetal. A fierce rivalry begins between Vijay and R.K., in which both are willing to sacrifice their wealth and integrity. Vijay even encourages Kusum to marry her lover Ravi (Sachin) against her father's wishes. This angers Shekhar and he ends up fighting with Vijay. Geeta intervenes and reveals to Shekhar that he and Vijay are brothers. Shekhar and Kusum both leave their father's house in shame. Shekhar asks Vijay to give Kusum away at her wedding as her oldest brother. Enraged, R.K. hires Balwant Rai (Prem Chopra) to kill Vijay.

Vijay visits R.K. to claim victory and tells him that he is Shanti's (and R.K.'s) son. Gupta tries to rescind the order that he has given Balwant, but Balwant has already kidnapped Ravi in order to get to Vijay. With the assistance of Shekhar and R.K., Vijay rescues Ravi. During the confrontation, Balwant tries to shoot Vijay but R.K. takes the bullet for him. Balwant and his goons are arrested. With his last breath, R.K. asks Vijay for forgiveness. Vijay forgives him and unites with the family. In addition, Vijay changes the name of his company from Shanti Constructions to Shanti-Raj Constructions.
