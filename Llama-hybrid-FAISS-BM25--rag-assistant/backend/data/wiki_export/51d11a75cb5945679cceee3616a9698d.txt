Dusted is the debut album by the alternative rock band the Gin Blossoms. It was released through San Jacinto Records, a small independent label as a 12-song tape and record in 1989.

Seven of the songs on this album were re-recorded by the band after they signed to A&M Records. "Keli Richards" and "Angels Tonight" were re-recorded and included on the 1991 EP Up and Crumbling. "Hey Jealousy", "Found Out About You", "Cajun Song", and "Lost Horizons" were re-recorded and included on Gin Blossoms' 1992 album, New Miserable Experience. "Idiot Summer" was re-recorded during the sessions for New Miserable Experience, but was not released until it was in the movie Wayne's World 2. The song was also a b-side on the original single release for Follow You Down and can now be found on streaming services both on the  Til I Hear It From You  EP as well as the Deluxe Edition Reissue of New Miserable Experience.

The album in general has a faster tempo and a less produced sound than New Miserable Experience.
