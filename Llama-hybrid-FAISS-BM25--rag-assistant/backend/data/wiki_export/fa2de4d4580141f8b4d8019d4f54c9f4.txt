The Danish General Workers' Union (, SID) was a general union representing mostly unskilled and semi-skilled workers, in Denmark.

History
The union was founded in 1897 as the Danish Workers' Union (DA), becoming the Danish Workers' and Specialist Workers' Union (DASF) in 1959, then in 1974 adopted its final name.  It organised workers who were considered unskilled, or semi-skilled, in industries where the most skilled workers were represented by other unions.  This sometimes led to conflict, as it argued that the lowest-paid workers should receive the highest wage increases, to reduce pay differentials.

Over the years, numerous smaller unions have merged in to the Metalworkers' union. These include:

 1934: Danish Land Workers' Union
 1971: Danish Glass Workers' Union
 1972: Danish Gardeners' Union
 1973: Danish Paviours' Union
 1978: Danish Drivers' Union
 1983: Paper Industry Workers' Union
 1988: Ceramic Confederation
 1994: Danish Union of Bricklayers
 1994: Danish Seamen's Union
 1998: Danish Clothing and Textile Workers' Union
 2000: Graphics Federation (stationery section)
 2001: Danish Postal Union
 2001: Brewery Workers' Union

The union affiliated to the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) on formation, but left in 1925, rejoining in 1937.  From its formation until 1990, the SID was the largest union in Denmark, but it was then surpassed by the Danish Union of Commercial and Clerical Employees.  By 1997, it had 319,680 members, of whom about 37% worked in production, 31% in construction, 24% in transport, and the remainder in various other sectors.

At the end of 2004, the union merged with the Danish Women Workers' Union, to form the United Federation of Danish Workers.
