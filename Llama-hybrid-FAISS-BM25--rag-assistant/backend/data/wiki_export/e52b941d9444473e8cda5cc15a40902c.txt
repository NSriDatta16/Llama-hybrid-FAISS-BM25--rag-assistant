Random! Cartoons is an American animated anthology series that aired on Nicktoons. Much like Oh Yeah! Cartoons, it was created by Fred Seibert and produced by Frederator Studios and Nickelodeon Animation Studio. It premiered on December 6, 2008, and ended on December 20, 2009.

Production
Creator Fred Seibert ordered 13 half-hour episodes (39 7-minute segments) for the series, which was originally announced in 2005 as the fourth season of Oh Yeah! Cartoons. Production on the series started in 2005 and ended in 2007. Originally slated to air on Nickelodeon by the end of 2007, it was later halted for release in 2008 on the separate Nicktoons Network channel. The shorts were first released on air and online individually in January 2007.

Unlike Oh Yeah! Cartoons, there is no host. On January 10, 2006, ASIFA-Hollywood hosted an advance screening of six shorts as well as a Q&A session with the filmmakers at the Nicktoons Studios in Burbank, California. Two of the shorts were selected to become television series and one of the shorts was selected to become a web series. Those shorts were Adventure Time, The Bravest Warriors and Fanboy. Adventure Time began airing as a full-length series on April 5, 2010, on Cartoon Network. The Bravest Warriors, under the new name Bravest Warriors, began airing on November 8, 2012, on Cartoon Hangover. Fanboy, under the new name Fanboy & Chum Chum, began airing as a full-length series on November 7, 2009, on Nickelodeon.
