RoboCop: Alpha Commando is a 1998â€“1999 animated series based on the Orion Pictures film RoboCop and the series/films that followed. It is the second animated version of the character, following on from RoboCop. The series premiered in first-run syndication on September 7, 1998, and ran until February 3, 1999. It was syndicated by The Summit Media Group. The show aired on Sinclair's KidsClick programming block in 2017 from July 1 to September 10. 40 episodes were produced.

Synopsis
The series is set in the year 2030 (2020 in the pilot episode), and deals with RoboCop being reactivated after five years offline to assist a federal high-tech group, "Alpha Division" in their vigilance and struggle against DARC (Directorate for Anarchy, Revenge, and Chaos), a highly advanced terrorist organization, and other forces of evil, whenever that may be, globally or nationally.

The series shared many of the same writers who had contributed to the 1980s animated series, but had even less in common with the films or television canon that it was based on: RoboCop has numerous gadgets in his body that were never in the film, such as roller skates and a parachute. The absence of Anne Lewis was never explained. Besides RoboCop / Alex J. Murphy himself, Sgt. Reed is the only character from the movies to be present in the series.

The show also suffers from major continuity errors: during the first episodes, RoboCop's son is shown in flashback memories and appears to be around 10; however, he later appears to be exactly of the same age and even wearing the same clothing. The names of RoboCop's wife and son were also changed to Susan and Richie; however, this is explained in episode 10: after Alex Murphy became RoboCop, his family was forced to change their identity to keep RoboCop's enemies from locating them.

Unlike the movies, and previous TV incarnations, RoboCop never takes off his helmet in Alpha Commando.
