Ramon Antonio Peña (born January 9, 1982), is a Dominican former professional baseball pitcher.

He throws a 4-seam and 2-seam fastball, slider, and a changeup. Pena's slider is considered to have above average break, and his 4-seam fastball is better than his stats would indicate, judging by velocity and control.

Peña was signed by the Arizona Diamondbacks as an undrafted free agent on June 13, 2002. Peña played under the identity of his nephew Adriano Rosario in his first two seasons of Double-A baseball.

He finished the month of May going 2–1 with a 1.88 ERA with three holds. Peña picked up his first save of the season on May 8 against the Philadelphia Phillies, second of career. He pitched 12 scoreless innings of relief from June 5 to 28, the longest streak of the season by a D-backs reliever.
