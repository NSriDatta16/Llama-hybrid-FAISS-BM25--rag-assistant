"Don't Say You Love Me" is a song written, produced and performed by English synth-pop duo Erasure. The track was released by Mute Records as the second single from the duo's eleventh studio album Nightbird. Although essentially a synth-pop song, "Don't Say You Love Me" had elements of doo-wop and girl group influences in its rhythm and lyrical structure. The song was remixed twice by Jeremy Wheatley when released as a single, one which gave the song a smoother, more electronic music feel (the single mix) and one which was a harsher dance number (the radio mix).

While the prior single "Breathe" and subsequent single "Here I Go Impossible Again" / "All This Time Still Falling Out of Love" both offered downloadable software on their limited edition CD singles for creating remixes of the respective songs, "Don't Say You Love Me" instead offered a separate website with a Macromedia Flash-based remix applet that allows the user to purchase custom remixes as MP3 downloads. As an incentive, each unique combination of the song's tracks can only be purchased once.

"Don't Say You Love Me" became Erasure's twenty-ninth Top 20 single on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number fifteen. In Germany, the single hit number sixty-nine.
