The Full Ponty was a music festival first held in Pontypridd on the 27â€“28 May 2006. The name Full Ponty is a pun on Full Monty, and Ponty, the local nickname of the town. The festival is associated with The Pop Factory and is held at Ynysangharad Park, with additional "Fringe" events taking place at various venues throughout Pontypridd, including comedy, and up-and-coming bands. The event's organisers stated a lack of big-name acts as the reason for no Full Ponty 2008 but then promised that it would return in 2009, though no further festivals have been held since. The TV show that launched the event (The Pop Factory) is also no longer in existence, which was another factor in the demise of the event.
