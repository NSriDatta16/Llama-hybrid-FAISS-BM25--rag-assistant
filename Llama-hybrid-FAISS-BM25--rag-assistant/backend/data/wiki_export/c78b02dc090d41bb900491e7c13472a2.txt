For-profit colleges that became non-profit colleges
Conversions from for-profit to nonprofit are legitimate when the assets and income are fully committed to the educational purpose, and control by private interests is eliminated. Some converted nonprofits may not be legitimate. A Government Accountability Office report about the problem is anticipated.

 Ashford University became non-profit in 2018 and was subsequently acquired by the University of Arizona in 2020.
