County ward is an electoral division of Liverpool City Council. The ward is within the Liverpool Walton Parliamentary constituency.

Background
The ward was created in 1953 where three councillors were elected. The boundaries were changed for the 1973 and 1980, 2004 and 2023 elections.

1980 boundaries

A report of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England published in November 1978 set out proposals for changes to the wards of Liverpool City Council, maintaining the number of councillors at 99 representing 33 wards. County ward was represented by three councillors.

The report describes the boundaries as "Commencing at a point where Walton Lane meets Spellow Lane, thence northwards along said Spellow Lane and Goodison Road to Winslow Street, thence northwestwards along said street to County Road, thence northwards and northeastwards along said road and in continuation in a straight line to the centre of the Rice Lane roundabout and the southern boundary of Warbreck Ward, thence generally northeastwards along said boundary to the western boundary of Pirrie Ward, thence southeastwards along said boundary and southwards, northwestwards and southwestwards along the western boundary of Clubmoor Ward to the Liverpool Exchange-Broad Green railway, thence northwestwards along said railway to Walton Lane, thence southwestwards along said lane to the point of commencement".

2004 boundaries

A review by the Boundary Committee for England recommended that the council was formed of a reduced number of 90 members elected from 30 wards. County ward was changed to gain small parts of the former Warbreck ward, and losing parts to the new Clubmoor ward. The ward boundaries follow the northern property line on Taylors Lane, Tressel Street, and Herbarth Close, Rice Lane, Queens Drive, Moor Lane, around the northern boundary of Walton Hall Park, Walton Hall Avenue, Stanley Park Avenue North, the Canada Dock Branch line, Walton Lane, Spellow Lane, Carisbrooke Road until Margaret Road thereafter behind the eastern property line to the Maghull to Liverpool railway.

The population of the 2004 ward at the 2011 census was 14,045.

2023 boundaries
In 2023 the ward boundaries were changed following a 2022 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, which decided that the previous 30 wards each represented by three Councillors should be replaced by 64 wards represented by 85 councillors with varying representation by one, two or three councillors per ward. The ward was reformed as a two-member ward, retaining the majority of the former County ward, losing  Walton Hall Park and the streets to the north of Breeze Hill to the reformed Walton ward, and the triangle between Queens Drive, Walton Hall Avenue and Stanley Hall Avenue North to the new Clubmoor West ward. The ward contains Goodison Park, Walton Parish Church and Alsop High School.

The population of the ward at the 2021 census was 11,388.
