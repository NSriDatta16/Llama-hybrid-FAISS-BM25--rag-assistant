The Connacht School's Rugby Senior Cup is an annual rugby union competition for secondary schools affiliated to the Connacht Rugby Branch of the IRFU.

History

The Connacht School's Rugby Senior Cup is an annual rugby union schools competition organised by the Connacht Rugby Branch of the IRFU. Boys, usually of seventeen or eighteen years of age, compete for the cup with rival schools from within the province of Connacht. The competition was first held in 1913, with Garbally College, Ballinasloe the first Champions.

The first round matches are typically played towards the end of January, with the final being played in the Galway Sportsgrounds the week before Saint Patrick's Day.

Historically, Garbally College have been the most successful school in the competition lifting the cup 48 times, while Coláiste Iognáid have been the most successful team since the turn of the millennium winning eight titles in years 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2016 and 2017.

The current holders (2023) are Sligo Grammar School who defended the title won in 2022 by beating Marist College, Athlone by 28-07 on 22 March 2023 in the Galway Sportsgrounds.

Competition structure

The Connacht Rugby Schools Cup is a three tier competition;

Senior Cup [Senior A Cup]

The premier competition played by the strongest rugby playing schools in the region. 
Current competition format is two pools [A & B] of three teams playing each other round robin.
The Winners & Runner Up in each pool proceeding to the Semi-Finals. 

 Winner Pool A vs Runner Up Pool B
 Winner Pool B vs Runner Up Pool A

The two other tiers cater for schools who cannot consistently compete at Senior Cup level by reason of playing population or experience.

In total 30 Schools representing all five provincial counties participated in the various Connacht Rugby Senior Schools Cups in 2019.

Connacht Senior Development Cup [Senior B Cup]
Is the Second Tier Competition for schools with established Rugby programs but who due to lower playing numbers or do not have the high level of population experience to consistently compete at Senior Cup Level. 
Nine schools compete in three pools of three, leading to semifinals and a final.

Connacht Senior Emerging Cup [Senior C Cup]
Is the Third Tier Competition for Schools who have recently introduced Rugby programs within their schools.
Nine schools compete in three pools of three, leading to semifinals and a final.

The target is for schools to establish themselves within the lowest tier initially, and progress through to the highest tier.
