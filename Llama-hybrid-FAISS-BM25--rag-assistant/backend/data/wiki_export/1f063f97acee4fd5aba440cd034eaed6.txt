Helge Thiis (16 August 1897 – 1 August 1972) was a Norwegian architect. He is most noted for service as head architect at the restoration of Nidaros Cathedral.

Background
Helge Thiis was born in Trondheim, Norway. He was the son of curator and  museum director, Jens Thiis (1870–1942)  and  Ragna Vilhelmine Dons (1870–1939).  The family moved to Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1908, when his father was appointed director at the National Art Museum (now the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design).

Helge Thiis took his final examination in 1915 and began studying architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, receiving his diploma in 1919. He worked 1920-23 as assistant architect for Arnstein Arneberg in Oslo, followed by architect Gunnar Asplund in Stockholm, and again in Oslo with the architectural firm of Andreas H. Bjercke (1883-1967) and Georg Eliassen (1880-1964). He was an art critic at the Norwegian daily newspaper, Nationen, from 1924 to 1929.

Nidaros Cathedral Restoration

Helge Thiis was head of  the Nidaros domkirkes restaureringsarbeider (Nidaros Cathedral Restoration Work). In 1929, he had won the competition for the reconstruction of  the design of the west front and central tower of the Nidaros Cathedral.  It included the redesign of the main octagon tower, the helmet and  the completion of the Nidaros Cathedral West Front.

Most of it was covered with recesses for statues in the French Gothic style. The reconstruction of Nidaros Cathedral thus became an important arena for many of the leading Norwegian sculptors. Many of Norway’s leading sculptors joined in creating the western façade, working for several decades. Thiis was appointed as the cathedral architect, a position he held from 1930 until his death in 1972.

Personal life
He was married to painter Greta Swendborg (1896-1982). Their daughter Tone Thiis Schjetne (1928–2015) was a sculptor. He was appointed Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1953.
