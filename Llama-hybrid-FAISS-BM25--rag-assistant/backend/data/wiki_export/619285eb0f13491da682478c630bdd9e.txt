The Lethrinidae are a family of fishes in the order Perciformes commonly known as emperors, emperor breams, and pigface breams.

These fish are found in tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and Lethrinus atlanticus is also found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. They are benthic feeders, consuming invertebrates and small fishes. Some species have molariform teeth which they use to eat shelled invertebrates, such as mollusks and crabs.
