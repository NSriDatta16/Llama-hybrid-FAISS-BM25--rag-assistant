Theatre Communications Group (TCG) is a non-profit service organization headquartered in New York City that promotes professional non-profit theatre in the United States.

The organization also publishes American Theatre  magazine and ARTSEARCH, a theatrical employment bulletin, as well as trade editions of theatrical scripts.

History

Theatre Communications Group was established in 1961 with a grant from the Ford Foundation in response to their then arts and humanities director W. McNeil Lowry's desire to foster communication  and cooperation among the growing community of regional theatres throughout the country. Though initially run as a Ford Foundation administered program, TCG independently incorporated in 1964.

The organization began with a membership of 15 regional and community theatres, and nine university drama departments under the leadership of Pat Brown. In its first decade of operation, other leaders included Michael Mabry, Joseph Zeigler and Hartney Arthur. In 1972, Peter Zeisler was named Executive Director, a position he would hold for 23 years. Under Zeisler’s leadership, TCG created many of its longest-running programs, including annual National Conference, American Theatre magazine and TCG Books.

After Zeisler retired in 1995, the organization was led by John Sullivan, (1993–1997) Ben Cameron (1996–2006), and Joan Channick (1999–2006). TCG was named the United States Center for the International Theater Institute in 1999 and Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre in 2005.

, TCG has over 700 member theatres located in 47 states; 12,000 individual members; and 150 University, Trustee and other business affiliates. Teresa Eyring was appointed Executive Director in 2007.
