Loyalist Collegiate and Vocational Institute (LCVI) is a secondary school (high school) located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. It is commonly referred to as simply "LC". The school is located at 153 Van Order Drive in the city's Calvin Park neighbourhood. It was built to serve newly developed areas in what was then the west end of the city, where thousands of new homes were being built in the early 1960s. Loyalist was the third public high school in the city and was needed to accommodate the first wave of the baby boom generation then entering their teen years. Construction began in 1962 and classes began in fall 1963. The official opening was held October 6, 1964.

LCVI hosted elementary school students when it first opened, since construction of Calvin Park Public School, located across the street from the high school, had not yet been completed. The elementary school portion of Loyalist was given the name "Loyalist Senior Public School" (LSPS).

The school was built to accommodate up to 2,000 students. When Loyalist first began operation, secondary enrollment was 715. At the beginning of its second year (1964), enrollment was 984. Enrollment at LSPS in 1963 was 270, and increased to 300 in 1964. Enrollment in 2010 was approximately 750, but had further reduced to just over 500 students by 2015. Peak enrollment (near capacity) occurred in the early 1970s, when the school was by far the largest in the area, and the major decline toward today's numbers started in the early 1980s as the last of the baby boom generation graduated. Following the closure of Queen Elizabeth Collegiate and Vocational Institute in 2016, students already attending QECVI were transferred to LCVI, and enrollment is now projected to be stable until about 2020.

Under principal John "Jack" Linscott  from 1963 until 1984, LCVI was highly successful in combining technical and trades education with traditional academics. The school was also an early leader in implementing International and English as a Second Language programs.

As when it first opened, LCVI again shares space with grade 7 and 8 students who attend Calvin Park Public School. Calvin Park Public School was previously a kindergarten to grade 8 school which opened in 1965 in a separate building directly across the street from LCVI. The original building now serves as an adult education centre.

The school colours are Kelly green, white and gold, and sports teams use the name "Lancers".

Starting in the fall of the 2021/22 school year L.C.V.I will merge with Calvin Park to be one grade 7 to 12 school.
