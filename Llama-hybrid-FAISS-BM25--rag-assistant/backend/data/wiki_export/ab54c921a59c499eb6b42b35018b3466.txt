is a 1932 black-and-white Japanese silent comedy film directed by Yasujirō Ozu. It was the first of six Ozu films to win the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year.

The film's story centers on two young brothers whose faith in their father, an office worker, is shaken by what they perceive as his kowtowing to the boss.

Plot
The Yoshi family has just moved to the Tokyo suburbs, close to where the father Kennosuke's direct boss, Iwasaki, is staying. Kennosuke's two young sons Keiji and Ryoichi are supposed to be going to school, but owing to the threats of a group of neighborhood and school bullies, they decide to play truant. After the teacher speaks to their father, Keiji and Ryoichi have no choice but to go to school. They attempt to eat sparrow's eggs to get stronger so that they can get back at the boys, but an older delivery boy Kozou decides to help them out to threaten the bullies, and they emerge as the top dogs amongst the gang.

One of the neighborhood kids is Taro, whose father is Iwasaki himself. The boys argue amongst themselves who has the most powerful father. Not long after, they visit Taro's home, where the office workers have gathered under Iwasaki, who screens some home movies for the amusement of the gathering. The two brothers witness on film how their father, who to them is stern and whom they look up to, plays the buffoon before his colleagues and boss.

Humiliated, they go home and decide that their father isn't such an important person after all.  They throw a massive tantrum, and confront their father asking him why he has to grovel under Taro's father. Kennosuke answers that Taro's father is richer and holds a higher position than he does. Dissatisfied with this answer, the two decide to hold a hunger strike.  Ryoichi gets a spanking from his father, but after the children have gone to bed, the father confides in the wife that he does not enjoy doing what he does.  Both wish for a better future for their children.

The next day, the children attempt a hunger strike during breakfast, but succumb to a dish of onigiri. Kennosuke manages a reconciliation with them. The children say they would like to be a lieutenant general and a general respectively. On their way to school, they see Taro's father in a car, and they urge their father to go up and greet him. As Kennosuke takes a convenient car ride to work, the brothers walk to school with Taro and the rest of the gang.

Reception
I Was Born, But... has a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.97/10. It also has a score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic. A. O. Scott wrote, "Everything in this film is utterly believable, so much so that at times it seems almost anecdotal, a sweet little anthology of kids doing the darnedest things. That it is more — a small masterpiece, perfect in design and execution — almost goes without saying, but the film’s profundity and its charm go hand in hand." In 2009 the film was ranked at No. 59 on the list of the Greatest Japanese Films of All Time by Japanese film magazine kinema Junpo. It ranked 183rd in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.

Author and Film Critic, Stephen Amos claimed, "There is an underlining darkness in the film, one that reflects the difficulty of the time and the inevitability of disappointment – a theme which laces much of Ozu’s work."

Home media
In 2011, the BFI released a Region 2 DVD of the film as a bonus feature on its Dual Format Edition (Blu-ray + DVD) of Good Morning.

The film is also available as part of The Criterion Collection's Eclipse series DVD box set "Silent Ozu: Three Family Comedies".

In 2017, The Criterion Collection's DVD and Blu-ray reissues of Good Morning included a remastered edition of the film, complete with new musical score.

Remake
Ozu later loosely remade the film as Good Morning (1959).
