Wallyford is a village near Musselburgh and approximately  east of Edinburgh in East Lothian, Scotland.

History

The village was initially populated by coal miners and later grew as an overspill/commuter town for workers in Musselburgh and Edinburgh. A tribute to the miners can be found marked on a stone through the main road (Salters Road) of the village. A coal mine at Wallyford was worked for the profit of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1563 and also supplied coal for her own fire at Holyrood Palace.

The village is overlooked by the restored Fa'side Castle which was destroyed by the English after the Battle of Pinkie in 1546. In 2016, construction began to regenerate the village. A new, replacement Primary School was completed in February 2019.  A new village high street/centre will be created alongside a legible hierarchy of roads and footpaths, maximising connections throughout but in particular to the Village Centre and Community Woodland.

Wallyford has a railway station with a Park and Ride facility, on the Edinburgh to North Berwick railway line, operated by ScotRail.
