Plot 
Violeta lives with her uncle, because her mother died soon after she was born and she never knew her father. In addition to her uncle, Violeta stays with her grandmother from time to time as well. Violeta has a boyfriend named Ángel who gives her a pet dog.

While at her grandmother's house, Violeta discovers a time machine that her grandfather built, so she and her friends travel to different time periods. They visit several important events in Mexican history, learning these stories firsthand. The adults also end up traveling in time with the kids, and then it takes them all to recent time periods like the 1980s, where Violeta meets her mother and witnesses her own birth and her mother's death.

Later, she reunites with her father who is a well-respected doctor, and, after telling him and her uncle that she has found a time machine, they make a plan to save her mother the minute she gives birth to Violeta and take her to the future. Violeta's father successfully saves her mother.

Violeta's mother later wakes up and is told that she is in the future, and she sees that her daughter was the same girl who helped her to the hospital.
