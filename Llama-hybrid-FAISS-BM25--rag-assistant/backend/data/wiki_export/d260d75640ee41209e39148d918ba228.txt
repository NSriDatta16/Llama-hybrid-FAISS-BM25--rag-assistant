Sefton Council is the governing body for the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in the county of Merseyside, north-western England. The council was under no overall control from the 1980s until 2012 when the Labour Party took control. It is a constituent council of Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

History
Sefton Council was established on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 which created a two-tier system of local government in the United Kingdom.  It was initially a metropolitan district of the metropolitan county of Merseyside and then became a metropolitan borough on 17 April 1975 following the grant of a Royal Charter. 

Following the Local Government Act 1985, The Merseyside County Council was abolished on 31 March 1986 and its functions  were devolved to the five metropolitan borough councils of Merseyside and joint-boards. As a result, Sefton Council is a unitary authority within the ceremonial county of Merseyside, which is served by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside.

Sefton Council is not directly responsible for transport, waste-disposal and emergency services. These are administered by
the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority, Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service and the Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner which have their own legislative powers. Sefton Council appoints members of the Council to represent the Council on those bodies.

The Labour Group gained 5 seats at the elections and the Liberal Democrat Group gained 1 seat as a result of Councillor Sinclair D'Albuquerque joining them on 13 May 2023. 

Previously, Councillors Terry Jones (Ainsdale Ward) and D'Albuquerque (Cambridge Ward) had left the Conservative Group on 13 May 2022 and formed what they then called “The Southport Councillor Group”. In May 2023, Terry Jones did not seek re-election and Sinclair D'Albuquerque joined the Liberal Democrat Group. 

The Labour Party has held a majority of the seats on the Council since May 2012. Ian Maher, a Labour councillor, has been leader of the council since 2015. The next Council elections are due in May 2024.

Premises

The council meets at both Southport Town Hall and Bootle Town Hall, each of which was inherited from one of the council's predecessor authorities. Full council meetings are usually held alternately at Southport and Bootle.
