The Combat Support Group (CSG) is a component of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) established in 1998, initially known as the Operational Support Group (OSG). The primary objective of the CSG is to facilitate the coordination of military airbases and squadrons within Australia. While its initial focus was on general operations, its purpose has evolved to encompass a broader range of military applications, leading to the change in nomenclature.

At present, the CSG operates on a centralised control model, complemented by decentralised execution, enabling it to provide essential military airbase capabilities. The group collaborates with wings and squadrons situated across various locations within Australia, ensuring the provision of necessary support for Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations in the Asia-Pacific region.

Throughout its history, the CSG has actively participated in ADF operations, including deployments to regions such as the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The group has also played a pivotal role in offering Forward Control System (FCS) capabilities for Australian humanitarian missions.

Overall, the Combat Support Group contributes significantly to enhancing the operational effectiveness and support capabilities of the Royal Australian Air Force, reinforcing its commitment to regional security and national interests.
