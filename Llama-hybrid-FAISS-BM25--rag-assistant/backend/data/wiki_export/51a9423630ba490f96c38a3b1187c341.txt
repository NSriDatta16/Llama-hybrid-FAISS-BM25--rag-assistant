Haddenham & Thame Parkway railway station is a station in Buckinghamshire serving the village of Haddenham and town of Thame in the neighbouring county of Oxfordshire, England. The station is on the western edge of Haddenham, about  north east of Thame, and is served by Chiltern Railways.

History and general information
The historic Haddenham railway station and Thame railway station were on separate lines which closed in 1963. The old Haddenham station was on a different site about  south-east of the present one, and traces can still be seen where a bridge carries Station Road over the line.

The current station was opened on the Chiltern Main Line on 5 October 1987 to serve Haddenham and Thame. The British Rail station was built on the north side of Thame Road, Haddenham, and was originally single platform, with the platform sited on the former down line, long since removed. However, in 1998 as part of "Project Evergreen", Chiltern Railways re-doubled the Princes Risborough – Bicester line and re-modelled the platforms so that from 24 May 1998, there are now two, one on either line. Since then the platforms have also been lengthened and the station building has been expanded to include a coffee shop following the removal of the newsagents.

Renovations
In 2014/15, major renovations took place. A larger ticket hall was built and some platforms were extended. The plans were funded by Chiltern Railways, Network Rail, Buckinghamshire County Council and Sustrans and cost £500,000.
