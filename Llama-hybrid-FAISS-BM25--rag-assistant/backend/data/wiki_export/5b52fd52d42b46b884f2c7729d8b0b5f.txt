History
An electric tram service formerly ran down Crown Street from Oxford Street to Cleveland Street until its closure in the late 1950s. Until the opening of the Eastern Distributor in December 1999, Crown Street was a one way street in a southerly direction south of Campbell Street.

The now-closed Crown Street Women's Hospital was once the largest maternity hospital in Sydney. It opened in 1893, and was closed in 1983. The site has now been redeveloped as housing and mixed commercial use.

The Crown Street pumping station was established in 1859 to get water from the Botany Water Reserves, replacing Busby's Bore. It also pumped water up to the Paddington Reservoir, then the Centennial Park Reservoir before also supplying Waverley.
