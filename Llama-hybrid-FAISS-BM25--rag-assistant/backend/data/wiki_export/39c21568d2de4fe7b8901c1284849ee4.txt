Formation (2003)
At Expect The Unexpected on March 15, 2003, CM Punk began feuding with the debuting Raven over the former's straight edge lifestyle and the latter's alcohol and drug addiction, leading to Punk defeating Raven in a Raven's Rules match. The following week, at Night of Champions, Punk teamed with his trainer Ace Steel to take on Raven and Colt Cabana, another trainee of Steel and Punk's former tag team partner in the independent circuit. Raven and Cabana won the match but Cabana turned on Raven after the match and joined Punk and Steel to form a stable called The Second City Saints, based on the trio all belonging to Chicago, Illinois. This would plant the seeds of a lengthy violent feud between Punk and Raven throughout the year and the group would get embroiled in the feud.

At Retribution: Round Robin Challenge II, Punk introduced his on-screen girlfriend Lucy Fer as the trio's newest valet. Also, at the event, Steel and Cabana defeated Da Hit Squad in the latter team's last match as a tag team. At Do or Die, Punk and Cabana won a four-way Scramble match. The group's feud with Raven resumed at Night of the Grudges on June 14 when Raven returned to ROH after a three-month absence and teamed with B. J. Whitmer to take on Punk and Cabana in a no disqualification match, which Punk and Cabana won. At Wrestlerave '03, Punk and Cabana defeated the team of Christopher Daniels and Raven. Punk would then defeat Raven in a dog collar match at Death Before Dishonor. At Wrath of the Racket, Steel and Cabana defeated Alex Shelley and Jimmy Jacobs in a tag team match. After the event, Lucy was mysteriously attacked backstage by an unknown assailant while Punk was on a tour to Japan. After Punk's feud with Raven concluded in a steel cage match at The Conclusion, the Second City Saints began feuding with The Prophecy as Punk suspected Prophecy to be Lucy's assailants in order to maintain their spot as ROH's top group. This was in done in actuality to explain Lucy's departure from ROH.

The feud continued the following night at War of the Wire where Prophecy leader Christopher Daniels refused to provide any information on Lucy's disappearance which led to Punk attacking him. At Final Battle, Second City Saints attacked Prophecy and threatened to kill Allison Danger if Punk was not provided any information about Lucy's disappearance. Dan Maff swore on his father's grave that Prophecy was not behind the attack until Daniels revealed that B. J. Whitmer was the assailant which further fueled the feud between the two groups. Later at the event, Punk and Cabana defeated Turmeric Storm (Kazushi Miyamoto and Tomoaki Honma) in a tag team match.

Tag Team Champions (2004)
At The Battle Lines Are Drawn on January 10, 2004, Traci Brooks joined the Second City Saints as the group's newest valet. Later at the event, the Second City Saints took on The Prophecy's Christopher Daniels, B. J. Whitmer and Dan Maff in a six-man tag team match. After knocking out Whitmer and Maff, the Saints injured Daniels as Steel and Cabana assisted Punk in delivering a Pepsi Plunge to Daniels off the top rope onto a table. With Daniels' absence, the feud continued between Saints and Prophecy as Steel and Cabana took on Whitmer and Maff in a tag team match at At Our Best. The match ended in a no contest after a brawl broke out as Whitmer and Maff hit Steel and Cabana with chairs and severely injured them.
