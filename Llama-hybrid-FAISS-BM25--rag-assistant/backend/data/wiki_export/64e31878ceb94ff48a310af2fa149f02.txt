Readville was home to Camp Meigs during the American Civil War, a training camp for Union soldiers, including those of the famed 54th Massachusetts Infantry, portrayed in the film Glory. Another notable regiment that trained at Camp Meigs was the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, half of which was recruited in California and sent by sea to Readville for training before being sent to Virginia to the war. There are plaques and small monuments commemorating this history at what is now called Meigs Field. Also established in 1861 was Camp Massasoit.

The neighborhood was an Irish-American and Italian-American stronghold through much of the 20th century but is now home to many African-American and Hispanic and Latino residents.

Former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Massachusetts State Representative Angelo Scaccia are both longtime Readville residents.
