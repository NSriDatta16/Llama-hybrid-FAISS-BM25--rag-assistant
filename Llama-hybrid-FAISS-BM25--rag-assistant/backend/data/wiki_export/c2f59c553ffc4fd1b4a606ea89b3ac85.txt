Carrasco is a barrio (neighbourhood or district) in Montevideo, Uruguay. Located on the city's southeast coast, the barrio was originally an elegant seaside resort. However, it eventually became the city's most exclusive suburb. Carrasco is regarded as one of the most expensive barrios in Montevideo, and features a wide range of architectural styles.

Location
Carrasco borders Punta Gorda to the west, Carrasco Norte to the north, Canelones Department to the east and the coastline to the south.

Part of the seafront avenue along Carrasco is named Rambla Tomás Berreta and across it stretches the beach of Carrasco.

Its main street Alfredo Arocena, named after its founder, ends at the beach.

The Carrasco Creek separates this neighbourhood from Canelones Department.
