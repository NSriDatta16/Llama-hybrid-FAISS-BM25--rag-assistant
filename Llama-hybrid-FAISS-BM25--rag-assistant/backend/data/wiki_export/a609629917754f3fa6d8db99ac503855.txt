Tile Hill railway station is situated in the west of Tile Hill, Coventry, in the West Midlands of England. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Railway.

History
Tile Hill station was opened in 1850, and was originally known as Allesley Lane, until 1857 it was renamed to Allesley Gate, it assumed its current name of Tile Hill in 1864. The station was located at a point where the railway crossed the road on a level crossing. It originally had staggered platforms, with one platform on one side of the level crossing, and the other to the other side of the level crossing. The station was completely rebuilt when the line was electrified in the 1960's to its more present conventional form.

The level crossing adjacent to the station lasted until 2004, where a large bridge was built to carry road traffic over the railway and a footbridge built to connect the station platforms, Level crossings at Berkswell and Canley were also removed to upgrade the line for more high speed trains.

In 2009 the railway platform was extended, almost doubling the size.  This was the case for a number of stations along the route.

Historically this has been a busy railway station as many locals and non-resident locals used it as a park & ride, However, recently after the sale of the overflow car park to the developers there continues to be substantial parking issues at the station in and around the neighbouring roads.
