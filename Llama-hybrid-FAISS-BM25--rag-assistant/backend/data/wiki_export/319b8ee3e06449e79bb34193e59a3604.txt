Junior Kilat is a Filipino reggae, ska and dub band based in Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines. The name is taken from the 1970s Cebu band Leon Kilat, which the latter group claims, was first to sing about "Agta". They are a popular reggae band in Manila, winning a "Song Of The Year Award" in NU-107's Rock Awards for Ako Si M16, their first single from the album party pipol ur on dub tv.

The bandais composed of Errol "Budoy" Marabiles on vocals, Tiano Evangelista on bass, Archie Yba単ez on guitar, Bangin Atienza on turntable, Gina Pesta単o on keyboards, Cleofas Quijano on trombone and Diana Freese on drums. Former guitarist Jad Dapat  is now part of the Electronica/Dub group Kahibaloo and The Science Project, a Dubstep-Minimalist group, in Australia.

Albums
The group's first release was on the 2004 album Island Riddims which featured two of their tracks: K-Fyne and Original Sigbin. Both were performed live at The Baseline in Cebu City. Their second appearance was in the Island Krismas album with their track Kling Klang.

Their first album, party pipol ur on dub tv, was released in 2005. Some of the tracks in this album were studio-recorded, others performed live at Idiot Board, also in Cebu City.

Their second album was entitled Buwad Suka Sili and contains five tracks, two music videos and The Making of Ako Si M16 video. The video of K-Fyne is also included in the album. The lineup of Junior Kilat changed for this album. Jad Dapat, formerly the group's guitarist, left the band and Arcie Yba単ez took over his duties.

Currently, they have a new album, Enrique De Malacca. The carrier single of the said album is "1-2-3".

Errol "Budoy" Marabiles also joined Pinoy Big Brother Celebrity Edition, an ABS-CBN production.
