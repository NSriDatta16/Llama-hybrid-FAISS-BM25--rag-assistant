is an indoor sporting arena located in Namba, Osaka, Japan. It first opened in 1952 and the current building was constructed in 1987. It is the venue of a professional sumo tournament (honbasho) held in March every year. The capacity of the arena is 8,000 people. Its total revenue for the 2006 fiscal year was 260 million yen, of which sumo provided 80 million.

In March 2012, the arena was renamed  after the naming rights were sold to sports apparel company BB Sports for the next three years. The name was changed back in April 2015, when BB Sports did not renew their deal. In June 2015, EDION Corporation signed a three-year deal for the arena's naming rights, renaming it .

It has hosted several professional wrestling shows, including Osaka Hurricane from 2005 to 2012, NJPW Dominion from 2009 to 2014, NJPW Power Struggle since 2011, and The New Beginning in Osaka since 2012.

On October 12, 2019, the venue hosted the Rizin 19 mixed martial arts fight.

On February 22, 2023, the International Lethwei Federation Japan held a Lethwei event called Japan 15 - Kizuna at the venue.
