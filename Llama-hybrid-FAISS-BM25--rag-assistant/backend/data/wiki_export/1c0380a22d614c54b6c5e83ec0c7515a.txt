Gosiewski (plural form: Gosiewscy; feminine form: Gosiewska) is the surname of a Polish szlachta family whose members gained prominence in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania during the period of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

History
The Gosiewskis had roots in Łomża Land, and in the 15th–16th centuries owned properties in Mazovia and Podlachia.
It seems the Gosiewski family (or Gąsiewski in old times), originates from a Knight from the Ślepowron heraldic clan, Lord of Gosie or Gosiewo, near Różan. Their estate had an area of about 9 km², and contained villages: Modzele, Ogony, part of Młynarze (Mlynarze) village between the road and Narew River, part of Kruszewo village (south part of village and terrains up to Chełsty or Chelsty). Generally the estate contained quite big terrain from Chełsty to Różan. After they became also owner of a part of a village Mroczki-Kawki Many Gosiewskis still live in Chełsty and the surrounding area. Two of the most representative members of the family were Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski, Palatine-Governor of Smolensk, Speaker of the Parliament and commander of the Polish garrison of the Moscow Kremlin. His son Lithuanian Field Commander Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski was a supporter of a strong and centralized royal power, limiting Liberum veto and a variation about how the King should be elect call Vivente rege. They were two of the most powerful and influential officers in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the 17th century.

The family features on the list of legitimized nobility of Congress Poland.
