Rare (often referred to as Bowie Rare) is a compilation album by the English musician David Bowie, released by RCA Records in December 1982. The artist's relations with the company were at a low – Bowie had recorded his last music for RCA Records with the Baal EP, and had been annoyed by the release of a five-year-old duet with Bing Crosby ("Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy") as a single without his consultation. Bowie informed RCA he was unhappy with the Rare compilation, and would sign with EMI Records for his next album. All tracks on Rare  were being issued for the first time on LP and cassette.

The compilation contained rarities recorded between 1969 and 1980. RCA did not issue Rare in the United States; nor was the album reissued on CD along with most of Bowie's other RCA albums in 1984.

On the UK Albums Chart, where it remained for eleven weeks, the album peaked at number 34.
