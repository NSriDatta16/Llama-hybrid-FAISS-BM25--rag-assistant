Tannersville Station was a train station in Tannersville, New York operated by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad. It ceased operation in 1940 and was burned down on March 2, 1966.

History

The original station at Tannersvile, New York, branch MP 14.6, was architecturally similar to the Lanesville station; a small building with a platform on each end, was also torn down in 1899, after the Kaaterskill Railroad was standard-gauged by the U&D in 1899.

The new Tannersville station was a fabricated station made for the U&D in the early 1900s. This station had the typical frame of a U&D pre-fab station, but had three platforms; one on the left, one on the right, and another as an extension at the back of the station.

Tannersville was considered to be a successful year-round station, although branches of the U&D later became summer-only operations. 

Tannersville's terminal was still standing after U&D's branches were abandoned in 1939 and scrapped in 1940. The terminal was then purchased by the town of Hunter in order to function as town offices and a snowplow garage. 

The terminal was razed by a fire on March 2, 1966, along with three trucks and power equipment.
