History
Engineer Russ Morgan signed on the station for the first time on November 1, 1959 as WTTR-FM.

Shamrock Communications purchased the station on April 7, 1981 and changed the format to easy listening. The station's call sign was changed to WGRX in 1984, with a format change to "Eclectic Oriented Rock", a hybrid format created by Radio Consultant John Sebastian. The format changed to classic rock in May 1987.

WGRX changed its format to modern rock on December 2, 1994, branded as The X. In April 1996, the station fired its program director and six DJs, then aired a weekend-long stunt of disco music as "Polyester 101" before switching to a country music format on May 6, 1996, branded as "Froggy 100.7". The station later rebranded as "New Country 100.7".

On December 1, 1999, due to declining ratings, the station switched its call sign to WZBA, rebranded as 100.7 The Bay and changed formats to "Rock AC" (Rock Adult Contemporary), similar to WMMO in Orlando with the slogan "Rock Without the Hard Edge".

In 2001, WZBA relocated its transmitter closer to Baltimore.

The station changed its format to classic rock when WXFB changed formats from classic rock to smooth jazz on September 5, 2003.
