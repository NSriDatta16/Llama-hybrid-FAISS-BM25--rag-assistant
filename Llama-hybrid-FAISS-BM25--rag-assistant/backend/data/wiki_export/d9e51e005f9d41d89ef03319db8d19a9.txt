History
CareerBuilder was founded by Robert J. McGovern in 1995 under the name NetStart Inc. They originally sold software allowing companies to list job openings on their Web sites and to manage the incoming e-mails those listings created.

In 1996, Netstart raised $2 million in investment.

In 1998, NetStart Inc. changed its name to CareerBuilder and raised another $7 million in investment.

In 1999, the company's IPO raised $8 million more than initially forecasted, but was less successful than other Net offerings of the time. In its first day of trading, the stock opened at $17.50 and rose as high as $20 before closing at $16. Microsoft acquired a minority stake in the company in exchange for using the company's database on their own web portal.

In July 2000, the company was purchased in a joint venture by Knight Ridder and Tribune Company for $8 a share. CareerBuilder acquired competitors CareerPath.com and later Headhunter.net which had already acquired CareerMosaic. Even after the acquisitions, CareerBuilder still trailed behind top employment sites likeMonster.com and Hotjobs.com.

In 2001, major newspapers owned by Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company merged their help wanted sections with the online component.

In March 2002, Robert McGovern was replaced as CEO of the company by Robert Montgomery. Gannett purchased a one-third interest in the company for $98.3 million in 2002, adding the CareerBuilder brand to its 90 newspapers nationwide. The company suffered major difficulty because of the dot com crash and nearly went bankrupt.

The McClatchy Company purchased Knight Ridder for $4.5 billion in stock and cash in March 2006.

In December 2008, the company announced layoffs affecting approximately 300 employees.

In September 2012, the company acquired Economic Modeling Specialists Intl. (EMSI), an economic modeling software firm based in Moscow, Idaho. EMSI was sold to Strada Education Network in April 2018.

In 2016, CareerBuilder and Capella University launched the RightSkill program. The company also expanded into background screening with the acquisition of Aurico and post-hire software with the acquisition of WORKTERRA.

In June 2017, CareerBuilder was purchased by the private-equity firm Apollo Global Management and the Ontario Teachersâ€™ Pension Plan Board. In September of that year, CareerBuilder laid off 120 employees. Irina Novoselsky was appointed as CEO in October 2017, and in July 2021, was replaced as CEO by Sue Arthur from Optum.

Awards
In April 2006 CareerBuilder.com's site was nominated for a Webby Award in the employment category. In May 2019, CareerBuilder received a Bronze Stevie Award for the AI Resume Builder.

Consumer complaints 
According to two consumer complaints received by the office of Illinois Attorney General, Lisa Madigan, and reports from other states, scam artists have been contacting job hunters through CareerBuilder.com regarding a "Donations Handler" position with an international charity. The agreement is a classic pigeon drop. The "handler" accepts checks sent in the mail from Peachtree Corners, Georgia and is required to wire transfer the amount to an international account within 24 hours, but the checks are later discovered to be fraudulent. Victims reported losing between $500 and $2,000 in this scheme.
