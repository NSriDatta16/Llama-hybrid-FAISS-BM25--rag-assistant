Locally known as Airport Boulevard, State Road 750 (SR 750) is a  spur from Ninth Avenue in Pensacola to the entrance of Pensacola International Airport.  The western terminus is an intersection with Pensacola Boulevard (U.S. Route 29 or USÂ 29 and SR 95).

Since the state of Florida renumbered its Florida State Roads in 1945, a grid system of designation was imposed.  While Pensacola is in a region of Florida in which all three-digit State Roads should begin with a "1" or "2", its collection of State Roads has a few that begin with a "7" (usually used near Sarasota or Stuart, both over  away).
