Kosher style refers to foods commonly associated with Jewish cuisine but which may or may not actually be kosher. It is a stylistic designation rather than one based on the laws of kashrut. Generally, kosher-style food does not include meat from forbidden animals, such as pigs and shellfish, and does not contain both meat and milk in the same dish; however if such dish includes meat, it might not be kosher slaughtered. In some U.S. states, the use of this term in advertising is illegal as a misleading term under consumer protection laws.

Jews who do not keep kosher but wish to restrict themselves to eating "traditional style" foods, usually not eating forbidden animals or mixing milk and meat, may consider themselves to keep "kosher style".

History 
The term "kosher style" was invented by Nathan Handwerker, co-founder of Nathan's Famous. Because Nathan's lacked rabbinic supervision and the meat was not kosher, Handwerker advertised his all-beef hot dogs as "kosher style" because they were not made from pork or horse meat, both of which are considered treif.

Kashrut law 
Almost always, when a restaurant calls itself kosher style, the food is not actually kosher according to traditional halakhic (Jewish law) standards. The Reuben sandwich, which contains meat and cheese, is not kosher, nor is the Monte Cristo sandwich, made with ham and cheese. Dairy-based desserts such as cheesecake may be offered as complements to a meat dish. However, since fish is considered pareve (neither meat nor dairy), lox on a bagel spread with cream cheese may be kosher if the lox, cheese, bagel and all other ingredients meet the requirements of kashrut.

Jews who adhere strictly to the laws of kashrut will not eat at kosher-style establishments. Furthermore, the fact that such establishments appear to be kosher can be deceptive to Jews who are visiting an unfamiliar city and looking for kosher food. Some of these establishments are also open on the Jewish sabbath for business when this is forbidden by halakha. Others may choose to eat at but not consume meat or cheese at such restaurants.

Dining establishments 
Some dining establishments, notably delicatessens, serve kosher-style food. This usually means that they serve traditional Ashkenazic Jewish foods, such as chopped liver, bagels with cream cheese and lox, smoked sable, whitefish salad, gefilte fish, knishes, latkes, blintzes, cabbage rolls, egg cream, matzo ball soup, borscht, kasha varnishkes, stuffed derma, p'tcha, cholent, kugel, pickles, sauerkraut, and cold cut sandwiches, especially pastrami, corned beef, brisket and beef tongue. Some kosher-style delis also serve Sephardi and Mizrahi staples such as shawarma, falafel, hummus, Israeli salad, malawach, and shakshouka. 

Several notable restaurants in Lower Manhattan fit into the kosher-style genre, including Katz's Delicatessen and Russ & Daughters. Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, Manny's Deli in Chicago, and Schwartz's in Montréal also fall into this category.

In Toronto, several kosher-style restaurants (e.g., Meyers, Shopsy's) now serve pork products, such as bacon, ham, ribs, and sausage, in order to serve a larger number of customers. Some kosher-style hotdog restaurants, such as Max's Famous Hotdogs and The Windmill, use pork as well as beef hot dogs.

Differentiations in Practice 
“Kosher style” allows for variation in adherence to kashrut, reflecting different practices within the Jewish community. For some, kosher style implies abstinence from non-kosher animals, like pork and shellfish, and the avoidance of mixing meat and dairy in meals. These individuals may consume meat from animals that are kosher but not necessarily slaughtered according to kashrut standards.

The notion of “kosher style” serves individuals and communities navigating between strict religious observance and cultural identification with Jewish culinary traditions. Hasia Diner, a professor of American Jewish history at New York University, suggests that “kosher-style” represents a balancing act between tradition and assimilation, providing a sense of Jewish identity through food without strict adherence to kashrut.

This flexible practice emerged in the 1920s amongst Jews assimilating into American society, who sought connection to their heritage without fully observing dietary laws. The term is broad and encompasses foods that could be kosher, like chicken noodle soup or pareve meals (neither meat nor dairy), even if they don't meet halakhic standards. Diner points out the term is “oxymoronic,” creating an illusion of kashrut where the true emphasis is on a style of cuisine rather than compliance with religious dietary laws.

Over time, the meaning of "kosher style" has evolved and expanded, reflecting changes within Jewish communities and broader society. In contemporary practice, “kosher style” is often encountered at social events and gatherings, where meals might exclude certain non-kosher items but not adhere strictly to kashrut. The exact definition may vary between communities and individuals, reflecting diverse interpretations and practices related to Jewish dietary laws. The term also relates to products marketed as "kosher style," prompting some regions to establish legislation to clarify labeling and prevent consumer misunderstanding. For instance, kosher-style pickles might be produced without kosher certification or supervision but are associated with Jewish culinary tradition.

Criticism and Controversy
Critics of the “kosher style” designation argue it dilutes the significance of kashrut and misleads consumers regarding the food’s adherence to Jewish dietary laws. There is concern that the term blurs the line between what is genuinely kosher and what merely reflects a style of Jewish cuisine, potentially causing confusion amongst both practicing Jews and the broader public. As the kosher food industry expands and diversifies, incorporating various dietary trends and preferences, some believe that the concept of “kosher style” has become outdated and less meaningful, as it does not accurately represent the diversity and specificity of contemporary Jewish dietary practices and preferences.
