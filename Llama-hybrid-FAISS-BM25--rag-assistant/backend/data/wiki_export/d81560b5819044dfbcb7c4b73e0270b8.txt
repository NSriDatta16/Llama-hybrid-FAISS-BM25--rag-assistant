The Catholic University of the West (French: Université catholique de l'Ouest), also known as UCO or colloquially as la Catho, is a university located in Angers, France.

History 
Early in the 11th century, the precursor to the university became famous under the direction of Marbodus, later Bishop of Rennes, and of Ulger, later Bishop of Angers, both pupils of the renowned canonist, Fulbert de Chartres. I

t was enlarged in 1229 by an influx of students, many of them Englishmen, from the University of Paris, who sought in Angers a shelter from the direct control of the King of France. Angers then became a center for the study of civil law, and a "studium generale," although it was officially recognized as such by an Episcopal ordinance only in 1337. In 1364 it received from King Charles V a charter granting the same privileges as those enjoyed by the University of Orleans. It was only in 1432 that a papal bull of Pope Eugene IV added the usual colleges of Theology, Medicine and Arts to the College of Canon and Civil Law. This organization continued until the French Revolution.

After the National Assembly had granted to all freedom of teaching (July 1, 1875), the French bishops decided to found five Catholic universities, and Angers, thanks to Bishop Charles Émile Freppel, was chosen for the western portion of France, including the Dioceses of Angers, Rennes, Laval, Le Mans, Angoulême, Tours and Poitiers. The university then took the title of "Facultés Catholiques de l'Ouest." 

The University is regarded as one of the most prestigious private universities in France. The main campus is situated in a beautiful location in the city of Angers with more than 7,000 students. Catholic University of the West has international partnerships with more than 75 universities in the world. Starting from 2009, the university is trying to maintain international partnerships and agreements with more prestigious universities around the world.
