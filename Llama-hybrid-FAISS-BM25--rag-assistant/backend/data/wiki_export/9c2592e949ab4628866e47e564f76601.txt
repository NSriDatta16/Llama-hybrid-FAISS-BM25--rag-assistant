History
 For the World War II use of the airport, see Coffeyville Army Airfield

During World War II the facility was Coffeyville Army Airfield. It was a United States Army Air Forces AAF Flying Training Command training field from 1942 to 1945.

Aircraft used were Vultee BT-13A Valiants and BT-15s. The airfield performed Basic Pilot School instruction, the second phase of the three-phase training program for pilots. The facility was closed and turned over to civil authorities in 1947.

From 1951 to 1954 Ozark Airlines DC-3s between Tulsa and Kansas City stopped at Coffeyville; the airport was then called McGugin Field. National Air Transport's timetable showed a stop at Coffeyville in the 1930s, but that was an earlier airport.

In the 1950s Continental Can Company leased the hangars at the airport and was a subcontractor for Boeing Corporation, building bomb bay doors for B-52 Stratofortresses. This ended in 1958 with the completion of the B-52 contract. Coffeyville had been an industrious small city; this plant closing along with the closing of other industries was a severe blow to Coffeyville's financial health.

In its heyday Coffeyville had a dairy, Page Milk Company; an oilfield drilling rig company, Parkersburg; two railroad yards and maintenance operations, ATSF & Katy; a brick company and terra cotta roofing tile company, Ludowici-Celadon; a cast iron casting company; and a large oil refinery, Co-Op. On the northwest outskirts was a large smelter. Except for the oil refinery, which has a small operation today, all industries are gone.
