He started football at CUG Cluj before moving to Universitatea Cluj in 1993. The first two seasons at "U"'s first team were rather uneventful but then Soporan made 28 appearances and scored 9 goals in just one season for the Divizia B team. Winter 2006 saw him transferred to Politehnica Timişoara for the sum of 200.000 Euros where he was coached by Gheorghe Hagi.
