Biography

Early life
Stein was born and raised in Bayonne, New Jersey. He began playing piano at age four and later attempted the accordion. Upon being exposed to rock and roll in the 1950s, Stein settled on the guitar. He worked his way through various bands in his high school. While performing with one of these early groups, he spied an "old beat-up organ on the stage and started jamming on it."

Vanilla Fudge 
Stein and Tim Bogert had played in a local band called Rick Martin & The Showmen. The pair were so impressed by the swinging, organ-heavy sound of The Rascals they decided to form their own band in 1965. Originally calling themselves The Electric Pigeons, they soon shortened the name to The Pigeons.  Eventually, Carmine Appice and Vince Martell joined the band and they changed their name to Vanilla Fudge when they signed to Atlantic Records. The name change came because Atlantic didn't like the name The Pigeons. The origin of the name Vanilla Fudge came from a woman called Dee Dee, who worked at the Page 2 Club in Long Island, who stated her grandfather nicknamed her Vanilla Fudge. The bands debut was released in August 1967 and is a Gold Record. Their cover of The Supremes' You Keep Me Hangin' On is their most well known track. Vanilla Fudge are known for performing slow and heavier covers of fast and upbeat songs. Later hits include a cover of Junior Walker & The All Stars’ 1965 single Shotgun.

The band has been cited as; "one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal."

As of March 2023, Stein, Appice and Martell still continue to tour as Vanilla Fudge.

Solo
Mark was in the Tommy Cooper band from 1978 to 1979.

Mark published the autobiography, You Keep Me Hangin’ On in 2011. Stein released the solo album There's A Light was on November 26 2021. During the pandemic of 2020, Mark wrote, recorded and released the single “We Are One”, a reflection on the Black Lives Matter movement.

Influences
Stein himself influenced organist Jon Lord (1941-2012) of the band Deep Purple. Lord, in a 1989 interview said;  "[he] used to listen to Mark Stein of Vanilla Fudge in the late sixties. He was a useful source of tricks on the Hammond."
