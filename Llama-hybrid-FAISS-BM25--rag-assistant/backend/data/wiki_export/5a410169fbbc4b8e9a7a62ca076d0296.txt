Avrohom Elyashiv (c. 1877–1942) was the Av Beis Din (head of a rabbinical court) of the city of Gomel (Homel)

Biography
Avrohom Levinson (later Elyashiv) was the son-in-law of the kabbalist, Shlomo Elyashiv, author of the Leshem Shevo V’Achlamah. He was also the father of Yosef Shalom Eliashiv. He studied under the Chofetz Chaim, Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan in Raduń Yeshiva and later in Dvinsk.

In 1924, he immigrated to Jerusalem along with his father-in-law, his wife Chaya Musha, and young son Yosef Shalom. Following advice from Kagan, he changed his family name from Levinson to that of his father-in-law so the family would have a uniform immigration certificate.

Rabbinic career
In Jerusalem, Elyashiv was granted  semicha by Rabbi Avraham Isaac Kook.

Elyashiv founded and headed the yeshiva Tiferes Bochurim for working students, which was later headed by his son.

Elyashiv was the author of Bikkurei Avrohom.
