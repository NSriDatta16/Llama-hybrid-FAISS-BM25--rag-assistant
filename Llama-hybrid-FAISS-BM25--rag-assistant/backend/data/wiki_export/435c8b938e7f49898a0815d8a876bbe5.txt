The National Hockey League's Northeast Division was formed in 1993 as part of the Eastern Conference in a league realignment. Its predecessor was the Adams Division. The Northeast Division lasted for 19 seasons (not including the cancelled 2004–05 season) until the 2013 league realignment, when all five of its teams were placed into the new Atlantic Division.

Although none of its members won the Stanley Cup following the realignment until the Boston Bruins' title in 2011, its members accounted for a combined 43 Stanley Cup championships (24 by Montreal, 13 by Toronto and 6 by Boston), which was the most championships of any division in the NHL prior to 2013. In 2012, the Boston Bruins became the first team to win consecutive division titles.
