Trans-X is a Canadian 1980s synth-pop band formed in Montreal, Quebec. They are known for their hit song "Living on Video", which was a worldwide hit single.

History 
Trans-X was started by Canadian musician Pascal Languirand, previously known for his albums in the ambient, cosmic and space music genres. The name comes from the 1977 Kraftwerk song "Trans-Europe Express", which Languirand thought "was catchy and reflected well the direction I wanted to take with Trans-X". In 1982 he recruited Montreal keyboardist and programmer Steve Wyatt as the second half of the Trans-X duo. Together they recorded a demo that got Trans-X a recording contract for a single, "Vivre sur Vidéo".

Steve Wyatt played some synthesizer and did some programming on "Vivre sur Vidéo". He also composed "Digital World" and played all the instruments on the track, which was on the B-side of the single. "Digital World" can also be found on the maxi-single and on the band's debut album. Wyatt left Trans-X sometime in late 1983.

When "Living on Video" (the English version of "Vivre sur Vidéo") was released in May 1983, it was an instant hit in Canada  and the single later sold two million copies and reached British and European Top ten charts on its 1985 release.

Later in 1983, Trans-X released another song "Message on the Radio" which did not make it into the charts, and Trans-X ended the year with another single, "3D-Dance". All these songs featured on the band's 1983 debut album, Living on Video, known in Canada as Message on the Radio. For the studio recording of the album, Anne Brosseau was hired to do backing vocals. However, she decided not to perform with Trans-X. For this reason, Montrealer Laurie Ann Gill, who performed backing vocals for synthpop group Nudimension, was recruited for promotional pictures, TV performances and touring, which she did until 1985.

In 1986, the band released their second album, which had the same title and artwork as their debut album. Different versions were released in Canada and America and the album also contained three tracks from the 1983 album, although they were remixed or re-recorded.

In 1988, Languirand decided to retire Trans-X after their third album On My Own failed to chart outside of Canada. After the album was released Languirand went silent for a few years and decided to continue his solo career with new age, ambient and space music instead of electronica. Also, during this time, he and songwriter/collaborator Joe Caccamise wrote and produced for other artists and worked on new Trans-X material.

In 1994, Languirand returned as Trans-X, performing live with Nadia Sohaei. Later Languirand recorded a remake of his main hit under the title "Living on Video 2003" and released The Drag-Matic Album, produced by Michel Huygen of Neuronium. One more new version of this hit, "Living on Video 2k6" was released on 6 May 2006.

As of 2010, Languirand lived in Mexico. In early 2012, he was seen performing live with Truc Quynh, better known as "TQ", a relatively well-known Italo disco singer with whom Languirand had collaborated since at least 2004. However, on the 2010 single "I Want To Be With You Tonight", the L. O. V. 2011 album and on the 2012 Hi-NRG album that was released in Mexico, Languirand was vocally accompanied by Corina Lawrence, whom he worked together with from 2008 to 2015. In 2013, Languirand sang "My Fascination" with Truc Quynh; the song became part of TQ's later album Out of the Shadows which was released in late 2014. Although Languirand was involved in singing that song, it was more of a spin-off than a pure Trans-X project. Over the years, Languirand became more and more interconnected with other artists, especially after 1988, by not solely working for Trans-X, but being able to do other projects. Sometimes, he lent his voice to others, sometimes he worked for others as a producer, etc.

In 2012, Luis Broc joined the band as drummer and in 2014 he was joined by Ramón Serratos in SFX, synthesis and as a DJ of the band in live performances. Both are of Mexican origin. During 2016, the band made a series of tours in South America, reaffirming the taste for the Hi-NRG genre in diverse audiences, in the initiative of "Discolocos", a documentary film (co-written, directed and produced by David Dávila Herrera) that reflects the world of the followers of the genre since the 1980s. The film features Trans-X, who also created and sang the soundtrack (Discolocos, Vol. 1, released 2018), which has roots in classic themes from the 1980s in his tribute to the Hi-NRG and Italo disco genres, collaborating with the voices of Willie Chambers, Jessica Williams, Claudja Barry, Tobias Bernstrup, Stephan Groth, Cynthia Manley, Eskil Simonsson, Conrad Kaneshiro, Christina Criscione and J. D. Hall.

On 9 February 2021, Trans-X launched the album "Dreams Are Made of Fantasies" under the label Cleopatra Records. This album was produced by Ramón Serratos in Mérida, Yucatán Mexico.

On 11 November 2021, Trans-X releases the album "Psy Energy" under the label Skypark Records, also produced by Ramon Serratos.
