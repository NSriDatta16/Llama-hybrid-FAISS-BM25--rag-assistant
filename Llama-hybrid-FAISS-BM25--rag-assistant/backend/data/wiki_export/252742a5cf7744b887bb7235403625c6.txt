History
On May 21, 1869, Winterset bought  of land from Washington Cassidy and R. A. Sitt for $57.50.  of land was bought from C. D. Bevington and J. J. Hutchings for $2,000 on October 15, 1872. The final  of what was to be Winterset City Park years later was bought on September 17, 1825, from Henry Smith for $200. The acres of land was originally used for grazing cattle until the 1950s when the city was deciding on selling the land. The citizens disagreed and some of the women in Winterset gained permission from the city government to raise money to preserve the land as a place for leisure. The women were successful and the city decided to not sell the land. A. W. Crawford, who lived in Winterset, donated $25,000 in 1917 towards park renovation. Part of the money was used to buy  and miles of road through the park was created.

Clark Tower is located in the park. The tower was built from 1926 to 1927 to stand as a memorial for Caleb and Ruth Clanton Clark, one of the original pioneer families that settled in Madison County. It was built by the couple's descendants. The limestone tower is  wide and  high. A short distance from Clark Tower is a stone house's ruins, where it is claimed that Frank and Jesse James slept one night. It is also rumored that the house is haunted.

Around 1918, a descendant of one of the pioneer families donated $20,000 for the construction of a shelter house. The shelter house was not built until 1957 and it cost $28,000 to construct the house out of limestone. Another limestone building was built in 1961 to store park equipment and restrooms. Winterset City Park also has a log cabin that contains two rooms. To the north of the cabin, there is a six-ton granite boulder that commemorates the discovery of the Red Delicious apple in Madison County in 1872. The boulder was erected in 1922.
