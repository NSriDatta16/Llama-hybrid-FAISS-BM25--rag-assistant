Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.

History

Weirbach family
Weyerbacher Brewing was founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirbach originally operating out of a repurposed livery stable in downtown Easton. Their beer quickly grew in popularity, and in the mid-2010's they underwent a costly expansion, moving out of their original location to a new 30,000 sqft brewery. In 2018 Weyerbacher's original brewmaster, Chris Wilson, left for another position at Free Will Brewing. Additionally, in 2018 Weyerbacher partnered with White Castle to become their exclusive beer partner, putting their beer on draft in over 400 locations, until bankruptcy in 2019. During their expansion, the craft beer market became saturated and their sales dropped off quickly resulting in Weyerbach having $2.1 million in debt and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2019. 

Going into the first bankruptcy a Philadelphia based investment firm, 1518 Holdings, was set to purchase a 55% majority stake in the brewery. However, they abandoned these plans and the interim leadership group led by Josh Lampe had to work through the bankruptcy on their own, and ultimately emerged and resumed production, albeit with a much smaller slate of products. Weyerbach opened a second tap house in New Hope in an effort to increase their on-site sales. However, the debts and restructuring from the transfer hampered production, and quickly another $1.5 million of debt was amassed. Chapter 11 bankruptcy was again declared in July 2022 as production was unable to return to pre-2019 levels.

Savant Beverages
Following their second bankruptcy, Weyerbacher was purchased by Savant Beverages LLC, owned by Edwin Lozano, a former executive at the Miller Brewing Company and a resident of Palmer Township. Lozano purchased the company in part due to their brand-recognition as one of the pioneering craft beer producers in Pennsylvania, and the first in the Lehigh Valley.

The new ownership group entered a partnership with the Colony Meadery to share their large brewery to also produce their mead. Lozano is a friend of one of Colony Meadery's co-founders, Greg Heller-LaBelle, who used to run a craft-beer blog and was one of the more respected figures in the Lehigh Valley beer scene before transitioning to mead in 2012. Additionally, the new ownership group has broken with the old tradition of the brewery and began serving food in-house, although produced and catered by the nearby Marquee Kitchen.

After opening their tap-room with limited hours in December 2022, Weyerbacher had a grand reopening in late January 2023. The company hosts a 5K run, the Weyerbacher Hill Challenge, where participants are gifted two free beers for signing up. The comapany has also increased their participation in local brewing events in the Lehigh Valley with other brewers.
