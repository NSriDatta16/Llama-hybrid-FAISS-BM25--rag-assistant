Jacques Ploncard (13 March 1910 – 20 February 2005), also called "Jacques Ploncard d'Assac", was a French writer and journalist and a political activist – he was, among other things, a member of the Parti Populaire Français. Following the fall of the Vichy regime, he escaped to Portugal's Estado Novo in 1945, where he counselled Salazar. He introduced Yves Guérin-Sérac, one of the co-founders of the OAS, to the PIDE. After the April 1974 Carnation Revolution, he returned to France and collaborated on Présent, a newspaper which maintained loose links with Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front. Jacques Ploncard also wrote Doctrines of Nationalism.
