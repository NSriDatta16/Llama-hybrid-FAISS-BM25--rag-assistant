Mill Bay is a commuter town of about 7,200 people located on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada about  north of Victoria, the capital. It is part of the Cowichan Valley Regional District.

Mill Bay was founded in the 1860s with lumber and milling as its primary industries, done at the mill on the bay. It was named for the sawmill built in the area in 1861 by Henry S. Shepherd soon purchased by William Sayward.    It is known for its ferry to Brentwood Bay on the Saanich Peninsula and the historic Malahat Drive, which is also a source of criticism due to frequent closures from either automobile accidents or weather conditions.  Numerous suggestions have been made by various groups regarding a 'bypass' route (possibly a bridge), though as of 2007, the Brentwood-Mill Bay Ferry and the Malahat remain the best routes to Greater Victoria from the rest of Vancouver Island (a third route goes south from Lake Cowichan via Port Renfrew to Victoria).  The MV Mill Bay that has served the ferry route since 1956 is named for the town but was taken out of service in 2011 and is now served by the MV Klitsa.
