The original school building with 18 classrooms was constructed on a site covering  at a cost of $1.7 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Prior to opening, students from Berlin Borough attended Edgewood Regional High School, while those from Gibbsboro and Voorhees Township were sent to either Collingswood High School or Haddonfield Memorial High School.

The school opened in 1965, with 35 professional staff and 525 students in grades 9-11 in a building designed to accommodate enrollment of 850. The school was originally divided into schools on the same site: Eastern Intermediate High School (grades 9-10), completed in 1992, and Eastern Senior High School (grades 11-12). There were over 1,000 students enrolled  at Eastern Senior High School. Eastern Intermediate High School had approximately 1,150 enrolled students. In September 2012, the schools merged into one unit with the retirement of Dr. James Talarico in June 2012 and was renamed "Eastern Regional High School" with Robert Tull serving as the principal of the merged school. The oldest parts of the school, which were constructed in 1965, 1970, and 1975 are now the "11-12 Building", and the 1992 addition is referred to as the "9-10 Building".

In 2021, the school and its principal were accused of attempting to censor the valedictorian's speech during the graduation ceremony. Bryce Dershem, the valedictorian, gave a speech that included him being queer and overcoming mental health issues, but the principal, Robert Tull, tried to make him recite a preapproved speech that excluded those remarks.
