Kew, New South Wales is a small town in the Mid North Coast region of New South Wales, Australia in the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council local government area. Kew is one of the communities that make up the Camden Haven district of Port Macquarie-Hastings.

Kew is located at the intersection of Nancy Bird Walton Drive (the former Pacific Highway) and Ocean Drive, the road to the larger town of Laurieton. Kew has a visitor information centre,
a pub, a post office, a small police station, a motel, a roadhouse and a general store. Traffic congestion along this stretch of the highway led to the construction of a new dual carriageway bypass of Kew to the east of the township as part of a highway upgrade from Coopernook to Herons Creek. Construction commenced in November 2007 and was completed in December 2009.

The largest school in the district, Camden Haven High School, is located 2 km east of Kew on Ocean Drive.
