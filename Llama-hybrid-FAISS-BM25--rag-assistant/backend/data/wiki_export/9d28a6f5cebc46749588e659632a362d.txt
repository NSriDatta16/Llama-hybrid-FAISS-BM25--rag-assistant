Fritz Kraemer (12 December 1900 – 23 June 1959) was a high-ranking Waffen-SS commander and war criminal during the Nazi era. During World War II, Kraemer initially served with the 13th Infantry Division. In January 1943, he was appointed as a staff officer of the I SS Panzer Corps commanded by Sepp Dietrich. Kraemer was admitted into the SS on 1 August 1944.  During the battles in Normandy, Krämer acted as Dietrich’s deputy, and eventually succeeded Hubert Meyer as commander of the SS Division Hitlerjugend. He was in charge of the division until 13 November 1944.

Kraemer later served as a chief of staff with the 6th Panzer Army and surrendered to the U.S. Army, along with Dietrich, in May 1945. He was tried in 1946 for his role in the Malmedy Massacre. He was found guilty of war crimes for his role in the drafting and transmission of illegal orders. The orders, which were authorized by Dietrich, directed that prisoners of war could be shot "if necessary, in very compelling situations". Kraemer was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released in 1952, and died in 1959.
