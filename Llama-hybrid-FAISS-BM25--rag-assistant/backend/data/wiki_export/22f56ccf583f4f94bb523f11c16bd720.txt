Covers and Uses

 The unreleased song "Shatter Me", co-written by Alexz Johnson, is the only Jude Harrison song in canon that is not performed on screen by Johnson. Just as she is about to perform the song as a duet in-show, she refuses and walks offstage. Thus, leaving her  Instant Star  runner-up and rival Eden Taylor, portrayed by Katrina Matthews, to commit career suicide by performing her unaltered live vocals alone. The studio radio single version by Jude Harrison (Johnson), is only briefly heard in the background of one scene with heavy voice-overs. Before the demo leaked online after many years, the only clear and concrete sample of the song available to the public was a 30 second clip heard in a behind the scenes blooper that was included in the bonus features of the first season DVD boxset. 
 Also included in the DVD boxset blooper reel is a tiny a cappella clip of Johnson jokingly singing a line from "Frozen" in between takes on set.
