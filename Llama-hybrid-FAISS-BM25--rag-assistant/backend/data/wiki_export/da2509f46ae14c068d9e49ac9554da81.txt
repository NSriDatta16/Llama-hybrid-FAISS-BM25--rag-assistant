The Revised Statutes of Canada (R.S.C. or RSC) consolidates current federal laws in force, incorporating amendments into acts, adding new substantive acts enacted since the last revision and deleting rescinded acts. Supplements to the RSC contain new or amended statutes, while consolidations republish laws for convenience without changing their legal effect. The Statutes of Canada (SC) are the compilation of all the laws passed by the Parliament.

History 
There have been six revisions: in 1886, 1906, 1927, 1952, 1970, and 1985.

Publication 
The Publication of Statutes Act does not apply to the Revised Statutes.
