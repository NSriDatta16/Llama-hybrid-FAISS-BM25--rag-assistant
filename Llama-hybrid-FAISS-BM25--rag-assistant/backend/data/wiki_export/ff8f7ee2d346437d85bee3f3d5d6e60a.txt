History
After an initial period during which barter prevailed, the French  began to circulate. In order to encourage coins into the colony, those circulating in New France were valued at a premium, creating a  (French  in Modern French) worth less than the French currency (,  in Modern French). The premium was set at one-eighth in 1664, raised to one-third in 1680. The New France currency was distinguished by the extensive use of paper money. However, early issues did not maintain their value. In 1717, the premium for coins was abolished, the card money was redeemed at half its face value and the New France  was set equal to the French . Further paper money was issued. In the 1750s, the backing of paper money by coins was discontinued, causing the hoarding of coins. Following the British conquest of New France, the paper money lost its value and the  was replaced by the pound.

Banknotes
In 1685, "card money" was introduced. These were simple notes, hand written on the back of playing cards, which were used due to a shortage of coins.   The first issue was redeemed after 3 months. Despite the French authorities' displeasure, further issues were made into the 1690s. Inflation reduced the card money's value, until it was redeemed at half face value in 1717.

In the 1720s, the government introduced promissory notes, known as .  Card money was reintroduced in 1729. Denominations of 6, 12 and 24  were issued in 1729, followed by 30  in 1733, 20  in 1734, 3  in 1742, and  and 15  in 1749.
