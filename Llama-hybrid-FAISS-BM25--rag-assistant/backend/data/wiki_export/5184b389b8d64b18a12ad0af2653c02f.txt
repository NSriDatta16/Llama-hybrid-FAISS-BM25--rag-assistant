Name
Avlonas (Greek: Αυλώνας) is often called Avlona (Αυλώνα), however the masculine Avlonas should be used rather than the feminine Avlona. The ancient Greek Avlon (Αυλών) is also masculine. It appears that the name Αvlon is connected with the worship of Dionysus according to an ancient slab that was found in the area, dedicated to Διονύσῳ Αὐλωνεῖ (Dionysos of Avlon).

Historical population

Avlonas has historically been an Arvanite settlement.
