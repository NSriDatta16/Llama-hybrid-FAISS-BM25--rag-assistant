T-slot structural framing is a framing system consisting of lengths of square or rectangular extruded aluminium, typically 6105-T5 aluminium alloy, with a T-slot down the centerline of one or more sides.

It is also known under several generic names, such as aluminium extrusion, aluminium profile and 2020 extrusion if the cross-section is 20x20 mm, alongside brand names, such as 80/20 framing.

While the precise history of the T-slot framing system is not known, advancement in extrusion press technology in the early 1950s allowed for economic production of aluminium profiles, and examples of use can be found from the early 1960s.

Although no published standard defines the system, it is produced in a series of conventional sizes which allows for compatibility between manufacturers.

There is a variation on T-slot profiles known as V-slot rails where V-slot wheels are slotted into the V-shaped channels of the framing for linear motion in a 3D printer or other CNC machine.

Profiles
T-slot framing is divided into metric and fractional (imperial) categories. The T-slot is always centered along the long-axis of the piece. Pieces are available in each series with a square cross-section. Rectangular cross sections are also available which measure x by 2x (where x is the defined width) - e.g. 40mm by 80mm for 40 series.
