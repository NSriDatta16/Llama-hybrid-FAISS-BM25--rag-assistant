Leitrim (), is a small village in County Down, Northern Ireland, approximately 6 miles from Castlewellan, near Dromara. It is set between the Dromara Hills (Slieve Croob) and the Mourne Mountains. It is claimed to be home to the MacCartan clan of Kinelarty. 

Within the centre of Leitrim village there is a Catholic Church,  a  shop and a  bar. Along the Backaderry road there is also a pre-school,  an animal feed factory and the local Gaelic club.

Leitrim’s Gaelic club (Liatroim Fontenoys GAC) is disputed to be the oldest in Down – being founded in 1888. Leitrim has developed friendly rivalrys with Kilcoo GAC and Castlewellan GAC. Most years Leitrim will hold a festival in and around the club grounds.

Although there is only one village named Leitrim in south down, near Hilltown there is a small forest area and camping site named Leitrim lodge.
