Stafford was born in Oakland, California. He attended Reed College and graduated from the University of Washington.

In 1961, while at Reed College, Stafford experimented with the Native American sacred cactus Peyote. He moved to the East Village in New York City in 1964, where he spent the next ten years.

He was the editor of Crawdaddy! magazine from 1969 to 1970. He was a contributor to High Times.

In 1974, Stafford moved to Santa Cruz, California, with the intention of reconnecting with his father, whom he had not seen since early childhood.
