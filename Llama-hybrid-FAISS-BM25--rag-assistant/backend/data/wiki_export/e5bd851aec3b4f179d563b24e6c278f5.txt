Kind of Like Spitting is an American indie rock band. They formed in 1996 in Portland, Oregon. The band is led by singer-songwriter Ben Barnett, whose work has drawn comparisons to Elliott Smith, Mark Eitzel, Billy Bragg, and Robert Pollard.

Over the next decade, Kind of Like Spitting regularly toured in the US, sometimes with David Jerkovich of Novi Split or a backing band. Kind of Like Spitting released twelve albums in seven years. In the UK, the track "Birds of a Feather" was picked up and played by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, but didn't get regular airplay. The band announced a break-up in 2006 for personal reasons.

History
In July 1998 the band released a self-titled EP through Hush Records. In April 2000 You Secretly Want Me Dead was released.

Barnett has been involved in other musical projects, including The Thermals in 2002–2003. Since 2007, Barnett has taught music at the Paul Green School of Rock in Seattle. Barnett was also part of the band Blunt Mechanic, which released the album World Record in 2010.

In 2014, Kind of Like Spitting reunited again but as a trio with Brian Grant on bass guitar and Dante Johnson on drums. In this lineup the band recorded their Topshelf Records debut, It's Always Nice To See You and embarked on a two-week-long tour with Lemuria.
