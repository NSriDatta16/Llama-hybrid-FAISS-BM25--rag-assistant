TER Basse-Normandie was the regional rail network serving Lower Normandy, France. In 2016, it was merged into the new TER Normandie. Its network was articulated around the city of Caen.

Trains are operated by the SNCF, services are subject to regulation by the Conseil Régional de Basse Normandie and are promoted using the TER branding. The Conseil Régional has since 2001 received several new multiple diesel-electric units, including single coach, double coach and refurbishment of three car DMUs.
