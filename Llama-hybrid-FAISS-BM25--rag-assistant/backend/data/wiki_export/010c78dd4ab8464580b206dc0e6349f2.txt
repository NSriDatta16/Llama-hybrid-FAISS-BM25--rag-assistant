Paul Youll (born 1965 in Hartlepool, England) is a science fiction and fantasy artist and illustrator. He was born as one of five sons and, at one time, was part of a two-man illustration team with his twin brother, Stephen. He got his start in the genre when his work, done in conjunction with Stephen's, was seen in 1987 at the 45th World Science Fiction Convention in Brighton, England.  His first commission, a collaboration with Stephen, was for the cover painting for Emerald Eyes by Daniel Keys Moran that was published by Bantam Books.

After graduating from the Durham New College of Art and Design, Paul spent two more years at Sunderland University.  Since 1989, when Stephen moved to America, Paul has worked independently and has produced paintings mainly for Bantam Books.  Youll currently resides with his wife Annmarie in the country village of Esh Winning, on the border of Derwent Side and County Durham.  He illustrates primarily for the U.S. softcover (paperback) book market.
