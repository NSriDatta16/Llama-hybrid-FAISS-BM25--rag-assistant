Flynn had already played in Scotstoun with Toulouse and stated: "When I played at Scotstoun last season, the atmosphere was fantastic and it shows the club has a really good support base. I jumped at the chance to join the Warriors after chatting to Gregor and I'm good friends with Scotland full-back Sean Maitland and he couldn't say enough good things about Glasgow."

On 26 May 2017 it was announced that Flynn was no longer contracted by the Warriors.

Flynn made his international debut for the All Blacks against Canada after a surprise selection ahead of Anton Oliver in the 2003 Rugby World Cup.

After rugby 
He returned in 2021/22 for season 2 of Match Fit.
