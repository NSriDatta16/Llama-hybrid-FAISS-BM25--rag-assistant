Chichester High School for Boys, or CHSB, was a boys' secondary school with academy status, located in the city of Chichester, West Sussex, England. It was formed in 1971 during the schools reformation act of the 1970s by the amalgamation of two established schools; The Lancastrian School (established 1895) and the High School for Boys (established 1929). In 2016, Chichester High School for Boys merged with Chichester High School for Girls, to become just Chichester High School. This occurred after speculation that the two schools would merge, starting from 2014. The new school would adopt purple as its main colour, replacing the previous boys' school green and girls' school navy.

History

Early history (1929–1971) 
The Chichester High School for Boys was founded in 1929.

During World War II, children were evacuated from large cities to protect them from The Blitz. Pupils from the Henry Thornton School in London attended Chichester High School for Boys from October 1939 to July 1943. The school had a rule that if the air raid siren sounded before 5 pm there would be no homework that day.

Amalgamation with the Lancastrian School (1971–2013) 
The Chichester High School for Boys and the Lancastrian School for Boys were amalgamated in 1971. The sister schools of the Chichester High School for Girls and the Lancastrian School for Girls were also amalgamated at the same time.

Academy status (2013–2016) 
The Chichester High School for Boys converted to Academy status on 1 September 2013 and was taken over by The Kemnal Academies Trust (TKAT).

In July 2015, Ofsted conducted a full inspection and gave the school a 'Requires Improvement' rating.

In September 2016, the Chichester High School for Boys and the Chichester High School for Girls were amalgamated into the Chichester High School.

Uniform 
The Boys and Girls High Schools have merged, so the uniform has changed as of 2016. Since the boys' and girls' schools merged in 2016 purple blazers are worn, along with purple ties, with stripes of each house colour.
