is Gundam SEED Destiny counterpart to Gundam SEED: Special Edition. It is a four-part compilation movie.

Overview

Like the three specials of Gundam SEED, these specials feature new or changed scenes of the TV series. However unlike the TV series, which was told in the points of view of main characters Shinn Asuka and Kira Yamato, the Special Edition was told through the eyes of Athrun Zala, giving the movies a much more neutral point of view.
The DVD quartet, as opposed to the series, seems to put much more emphasis on Shinn's romantic relationship with Lunamaria Hawke and much less emphasis on Lunamaria's prior crush on Athrun so that fans could see a much easier transition from Shinn being romantically involved with Stella Loussier to Lunamaria, rather than in the series, which just had it as a sudden occurrence.
