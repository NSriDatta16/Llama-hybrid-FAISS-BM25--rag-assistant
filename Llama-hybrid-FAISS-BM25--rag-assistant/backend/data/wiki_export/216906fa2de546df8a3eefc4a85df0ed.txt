Blue is the fifth and final release from Flashlight Brown. The album was intended to be their second release from Hollywood Records but weeks before the release of the album, the band left the label for "extreme differences of opinion". The release of the album was then delayed indefinitely.

On October 30, 2006, the band posted on their MySpace account that they would release the album the next day, Halloween, in Canada. Two of the songs, "Sicker" and "I'm A Human" were performed for MTV in early 2007, and shortly after, the band split. "I'm A Human" was later featured in the series Smallville.

Although the album was only released physically in Canada and Japan, it has been made available to stream worldwide through music streaming services years after its release.

Reception

In a generally favourable review, Chart Attack magazine wrote, "It's the kind of pop-rock that isn't merely catchy, it's rewarding after repeated listens." Exclaim!s review was more negative, saying, "While the energy and enthusiasm put forth on tracks such as "Sicker", "Get Out Of My Car" and "Party By Myself" is admirable, there’s a distinct stench of immaturity here that detracts from the overall product."
