Greatford is a village and civil parish in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated  west from the A15,  north-east from Stamford, and  south from Bourne. Greatford is noted for Greatford Hall, once the home of Francis Willis.

In the 2001 Census, Greatford's population was found to be 260, increasing slightly to 268 at the 2011 census.

History
There are different pronunciations and spellings for this village's name, including Greatford, Gritford, and Gretford. The name could be derived from its location on a gravel or 'grit' ford of the West Glen River.

Greatford is listed in the 1086 Domesday book as "Greteford" and "Griteford",

The parish contains the now untraceable medieval hamlet of Banthorp, mentioned in Domesday. A 1334 tax list puts the site of Banthorp to the west of Greatford at Banthorpe Woods and Lodge.

In October 1892 a granary full of barley collapsed at the farm of the Dean family, killing four people: two from Greatford, one from Langtoft and one from Market Deeping.

Landmarks
Greatford Grade I listed church, built in Early English style, dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury. It is part of the Uffington Group of the Deanery of Aveland & Ness with Stamford.  The incumbent is The Rev'd Carolyn Kennedy. The church was previously part of the Greatford with Wilsthorpe Group.

Greatford Hall was originally a manor house built by Queen Elizabeth I in the 16th century. It was the home and private asylum for Francis Willis, the physician who treated and 'cured' King George III of his 'madness' here in 1788. In 1922 the hall burned down and was subsequently rebuilt in a similar style to the original. There is no public access to the hall today.

During the Second World War the Hall was owned by Lancaster Gate Hotels. In the 20th century Greatford Hall was the residence of the businessman Harry Dowsett who, in 1943, formed the civil engineering company Dow-Mac that first developed the use of prestressed concrete, made at Tallington  to the south of Greatford. The company is now Tarmac Precast Concrete. In 1940 Dowsett bought the Lowestoft-based firm of shipbuilders, Brooke Marine that made Royal Navy landing craft during the Second World War.

The village public house is the Hare and Hounds on Village Street.

Geography
To the west, the parish boundary meets Braceborough and Wilsthorpe to the north, passing through Banthorpe Lodge, crossing the East Coast Main Line, then following the West Glen River through Shillingthorpe Park. Close to the village near Greatford Hall, the boundary passes north, crossing the road to Carlby. It follows part of the Macmillan Way (which passes straight through the parish, broadly following the Glen) near some coppices. It rejoins the West Glen River, crossing the road to Wilsthorpe. East of Fletland Mill, it meets Thurlby (Obthorpe).

At the A15 bridge over the West Glen River, where the Macmillan Way crosses, it meets Baston, to the east. The boundary now follows the Roman road King Street, and the King Street Drain, to the south. For 200 metres it meets Langtoft, then meets Barholm and Stowe, and leaves King Street to the west, passing through some coppices. north of Barholm, it briefly follows the Greatford Cut, a navigation built in 1954 to connect the West Glen River, to the north at Greatford, with the River Welland west of Market Deeping, and to stop the River Glen from flooding. It passes north of Maidens' Farm and at the East Coast Main Line meets Uffington, passing along the southern edge of Browne's Oaks.

The highest part of the parish is just above the 20m contour in the North west.  The village and the remaining farmland is rather lower, perhaps less than 15m. (there is a 12m spot height for the village itself on the OS map)

The underlying geology of the parish is Sedimentary: to the South and East is of a Kellaways sand and siltstone.mix, and to the North and West a Kellaways clay deposit where the land rises at the western edge of the Parish.  The whole is overlaid with Quaternary 'river terrace' sands and gravels dating back 1 or 2 million years.  Unlike Tallington to the south, there has been no extraction of these deposits in Greatford. From the south west to the Northwest the west Glen river lies in a shallow valley, its floodplain formed of its own alluvium of clay and silt.
