On the 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea, Walters made his test match debut; he and Kerrod became the first twin brothers to play rugby league for Australia.

Walters played in the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand that saw Australia retain The Ashes. Later that year, he was part of the Brisbane roster that won the 1992 Grand Final 28–8 against the St George Dragons at Sydney Football Stadium. Steve, Kevin and Kerrod Walters had already become the first trio of brothers to play for Queensland and Australia in 1992, and another milestone was achieved when all three were selected to tour in England with the Australian Rugby League World Cup squad.

In 2001, Walters played four games for the Warrington Wolves in the English Super League.

In 2003, Walters was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. In 2007, Walters was included in a club list of their best twenty best players to date.

Coaching career
Following retirement as a player, Walters started his coaching career with the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the Queensland Cup regional competition as head coach (2001-2003), then the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL as assistant coach (2003-2005, 2015, 2018) and the Queensland Maroons in the State of Origin series as assistant coach (2006-2008, 2014-2015). Each of Walters' stints (2003-2005, 2015, 2018) as an assistant coach at Brisbane was under head coach Wayne Bennett. At the end of the 2005 season, after five successive years without a grand final appearance, Bennett decided to clean-out the coaching staff and removed long-time allies such as Walters, Gary Belcher and Glenn Lazarus. Walters then became head coach of the Ipswich Jets (2007-2008) in the Queensland Cup competition before securing a coaching contract in the English Super League with the France-based Catalans Dragons.

Catalans Dragons (2009-2010)
In 2009, Walters was appointed as the head coach of the Catalans Dragons. The team reached the qualifying semi-final for the Super League Grand Final and finished eighth in the competition after sixteen wins and sixteen losses during the Catalans Dragons 2009 season. In the 2010 season, the Dragons finished fourteenth (last) after six wins and twenty-one losses.

Returning to Australia, Walters was going to coach the Easts Tigers in the Queensland Cup in 2011, but instead joined the Melbourne Storm as an NRL assistant coach under Craig Bellamy, where he remained until the end of the 2013 NRL season. After Melbourne, Walters was appointed in 2014 as the halves' coach for the Newcastle Knights under Wayne Bennett.

Queensland Maroons (2016-2019)
In December 2015, Walters was appointed as head coach of the Queensland State of Origin team after Mal Meninga had to resign on becoming the Australian national rugby league team coach. 
In both 2016 and 2017, the Maroons achieved a 2–1 series victory over New South Wales. In the 2018 series, New South Wales won 2–1. In the 2019 State of Origin series, Queensland won the first game but suffered a 38–6 loss at Optus Stadium in the second game. In game 3, Queensland lost in the final twenty seconds after New South Wales scored a length of the field try. In September 2020, Walters resigned as the Maroons' head coach after being appointed head coach of the Brisbane Broncos.

Brisbane Broncos (2021-present)
In the 2021 NRL season, Walters made his debut as an NRL head coach. His first victory as such was in round 3 when the Brisbane Broncos defeated the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 24-0 at Suncorp Stadium. By the end of 2021, Brisbane had won a total of seven matches and lost seventeen. They did not qualify for the finals and finished fourteenth on the NRL ladder. In 2022, former South Sydney Rabbitohs captain and prolific football-kicker Adam Reynolds joined Brisbane as  and team captain. They won a total of thirteen matches and lost eleven, but missed out on the finals again, finishing ninth.

Brisbane started 2023 with five consecutive wins, including the Battle for Brisbane 18-12 victory on 24 March at Suncorp Stadium against the Dolphins - coached by Walters' former mentor Wayne Bennett - in their inaugural NRL season. Brisbane extended Walters' contract until the end of the 2025 season. At the end of round 10, Brisbane was on top of the 2023 league ladder; however, that changed the following week. By round 25, Brisbane was back in first position and needed to defeat the Melbourne Storm to secure the minor premiership, but a decision to rest eleven of thirteen regular players that match contributed significantly to Brisbane finishing second (two weeks later) on the 2023 ladder after the Penrith Panthers, the minor and major premiers from 2022. Nevertheless, Brisbane went on to qualify for their first grand final in eight years. In the 2023 NRL Grand Final at Accor Stadium against the Penrith Panthers, Brisbane trailed 6-8 at half-time. In the second half, they scored three quick tries to lead 24-8. During the last twenty minutes, Penrith made the largest comeback in NRL Grand Final history to win 26-24.
