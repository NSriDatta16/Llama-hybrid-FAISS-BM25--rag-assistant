Plot summary

The leader of the colony is Roger London, Mark London's son.  London seems to be nothing like his father, however.  Mike Flynn, a Galactic wanderer, spots Isis, and plans to corrupt the inhabitants to obtain the precious firestones.  He promises them a Forever Machine, which will supply them with a lifetime of ambrosia, which means they will never have to work for their food again.  His daughter, Moira, however, knows that he is simply lying, and tries to stop Mike's evil plans with the help of David N'Kumo, great grandson of Jody N'Kumo.  When David and Moira succeed, Jody N'Kumo becomes president, instead of Roger London.  Moira decides to stay on Isis, and Guardian, goes with Mike Flynn.  Things look much brighter for a future for Isis.
