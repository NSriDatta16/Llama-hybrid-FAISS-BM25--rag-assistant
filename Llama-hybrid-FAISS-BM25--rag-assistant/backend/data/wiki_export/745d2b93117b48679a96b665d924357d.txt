West Cheshire is a former parliamentary constituency, which returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

History
Under the Reform Act 1867, the Parliamentary County of Cheshire was divided into three 2-member constituencies. This was achieved by the creation of Mid Cheshire which comprised the Hundred of Bucklow from North Cheshire and the Hundred of Northwich from South Cheshire. Under the Boundary Act 1868, North Cheshire and South Cheshire were renamed East Cheshire and West Cheshire respectively.

Under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, the three 2-member seats were abolished and re-divided into eight single-member constituencies: Altrincham, Crewe, Eddisbury, Hyde, Knutsford, Macclesfield, Northwich and Wirral.

Boundaries
1868â€“1885: The Hundreds of Broxton, Eddisbury, Nantwich, and Wirral, and the City and County of the City of Chester.
