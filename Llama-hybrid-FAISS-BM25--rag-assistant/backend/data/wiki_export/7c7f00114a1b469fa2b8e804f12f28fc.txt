Sadler's Mill, also referred to as Saddlers Mill, is a watermill in Romsey, Hampshire, England. It is probably the best known of Romsey's surviving mills and is apparently the only mill to be developed on the main course of the River Test.  The existence of Sadler's Mill is first recorded in the 16th century, when it was owned by the manor of Great and Little Spursholt.  Functioning as a corn and grist mill, it has passed through a succession of owners including Lord Palmerston who rebuilt it in 1747 and sold it in 1777 to one Benjamin Dawkins.  Following another succession of owners it returned to the Broadlands estate in 1889.  Milling ceased in 1932, when the mill building became redundant.  The Broadlands estate sold the building in 2003, at which point it was close to collapse having been derelict for many years. Anthony and Sarah de Sigley, restored the building in 2005, rebuilding much of the original structure.  During the restoration evidence of an earlier structure was found; carbon-14 dating established the age of this to be c. 1650. The restoration was completed by Dave Northway and Amanda Deeming, the new owners from 2008 onwards.

It is a Grade II listed building.
