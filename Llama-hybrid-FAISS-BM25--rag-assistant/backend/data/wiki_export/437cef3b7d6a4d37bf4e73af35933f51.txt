Moscow Leningradsky railway terminal  (, Leningradsky vokzal) also known as Moscow Passazhirskaya station () is the oldest of Moscow's nine railway terminals. Situated on Komsomolskaya Square, the station serves north-western directions, notably Saint Petersburg. International services from the station include Tallinn, Estonia, operated by GoRail, and Helsinki, Finland.

It is the only Moscow railway terminal operated by October Railway rather than Moscow Railway.

History

The station was constructed between 1844 and 1851 to an eclectic design by Konstantin Thon as the terminus of the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway, a pet project of Emperor Nicholas I. Regular connection was opened in 1851. Initially it was known as Peterburgsky (i.e., St Petersburg station). Upon the Emperor's death five years later, the station was named Nikolayevsky (and the railway Nikolayevskaya) after him and retained this name until 1924, when the Bolsheviks renamed it Oktyabrsky terminal (and the corresponding railway to October railway), to commemorate the October Revolution. The present name was given in 1937.

Thon's design follows closely that of the station's counterpart in St. Petersburg. The monotonous regularity of rustication and pilasters is enlivened with Italianate details (ground floor windows strongly reminiscent of the Palazzo Rucellai) and an elegant clocktower at the centre (probably inspired by the Palazzo Senatorio in Rome). Even more rigorous is the exterior of the nearby Moscow Customs House (1844–1852), also by Thon. The interior of the station was modernized and renovated in 1950 and 1972.
