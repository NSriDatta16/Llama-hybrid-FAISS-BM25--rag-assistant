The Beit El Yeshiva () is a Religious Zionist Yeshiva situated in the Israeli settlement of Beit El, a community in the Binyamin region near Ramallah in the Israeli-controlled Area C of the West Bank.

History
The Yeshiva was founded in late 1977 by a group of students from the Mercaz haRav yeshiva in Jerusalem. The students originally lived on a nearby army base, but today the yeshiva has its own premises, and over 250 students enrolled. The rosh yeshiva (dean) is Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed.

Arutz Sheva - Israel National News was founded and is maintained by the Beit El Yeshiva. The Beit El Yeshiva also founded Yeshiva.co, a large Jewish website.
