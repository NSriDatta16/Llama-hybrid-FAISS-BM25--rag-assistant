Regions and countries 
 Atlantis: A small continent with many human settlements. Over 21,000 years ago, an event called the "Great Cataclysm" caused it to be submerged into the sea. The inhabitants of ancient Atlantis built an enormous glass-like dome over the capital city, also known as Atlantis. When barbarians sent by the Deviant Lemuria empire attacked Atlantis, King Kamuu opened the magma-pits which were the city's means of heating. This caused the continent to sink. Kamuu was warned of the Great Cataclysm by the seer, Zhered-Na. When she refused to recant, he had her exiled to the mainland, where she was later stabbed to death by survivors of the submersion.
 Attilan (also called the Hidden Land): Home of the Inhumans. Originally an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, it has moved several times, including to the Andes, the Himalayas, the Blue Area of the Moon, and the homeworld of the alien Kree, Hala. Attilan is destroyed during the events of Infinity by Black Bolt when he detonates the Terrigen Bomb. The remains of Attilan subsequently reside within New York, in the Hudson estuary. The remains become a sovereign state, New Attilan, ruled by Medusa.
 Attilan in other media
 Animation
 Attilan appears in Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode "Inhuman Nature". Crystal takes A-Bomb, who falls in love with her. Hulk, Red Hulk, She-Hulk and Skaar track him down and meet the Inhumans upon being captured, but they break free to stop Maximus from using a weapon that he plans to use to destroy humanity. Failing, Attilan is locked in a barrier by Maximus that protects the city from the rest of the world, but is ultimately destroyed by Black Bolt.
 Attilan appears in Ultimate Spider-Man episode "Inhumanity". The city is controlled by Maximus as king to destroy humanity. Spider-Man and Triton defeat him and with the help of Black Bolt, Attilan falls into the ocean.
 Attilan appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy episode "Crystal Blue Persuasion", when Ronan the Accuser threatens to destroy the city.  In "Inhuman Touch", the Guardians of the Galaxy go to Attilan again to speak with Maximus about the location of the Cosmic Seed, while he plans to escape his cell to control it and destroy a nearby planet.
 Attilan appears in Avengers Assemble. In the season 3 episode "Inhumans Among Us", the Inhuman Royal Family arrives on Earth; they helps the Avenger stop Alpha Primitives and support a newly emerged inhuman called Inferno. In "The Inhuman Condition", Attilan is taken over by Ultron who uses the Inhumans to create a dangerous weapon on Earth; Terrigen mist spreads on Earth and Attilan lands to search for new Inhumans. In "Civil War, Part 1: The Fall of Attilan", after the Avengers capture Maximus and bring him to Attilan, he causes Inferno to enrage and destroy all of Attilan. Truman Marsh goes ahead with the Inhumans Registration Act where the Inhumans will have inscription discs imposed on them after the destruction of Attilan. At the end of "Civil War, Part 4: Avengers Revolution", Attilan is rebuilt again. In the season 5 episode "Mists of Attilan", Black Panther takes Ms. Marvel on a mission to Attilan.
 Attilan appears in the second season of Marvel Future Avengers. Following an outbreak of Terrigen Mist, the Inhumans claim custody of the afflicted and take them to Attilan. As a result, the Avengers, Future Avengers and Ms. Marvel attempt to broker peace between Earth and Attilan to reunite those taken with their families on Earth.
Live action
 In Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 2, Gordon, an Inhuman, reveals to the already transformed Raina that there is an island not explored by man where Inhumans live, implying that he refers to Attilan. This is its first reference in Marvel Cinematic Universe and foreshadowing of its appearance in the Inhumans series.
 In the Marvel Television-produced TV series Inhumans, at some point in history, a civilization of Inhumans decided to leave Earth to colonize the Moon. They built the city of Attilan in a protective dome, protecting it and keeping it hidden from humans and Kree. After Triton's disappearance, Maximus starts a revolution by taking over Attilan.  This causes the Inhuman royal family (Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Crystal, and Lockjaw) to escape to Earth, while Maximus sends his allies to pursue them. In the series finale, Attilan's protective dome is compromised by Maximus's plan to retain control and ultimately collapses. The royal family organizes an evacuation to Earth with the help of NASA to save the people of Attilan. The destruction of Attilan seems to send a signal to Hala or possibly another Kree outpost. With the help of humans, Black Bolt and Medusa lead the Inhumans to build a new Attilan on Earth.
 Bagalia: A sovereign island nation in an undisclosed location established by the Shadow Council. It is ruled by criminals and populated by the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.

The usual means of access to this dimension is through magic.
 Latveria: A country in Europe ruled by Doctor Doom.
 Lemuria: A small continent and group of islands in the Pacific Ocean 21,000 years ago, which was ruled by the Deviants. Lemuria became the center of the Deviant Empire, and the only remaining free land was Atlantis, the continent that held its greatest enemy, the Atlantean Empire. When the Deviants attacked Atlantis, the Atlantean King Kamuu opened the magma-pits which were the city's means of heating. This caused a chain reaction which collapsed and sank the continent. At that same time, when the Second Host of the Celestials came to Earth, the Deviants attacked them. In retaliation, the Celestials sank Lemuria in what is now known as the "Great Cataclysm". The Eternal Ikaris guided a ship of humans to safety.
 Madripoor: A city modeled after Singapore, to which Wolverine has connections.
 Monster Isle: An island where kaiju-style monsters rule.

Prisons
Alcatraz is a real-life island prison in San Francisco Bay that was operational in 1859–1963. In the Marvel universe, it held superhuman criminals in special section in the 1940s; the designation "the Alcatraz Annex" has been used in various Marvel handbooks to distinguish it from Alcatraz in general. First mentioned in Marvel Mystery Comics #26 (1941), when the android Human Torch's foe the Parrot was being transported there. Later seen in Human Torch #8 (1942), when the Golden Age Angel's foe the Python escaped. During the "Dark Reign" storyline, Alcatraz was occupied by H.A.M.M.E.R. as a detention center for the mutants that are apprehended by the Dark Avengers. During the "AXIS" storyline, Iron Man used Alcatraz as the site of Stark Island.

 (Potential Energy Group, Alternate Sources, United States) was originally intended to research alternative (and unusual) forms of energy. It was later used as a prison for super-powered individuals with energy-based powers. It was originally located in the Adirondack Mountains, New York. Several heroes have served terms working security at the facility, including the Thing and Quasar. At one time, it also served as a temporary home for the Squadron Supreme when they were exiled from their own universe. The Ultimate Marvel version of P.E.G.A.S.U.S. appeared in the series Ultimate Power. This Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S was located in Devil's Point, Wyoming. It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. program that served to store all objects of mysterious origin or unexplained power that United States authorities had accumulated over the years, in which every precaution was made to keep the objects safe. Originally, Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was the center of "S.H.I.E.L.D.'s universe" (something that the recent directors of S.H.I.E.L.D., Carol Danvers and Nick Fury, were completely unaware of). It was later reduced to a storage house, but still kept some of the original facility which included an underground laboratory. Project Pegasus was attacked two times by the Serpent Squad, who had come for the Serpent Crown that was stored there, and was protected by the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Iceman, and Rick Jones. P.E.G.A.S.U.S. also housed the Watcher Uatu after it was discovered by American personnel at Project Rebirth, until Uatu was "activated" and forewarned the Fantastic Four, Carol Danvers, and P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s overseer, Wendell Vaughn, about an upcoming cataclysm before it disappeared. Following the events of Ultimatum, Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was put on alert in the wake of unexplained attacks on the Baxter Building and Roxxon Industries. P.E.G.A.S.U.S.'s personnel were aided by Captain Mahr-Vehl, but Mahr-Vehl was infected with an unknown virus and went berserk, attacking P.E.G.A.S.U.S. personnel. Mahr-Vehl was transported away by Rick Jones/Nova, but that left Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. vulnerable. It was invaded by the true instigator of the attacks, Reed Richards, who pilfered the facility's valuable possessions. Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. was created in Marvel Two-in-One #42 (August 1978) by writers Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio,

In the 1990s, Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. played host to the Tesseract until the present, during which Loki steals it, destroying the facility in the process. The organization first appears in Thor and makes subsequent appearances in The Avengers and Captain Marvel.
The Raft  is a prison facility for super-human criminals (predominantly supervillains). Created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist David Finch, it first appeared in The New Avengers #1 (2005) as the "Maximum-Maximum Security" wing of the Ryker's Island Maximum Security Penitentiary. The Raft is introduced as the setting of a large-scale prison break, with the New Avengers being concerned when their analysis of computer records shows that some of the Raft's inmates are listed as having been dead for years. One of the former guards notes that the prisoners developed "hierarchies", congregating with others who share some aspect of their powers or nature. Crossfire, for example, formed a small gang with Controller, Corruptor, Mandrill and Mister Fear, who all can manipulate others' minds. The Raft is the setting of a multi-part story in Spider-Man's Tangled Web featuring Tombstone as a villain-protagonist. The Raft was later converted into Spider-Island Two by Otto Octavius (in Peter Parker's body) until it was destroyed by the Goblin King.

 Institute for the Criminally Insane was a maximum-security asylum for the mentally ill. Many insane or mentally ill murderers and supervillains were kept at the institute. The institute was first mentioned in Web of Spider-Man #112, written by Terry Kavanagh. Ravencroft officially opened in Web of Spider-Man Annual #10 (1994). The institute is featured in a number of Spider-Man storylines. Dr. Ashley Kafka was the founder and first director of Ravencroft. John Jameson was head of security. Both were fired in The Spectacular Spider-Man #246 and Dr. Leonard Samson became Ravencroft's new director; Samson's next owned a private practice instead of running the institute. The institute reappeared in Vengeance of the Moon Knight. In this incarnation, it housed mostly non-superpowered psychopaths and had an imposing metal front gate with a Gothic facade similar to DC's Arkham Asylum. Ravencroft's known patients include Carnage, Chameleon, D.K., Doctor Octopus, Electro, Green Goblin, Gale, Jackal, Massacre, Mayhem, Mysterio, Prism, Pyromania, Ramon Grant, Shriek, Venom, Vulture, and Webber. The storyline after Absolute Carnage, Ruins of Ravencroft eventually explains its true origin. It turns out that the institute is more than just for the criminally insane.

Outer space

Planets
 Counter-Earth: There have been four versions of the hypothetical planet known as Counter-Earth, each one a near-duplicate of Earth. Featured in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and Spider-Man Unlimited.
 "High Evolutionary's Counter-Earth": The first Counter-Earth was created by the High Evolutionary with the help of at least some of the Infinity Gems as part of his "Project Alpha". The High Evolutionary artificially creates a Counter-Earth specifically located to hide it from "True Earth"; on his planet he has greatly accelerated evolution and the passage of time. Due to a lack of superheroes, the High Evolutionary enlisted Adam Warlock to keep the peace. On Counter-Earth, the Fantastic Four never existed as its Reed Richards became Brute, its Ben Grimm and Human Torch never mutated, and its Susan Storm was placed in a coma, Bruce Banner never became Hulk and has a son with Betty Ross named Bruce Banner Jr., Peter Parker didn't become Spider-Man due to dying from radiation overdose from the spider bite, Stephen Strange operated as Necromancer, Tony Stark didn't get the shrapnel near his heart when he was attacked, and Victor von Doom didn't hate Reed Richards.
 "Goddess's Counter-Earth": The second Counter-Earth, dubbed "Paradise Omega", was created by the Goddess using the Cosmic Egg, a collection of 30 Cosmic Cubes.
 "Franklin Richards's Counter-Earth": The third Counter-Earth was created by Franklin Richards in the transition from the Onslaught storyline to the Heroes Reborn event. As Franklin watched the Fantastic Four, Avengers and others sacrifice their lives to defeat Onslaught, he unwittingly tapped into his latent cosmic power to create a pocket universe and divert the heroes there to prevent their deaths. On the Earth of this new dimension, the heroes relived altered versions of their pasts, unaware of their previous lives in the "mainstream" Marvel Universe, where they were presumed dead.
 "Onslaught Reborn Counter-Earth": The fourth Counter-Earth was also created by Franklin Richards after the events of House of M unexpectedly resurrected Onslaught, who immediately resumed his mission to appropriate the power of Franklin Richards.

The Skrulls, then a benevolent race, moderated this contest, whose goal was to determine the worthiness of both races by discovering which could achieve more within a set period of time. After being taken to the area of Earth's Moon where the Skrulls had created the artificial atmosphere, the Kree used their strength and rudimentary Skrull technology to create a giant city, while the Cotati were taken to another barren world in a different solar system where they created a long-term sustainable ecosystem. Learning that the Cotati were going to win the contest, the enraged Kree first slaughtered the Cotati and then attacked and killed the Skrull delegation, stole their starship, and initiated the millennia-long conflict now known as the Kree-Skrull War, which would force the Skrulls to become a society of warriors. The Blue Area of the Moon was also the home of Uatu the Watcher and a brief location for Attilan.

Designed by Reed Richards and built by Stark Enterprises and Fantastic Four Inc., it is located in the Negative Zone. The inmates call the facility "Fantasy Island" and "Wonderland", probably because prisoners who are unable to manipulate technology to their own ends are connected to virtual reality systems. It is also referred to as "File 42" due to it being the 42nd item on a list written by Tony Stark, Reed Richards and Hank Pym of ways to make a world with super-powered beings safer. The prison is an extremely secure, clean facility with cells custom-designed for each inhabitant. Notable inmates during the war include Iron Fist (Daredevil stand-in), Robbie Baldwin and Cloak and Dagger. After the war, it is now used for super-villains, and was known to house at the very least Taskmaster and Lady Deathstrike until Taskmaster made a deal with Camp Hammond to become an instructor and Lady Deathstrike somehow escaped as she appeared in X-Men: Messiah Complex. However, the prison was later overrun by Negative Zone ruler Blastaar.

 Gene Nation: On the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre, a horrific event in which Mr. Sinister's henchmen the Marauders killed many Morlocks, the members of the terrorist group known as Gene Nation reappeared in the main universe (Earth-616). Their mission was to destroy one human for every Morlock life that was lost.
 The Hand: The Hand is a cult of evil, mystical ninja who are heavily involved in organized crime and mercenary activities such as assassination plots. The Hand covets power above all other objectives. They are primarily based in Japan, but operate internationally. They were founded in the 16th century, and soon became servants of the primordial demon known only as the Beast.
 Hellfire Club: Although the club appears to merely be an international social club for wealthy elites, its Inner Circle consists of mutants who try to influence world events for the accumulation of power. They dress in 18th century garb and rank themselves in a system of chess pieces (Black Rook, White Queen, etc.). The group first battled the X-Men in the classic "The Dark Phoenix Saga" and the club, or branches of it, have since appeared periodically in various X-Men series. The club is based on the actual Hellfire Club, a secret society of 18th century England.
 Humanity's Last Stand: Humanity's Last Stand is a radical anti-mutant hate group and enemies of the X-Men. In the group's first appearance they were behind the creation of a false Mutant Liberation Front, formed by human members of H.L.S. posing as mutants through the use of mutagenic drugs and/or technologically enhanced suits, to mimic mutant powers.
 HYDRA: A terrorist organization that first appeared in Strange Tales #135. In its original continuity, it was headed by nondescript businessman Arnold Brown, who was killed by S.H.I.E.L.D. It soon returned, however, headed by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, under the aegis of the Nazi Red Skull; HYDRA's changing origin was one of the earliest Marvel retcons. After its initial defeat, several of its branches surfaced, appearing to be unrelated and independent. HYDRA's scientific branch was initially A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), which later split off into its own organization. Other factions included THEM (the ruling council of HYDRA) and the Secret Empire (which, like A.I.M., also split off into its own organization).

 Mys-Tech: The board of Mys-Tech, a multinational corporation, were originally seven mages who in AD 987 sold their souls to the demon Mephisto in exchange for immortality.  The Mys-Tech board members must provide a steady stream of souls to the demon, otherwise they will breach their contract and forfeit their own souls.  Over the years, the board accumulated power and wealth and in the modern age this power and wealth became a business empire.
 National Force: The National Force is a neo-fascist organization founded by Doctor Faustus. Faustus had captured William Burnside, the fourth Captain America, and his partner Jack Monroe, both heroes from the 1950s, frozen in suspended animation. Faustus took control of the mind of the replacement Captain America in an attempt to use him against Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, and later turned him into the Grand Director.
 Purifiers: A paramilitary group of Christian terrorists led by William Stryker, also known as the "Stryker Crusade". The group debuted in the graphic novel X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills. The Purifiers see themselves in a holy war against mutants, believing them to be the children of the devil and thus deserving of extermination.
 Roxxon: A massive petroleum corporation notorious for its determination to make massive profits regardless of any laws or moral principles, often employing superhuman criminals to achieve their goals.
 Secret Empire: The subversive organization known as the Secret Empire has followed a number of different leaders, always known as "Number One". The Secret Empire began as a subsidiary of HYDRA, which provided it with financial support. The Secret Empire served to distract the attention of authorities such as S.H.I.E.L.D. from HYDRA's activities, although the original Number One sought to break away from HYDRA.
 Serpent Society: An organization of snake-themed terrorists that was initially formed from the membership of two previous supervillain teams, both of them called the Serpent Squad. The group, like its predecessor, has been made up of longtime antagonists of Captain America and his fellow Avengers. The Serpent Society was the brainchild of Seth Voelker (Sidewinder) and is a descendant of sorts from the original two Serpent Squads.
 Sons of the Serpent:  A subversive organization of costumed American racist super-patriots who oppose all racial, ethnic, and religious minorities. They sought to subvert America through hate crimes and organized protests, and were opposed by the Avengers and the Defenders.
 THEM: THEM, through its founder Baron Strucker, is the managing power of a supraorganization which includes HYDRA, A.I.M., and the Secret Empire. THEM was founded by Nazi war criminal Baron Strucker after World War II. Later Strucker appointed a businessman named Arnold Brown to the position of Supreme Hydra; HYDRA's highly visible operations served as a front for THEM.
 U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.: The Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind is a terrorist organization in the Marvel Comics universe. It was founded by the Flag-Smasher in his attempts to destroy nationalism. Most notably, they have been engaged in a feud with Deadpool ever since he slaughtered many of them aboard their own helicarrier, downed it (dooming the remaining), and confronted them (led by a new Flag-Smasher) in a final revenge showdown on a Kansas farm, where Deadpool slaughtered every single one of them (presumably ending them for good).
 The Universal Church of Truth: The Universal Church of Truth (UCT) is a star-spanning religious empire headed by the Magus, and enemies of the Guardians of the Galaxy. A different version of the Universal Church led by Cardinal Raker appeared in the second volume of Guardians of the Galaxy, The Thanos Imperative miniseries, and Annihilators: Earthfall miniseries. The church was responsible for resurrecting Thanos and the Magus. They were rebranded Universal Believers in the Guardians of the Galaxy show  and central villains in the 2021 Guardians of the Galaxy game.
 Zodiac Cartel: The original Zodiac group debuted in the title the Avengers and is established as a criminal organization founded and funded by member Cornelius Van Lunt (who adopts the identity of Taurus).

The on-board computer performs navigation functions, remote sensor image-enhancement, and radar interpretation. Moon Knight has had at least two different designs of copter. One resembled a conventional helicopter with a crescent moon tail. The second actually resembled an airship more than a helicopter, but was also crescent shaped.

The Shockwave Rider is powered by a Zero-Point Squirt Drive, giving it a nearly unlimited fuel supply. The Rider contains 5 tesseract zones, allowing it to be spacious on the inside while keeping it compact on the outside. To deploy in the field, the team dives through a pool of an orange membrane to exit via the underside of the ship. It was destroyed in Nextwave's final battle with the Beyond Corporation.
 Skuttlebutt: A Korbinite-designed sentient starship, vehicle of Beta Ray Bill where its A.I. serves as his companion.
