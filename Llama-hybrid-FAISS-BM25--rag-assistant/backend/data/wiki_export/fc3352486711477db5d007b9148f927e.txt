Each member of this convention shall be obliged to provide sickness benefits to the persons protected under article 7.

Article 19 
Persons protected under Article 7 include all employees and apprentices, groups constituting at least 75 percent of the total economically active population and all residents who meet the conditions for Article 24.

Article 20 
In the case of an additional declaration under Article 2, protected persons under Article 7 include groups of employees constituting at least 25 percent of all employees or at least 50 percent of all employees in industrial establishments.

Article 21 
Sickness benefits under Article 18 must be recurring payments calculated to meet the requirements of Article 22 or Article 23 and, in the case of sickness, the conditions of Article 24.

Article 22 
In the case of recurrent sickness payments, the benefit rate must be set so that the beneficiary reaches at least 60 percent of the total amount of previous earnings and the amount of family allowances due to a protected person with the same family responsibilities as the standard benefit recipient.
The previous basic earnings of the beneficiary are calculated from the classes to which they previously belonged.
A maximum limit can be prescribed for the benefit rate if it does not exceed the wage of a male worker.
The previous earnings of the beneficiary, wages of the male skilled worker, benefit and family allowance, if any, are calculated on the same time frame.
For the other beneficiaries, the benefit must be in proportion to the benefit for standard beneficiaries.
Male skilled worker means a locksmith or lathe operator in the manufacture of machinery, a person who is considered a typical skilled worker, a person whose annual earnings are equal to or greater than 75 percent of all protected persons, or a person whose earnings are greater than 125 percent of the average earnings.
A typical skilled worker is a person who belongs to the largest major group in the industry and to the department with the largest number of male workers within the establishment.
If the benefit rate differs by area, the male skilled worker can be determined for each area in accordance with Articles 6 and 7.
The wage of the male skilled worker is fixed by collective agreement, domestic legislation or customary law for normal working hours. If the rate varies from region to region, the middle rate is set in accordance with Article 8.

Article 23 
In the case of recurrent sickness payments, the benefit rate must be calculated so that the recipient under Article 7 receives at least 60 percent of the total amount of remuneration and the amount of family allowances.
In this case, the pay and family allowance is calculated for the same period of time.
For other beneficiaries, the benefit must be in reasonable proportion to the standard benefits.
An ordinary adult male worker shall be deemed to be a person typically engaged in unskilled work in the manufacture of machinery or a person engaged in the field in which most of the male labor force, protected under Article 7, is engaged. For this purpose, the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities adopted by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations at its Seventh Session on 27 August 1948 is used.
If the benefit rate varies by region, the ordinary adult male worker can be determined for each region.
The wage of an ordinary adult worker must be determined on the basis of the collective agreement, national legislation or customary law. In the case of different rates in different areas, the middle rate is used.

Article 24 
In the case of recurring payment, the benefit rate is determined according to a prescribed scale by the competent public authority.
Such rate can be reduced only to the extent that the other resources of the beneficiary's family exceed the determined amounts.
The total amount of the benefit and other resources after reduction shall ensure the family's subsistence in health and morals and must not be less than the benefit calculated in Article 23.
This is satisfied if the total amount of benefits exceeds by at least 30 percent the amount that would result from Article 23 and Article 19.

Article 25 
If a protected person is required to fulfill a waiting period under Article 18, the period must be designed in such a way that the protected person does not lose entitlement to benefits.

If the right to remuneration is lawfully suspended during the first period of incapacity for work, it must not exceed three days.

Article 27 
In the event of the death of a person entitled to sickness benefits under Article 18, a death grant shall be paid to the survivors or bearers of the funeral expenses.
A member may derogate from the provision if he has assumed obligations on disability, old-age and survivors' benefits, if he is entitled to at least 80 percent of the work allowance in case of sickness under his legislation, and if he is covered by voluntary insurance providing funeral benefits.
