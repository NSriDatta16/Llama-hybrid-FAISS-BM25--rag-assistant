History 
Pattensen was first mentioned in a document in 986, nevertheless, the first people probably settled in the old town between the 6th and 8th century.

In the 13th century, Graf Ludolf II. von Hallermund built the Pattensen Castle to monitor the important trade routes that crossed the city in north–south and west–east directions. From the middle of the 13th century, the city belonged to the Principality of Lüneburg. The city was of strategic military importance, so that it was heavily fortified and enlarged as a result. In the area of the present town of Pattensen, also the Calenberg Castle and the Koldingen Castle were built in these times. In 1433, Pattensen became part of the Principality of Calenberg. During the Reformation the city was the seat of an archdeacon under the leadership of the superintendent Antonius Corvinus. At that time the city was often the venue for church synods and state parliament meetings.

During the centuries, Pattensen was repeatedly destroyed and plundered as a result of armed conflicts like the War of the Lüneburg Succession (end of 14th century), the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud (1519-1523) or the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The city was also destroyed multiple times in several devastating fires, the largest ones in 1655 and 1733. From 1806 to 1813 the city was under French rule and belonged to the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1866, the Prussian army occupied the region.

In 1974 the surrounding villages were incorporated and today's town of Pattensen was founded.
