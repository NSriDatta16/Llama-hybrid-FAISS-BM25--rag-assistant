History

BKDP was founded in 1993.

In September 2020, during the 2020â€“2021 Belarusian protests, the Belarusian government arrested workers striking at Belaruskali. Some of the workers were members of BKDP affiliate Belarusian Independent Trade Union, including its vice-president.

On April 7, 2022, the KGB declared the BKDP affiliate Belarusian Radio-Electrical Manufacturing Workers' Trade Union to be an extremist formation. This was the first time that Belarusian authorities had designated a registered trade union as extremist. On April 19, law enforcement agencies raided the offices of BKDP and several affiliate unions. They confiscated computers, paperwork and union flags. BKDP president Aliaksandr Yarashuk, vice-president Siarhei Antusevich and other officials from BKDP and affiliated unions were also arrested. The European Trade Union Confederation and the International Labour Organization condemned the arrests of the officials and demanded they be set free.

In July 2022, the Supreme court of Belarus forcibly dissolved all the affiliated unions and the Congress itself, ostensibly for taking part in 'destructive activity' and 'disseminating extremist content'.

In late 2022 and early 2023, Belarusian courts sentenced the leaders of the independent unions to several years in prison.
