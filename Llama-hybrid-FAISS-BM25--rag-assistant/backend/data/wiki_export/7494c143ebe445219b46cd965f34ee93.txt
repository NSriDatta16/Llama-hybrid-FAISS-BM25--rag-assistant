Merritt 7 station is a commuter rail stop on the Danbury Branch of the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, located in Norwalk, Connecticut. Merritt 7 is named after an adjacent business park based near the interchange of the Merritt Parkway and Route 7. The station has one high-level 6-car long side platform to the west of the single track. It is owned and operated by the Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT).

History 

The Merritt 7 corporate park built the station while separating the station from building entrances by a fence to make the complex transit adjacent but not transit-oriented. The station was opened on July 29, 1985, by Metro-North. At the time of its opening, it was the only privately built rail station in Connecticut. Construction of the station cost $750,000.

The station was rebuilt with a  six-car-long high-level platform on the west side of the tracks, slightly north of the former station. The new station has a full-length canopy and an accessible pedestrian overpass with elevators. The state authorized funding for the project in 2017. Bidding took place in Aprilâ€“June 2020; construction began that September. The new platform opened on June 7, 2023, but the footbridge over the tracks to the office park was delayed due to supply chain issues with glass panels.
