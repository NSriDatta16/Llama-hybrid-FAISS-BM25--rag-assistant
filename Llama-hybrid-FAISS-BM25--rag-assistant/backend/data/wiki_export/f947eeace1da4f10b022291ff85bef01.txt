Heckmondwike Grammar School (HGS) is an 11–18 mixed, grammar school and sixth form with academy status in Heckmondwike, West Yorkshire, England.

History 
The school was built by the Heckmondwike School Board after it was compelled by the Board of Education to replace various schools across Heckmondwike. The Board began the process in January 1894, and despite much controversy, the building of the school had finished by late 1897. Arthur Alfred Stott of Mirfield was the architect. The school opened on 17 January 1898, with an attendance of 907, with around 150-160 attending the School of Science. The School's Main Hall, now known as the Swann Hall, was named by the School Board after Dr K Swann, a former Chair of Governors. 

Following the Education Act 1902 and the wider development of Secondary Education across the country, the Higher Grade School became the Secondary School, as the infant's section was moved into another building. It would be renamed Heckmondwike Grammar School in late 1929. 

Further north in Cleckheaton was Whitcliffe Mount Grammar School, now Whitcliffe Mount School. The existence of Secondary Education across the Spen Valley was decisive as both Heckmondwike and Cleckheaton desired to have the major secondary school in their respective locality. Eventually, Whitcliffe Mount was created after the failure of the West Riding County Council to solve the Spen Valley Question.  

HGS was a foundation school, but became an academy in September 2010.

On 18 January 2011, the Crellin Building was officially opened by Prince Edward, with Ingrid Roscoe and the mayor of Kirklees.

In December 2018, the headteacher at the time, Nathan Bulley, quit following allegations of mismanagement.

Admissions 
HGS is a Technology College. The school has approximately 1,500 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and includes a sixth form.

Prospective pupils pass examinations in verbal reasoning, non-verbal reasoning, English, comprehension and mathematics before entry to the school. After testing, 180–210 pupils are accepted.

The HGS Annexe, which was formerly a church hall, which was previously used for physical education and social sciences was reopened in 2019 as the Jo Cox Sixth Form Centre, in memory of the late MP and former head girl of the School.
