Okama is a Japanese manga artist and illustrator. He is known as the artist of Cloth Road as well as the original character designer for Himawari and Glass no Kantai. He was also involved in Gunbuster 2, most noticeably in the ending design.

Okama began his career by publishing various dōjin works (usually hentai themed), and made his debut in the professional world in 1998, with most of his early work also being hentai erotica themed. In late 1999, he began his first non-adult orientated serialization Cat's World.

Okama also means a gay, effeminate or female-presenting man. The artist's explanation for his name is that he always plays female characters in online games.
