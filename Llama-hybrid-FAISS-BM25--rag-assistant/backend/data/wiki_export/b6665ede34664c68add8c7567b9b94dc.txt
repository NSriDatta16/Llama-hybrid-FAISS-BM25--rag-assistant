Excepter is an experimental music group from Brooklyn, founded in 2002 by No-Neck Blues Band member John Fell Ryan. They have released their work on labels such as Load Records and Animal Collective's Paw Tracks, and are known for their improvisational approach to playing both live and in the studio.

The Village Voice alt-weekly has mentioned the subject of the band's attire, with blogger and (former) Voice writer, Nick Sylvester referring to them as having "ousted Animal Collective as the Village People of Brooklyn Noise". The significance of their hats was noted several more times. In 2007 the Pendu Sound compilation album Getting rid of the glue with Excepter and Daniel Carter was listed as number 70 in Thurston Moore's "Top 80 of 2006".

Nathan Corbin and Clare Amory participated as drummers in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance which occurred on July 7, 2007 at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Excepter was featured on the cover of The Wires May 2010 issue.

Member Clare Amory died of cancer on February 24, 2011.
