Damnocracy was a heavy metal supergroup formed on, and for, the VH1 TV show Supergroup in 2006. The members of the band ultimately dubbed their band project Damnocracy.

The band's assumed manager was Doc McGhee, who has managed the likes of Kiss, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, and Night Ranger. He had previously worked with Sebastian Bach in the rock band Skid Row.

The band did not release any albums and disbanded in 2010. Its members continued to perform with their original bands or moved on to new projects.
