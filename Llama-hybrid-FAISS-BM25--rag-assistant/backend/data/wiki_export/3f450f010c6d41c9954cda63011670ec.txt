Meet the Supremes is the debut studio album by The Supremes, released in late 1962 on Motown.

Background
The LP includes the group's earliest singles: "I Want a Guy", "Buttered Popcorn", "Your Heart Belongs to Me" and "Let Me Go the Right Way". The earliest recordings on this album, done between fall 1960 and fall 1961, feature the Supremes as a quartet composed of teenagers Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin. Martin left the group in early 1962 to start a family, and the other three girls continued as a trio. Martin is not pictured on the album because of her departure earlier in the year, although her vocals are present on the majority of the recordings on the album (as well as other recordings made during that period). She does have a spoken interlude line (as do the other group members) on the bridge of the song "(He's) Seventeen", and also sings lead on "After All", a song recorded for but not originally included on the album. Along with these songs, Ballard and Wilson are heard out front on other songs as well. Wilson sings lead on "The Tears" (another former non-album track) and "Baby Don't Go"; Ballard has leads on a handful of songs as well (see below), including "Buttered Popcorn" and the short intro line to "Let Me Go the Right Way".

None of these singles charted within the top 40 of the Billboard Pop Singles chart, leading to the group being referred to around the Motown offices as the "no-hit" Supremes. By the time of their next LP, Where Did Our Love Go, the Supremes would have two top 40 hits to their name, one of them, "Where Did Our Love Go", a number-one hit.

Meet The Supremes was originally issued only in monaural sound. A stereo remix of the album, with a new cover, was issued along with the original mono version in 1965. Additionally, a deluxe two compact disc edition was released by Hip-O Select in the spring of 2010, which included both the mono and stereo versions of the album, as well as several outtakes, non-album tracks and live performances.

The original album track order contained ten songs.  Side 1: Your Heart Belongs To Me; Who's Lovin' You; Baby Don't Go; Buttered Popcorn; I Want A Guy.  Side 2:  The Boy That Got Away; You Bring Back Memories; Play A Sad Song; Never Again; (He's) Seventeen.  This configuration was withdrawn to include the current hit, "Let Me Go The Right Way," and the B-side, "Time Changes Things".  "The Boy That Got Away" was withdrawn from the line-up, giving the album 11 tracks.  [Deluxe Version "Meet The Supremes" 2010].

Critical reception

Andrew Hamilton for Allmusic, described "Your Heart Belongs to Me" as 'romantic and sentimental', writing it 'should have been the Supremes' first hit. It's every bit as charming as his chartbusters for Mary Wells.' Hamilton praised The Supremes' vocals, writing, 'Diana Ross' sweet tender lead, assisted by Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard's warm harmonies, could melt icebergs.' Furthermore, Hamilton praised their 'enthusiastic vocals' on "Let Me Go the Right Way". Hamilton also noted 'Ross' vocals on "Who's Lovin' You" are intense and bluesy; Wilson leads the soulful "Baby Don't Go"; and Ballard leads the raucous "Buttered Popcorn," a tune more suited for the Contours.'

Stevie Chick of The Guardian, listed "Buttered Popcorn" as one of the best 10 Supremes songs. Chick expressed that Ballard was 'A bold, big-voiced belter' and described the song as 'A piece of raw, ribald soul lacking the polish that gilded their [The Supremes'] later hits'. Also, 'Ballard growls salaciously on Buttered Popcorn that her boyfriend “likes it greasy, and sticky, and salty, and gooey”, a knowingly saucy performance that somehow escaped the interference of Motown's infamous Quality Control department.' Similarly, Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste wrote 'the innuendo-laced track is not unlike buttered popcorn — salty, fluffy, and oh so good'. Contemporary reviews of "Buttered Popcorn" include a B+ from Cashbox, whilst music columnist Wayne Harada in The Honolulu Advertiser called the song 'A novelty' which 'merits attention'.

On the contrary, Hamilton expressed that on their first recording, "I Want a Guy," 'the backing voices are buried, and Ross' voice sounds whiny and high-pitched', describing "I Want a Guy" and 'the '50s-sounding "He's Seventeen," as 'the only bummers'. More positively, "Time Changes Things" is noted as 'a forerunner to later efforts by Holland-Dozier-Holland',  "Play a Sad Song" is described as a 'torching' ballad 'Blues lovers will relish' and the 'straight '50s doo wop' of "Never Again" drew a comparison to the Chantels.

American music critic Tom Hull noted the album is 'mostly songs by Berry Gordy Jr. or Smokey Robinson,' which 'spawned four singles that went nowhere, although "I Want a Guy" and "Let Me Go the Right Way" are catchy enough.'
