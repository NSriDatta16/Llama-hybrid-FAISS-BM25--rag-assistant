The Harborough Mail is a weekly newspaper which serves Market Harborough and the surrounding area. The Harborough Mail was owned by Welland Valley Newspapers, a company established in April 1883, but is now part of Northamptonshire Newspapers but the Harborough Mail itself was established in 1854. Northants Newspapers and Welland Valley Newspapers are both part of Johnston Press. The newspaper is brought out every Thursday and contains the usual local newspaper fair such as local news and sport results. The newspaper also contains a cartoon called 'Mal & Lard' - which features two ducks called Mal and Lard, and a children's club called "Harbie's Gang". Harbie the newshound makes regular appearances at public events and has a whole page dedicated to him and his gang every week. The Mal & Lard cartoon is drawn by Harborough artist Nathan Shelton under his business name Ant Creations.

In April 2006, the Harborough Mail began publishing a secondary free-sheet delivered directly to homes within Market Harborough, the Harborough Citizen.

History
The paper began in a dusty cellar in Church Street, Harborough in 1854, when a Harborough printer and stationer laid down the foundations of the Harborough Mail. Below is a timeline of the important events over the last century and a half that have helped shape Mr Eland's Market Harboro' Advertiser into today's Harborough paper.

January 1854: The Market Harboro' Advertiser is launched as a monthly issue by William Eland, a printer and stationer, from his offices in Church Street. Eland took advantage of the abolition of Advertisement Duty to convince businesses it was cheaper to advertise in the paper rather than use printed bills. Eland also wanted to enrich the paper with "gems of literature of a miscellaneous but instructive and entertaining character."  By the sixth edition, it expanded to twelve pages but only the four outside sheets contained Harborough affairs, the rest was national content.
1890: On Friday 3 October, a rival publication, The Market Harborough Mail, is issued by Northamptonshire Printing and Publishing Co. It is priced 1d and Alfred James Tompkins is the paper's first editor.
1891: Eland sells the Advertiser to a small limited company.
1897: The rival Mail is renamed the Midland Mail on 3 July. It announced: "The Mail has so far outgrown its title that it becomes necessary to give it a new one."
1899: Before the turn of the 20th century, the Mail was sold to JW Logan, Liberal MP for Harborough, and on his death in 1922 ownership passed to his parliamentary secretary Charles Coppack.
1923: Coppack died in February and Tompkins bought the Mail in March after 33 years with the paper.
1923: In November, the two papers merge to become the Market Harborough Advertiser and Midland Mail with the first edition issued on Friday 16 November. It announced: "It has been thought wise to amalgamate the two local papers. The paper will be published on Fridays."
1930s: 'Long' Liz Hollingsworth becomes a renowned newspaper seller at her pitch in Factory Lane.
1942: The broadsheet format is switched to tabloid on 20 March.
1944: In September, after 50 years as a journalist in Harborough, Tompkins sold the paper to East Midlands Allied Press, later known as Emap,  but continued to work on the paper. Tompkins retired in 1946 and died on 3 July 1947. His obituary in the Mail said: "His work as a journalist won him a reputation for honest and impartial reporting and he wrote entertainingly."
1948: RH Freeman becomes the paper's editor.
1951: 16 August, the paper decides to come out on a Thursday. It read: "This change of publication day is being made in order to give readers a better service of news, sport and pictures. We feel sure newsagents will welcome this advance, which should relieve hard-working staff of a certain amount of weekend pressure."

The Other View
In July 2007, the Harborough Mail agreed to do a monthly youth page. It would give students from the local Robert Smyth School a chance to have their say on what is happening in their town. This idea came about when earlier in the year, the paper held a meeting bringing together all generations, called Hands On Harborough. At the end of the three days over which the meetings were held, a student from the Robert Smyth School approached deputy editor Rachel Lusby with the idea of a youth page. Lusby agreed and several months later The Other View had published their first page.
