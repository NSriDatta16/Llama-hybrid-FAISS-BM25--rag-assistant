X-Men OverPower
Released January, 1999 was the second set produced by Marvel, and the last OverPower set ever released. It introduced the aspects, designed to make locations more useful. X-Men Overpower cards were cut incorrectly, being slightly larger than the other cards, which made decks mixing X-Men sets and other sets very hard to shuffle without sleeves. Also, the font used for character's names was different. It contained 200 cards, being 38 characters (26 new and 12 variant), 126 specials (1 Any Character and 5 for each new character except four, that have no specials; also, 15 previous characters got 1 new special), 5 locations, 23 aspects, 4 universe cards and 4 tactic cards.

Unreleased series
Two new expansion sets were designed by Marvel Comics to be released in 1999/2000 to update the game, with new versions of the characters alongside new characters as Angel and Wasp: OverPower: The Marvels (that would have only heroes) and OverPower: Absolute Evil (that would have only villains). These sets were never released, but a complete spoiler for The Marvels somehow spread through the internet.

A third DC expansion was being designed by Fleer before handing the rights over to Marvel Comics. The set was to be titled "Universal Forces" and some pieces of artwork to be used in the set circulated the internet. Locations cards based on DC Comics locations were designed, as well as several new characters including Impulse, Black Lightning, Fate, Deathstroke, and The Rogues.
