Aquaman has made several appearances in numerous adaptations since his comic book debut in 1941. The character has also been referenced beyond the scope of traditional comics entertainment.

Television

Animated

Aquaman's first media appearance was in his own animated series, The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure, in 1967 and 1968. The series, narrated by Ted Knight, proved to be a success, including Filmation studios as it cemented their reputation as a leading provider of Saturday morning programming, the CBS television network. The series featured Mera, Aqualad, a pet walrus named Tusky and Aquaman's and Aqualad's large seahorses, named Storm and Imp respectively. In addition to his usual array of abilities, this version of Aquaman had the power to throw "water balls", which had considerable concussive impact. Aquaman's character voice was provided by Marvin Miller, who was then better known as the voice of Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet.

Super Friends
Aquaman appears in the Super Friends franchise, voiced initially by Norman Alden, and later by William Callaway. This version possesses encyclopedic knowledge of oceanography and oceanology, in addition to his more familiar water-breathing power and aquatic telepathy. However, the series has been blamed for making Aquaman unpopular, and even laughable, by making him appear to be weak.

The Aquaman & Friends Action Hour
The Aquaman & Friends Action Hour aired on Cartoon Network Latin America in 2003 and was produced by Wild Hare Studios of Atlanta, GA. The show, which lasted 7 episodes, was a parody of Aquaman's appearances on Super Friends. In this series, Aquaman is now the host of a children's television series. He is being pursued by the Legion of Doom, who had spent their entire operating budget on attempts to conquer the world and now have to rent out parts of the Hall of Doom as apartments to generate income. Aquaman was chosen as the lead character in this parody series because the producers were not allowed to use the full cast of the Super Friends due to Justice League airing in the United States. The series is separate from the Cartoon Network commercials that aired in the United States that featured Aquaman and Wonder Woman being saved from the Legion of Doom by The Powerpuff Girls and the Aquaman Dance Party commercials that aired during Adult Swim.
Also aired on Tooncast since 2008.

DC Animated Universe

Superman: The Animated Series
Aquaman appeared in the Superman: The Animated Series episode "A Fish Story", voiced by Miguel Ferrer. In the episode, Aquaman, regarded as an urban legend, comes into conflict with Lex Luthor when one of his undersea construction plans threatens Atlantis. He attempts to stop the tests peacefully, but is captured by Luthor. However, he escapes and destroys Luthor's vessel with his army. Aquaman advises Superman to make sure the "surface dwellers" show more respect to the oceans in the future before disappearing.

Batman Beyond
As seen in the two-part Batman Beyond episode "The Call", Aquaman's daughter Aquagirl is a member of a future Justice League. During the episode, Terry McGinnis/Batman goes over profiles of the current Justice League members, one of which states that Aquaman is currently missing.

Justice League/Justice League Unlimited
Aquaman appears in several episodes of the animated television series Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Scott Rummell. This version was based closely on the hot-headed antihero persona of the 1994 and 2001 Aquaman comic book series, with the Viking-like appearance and hook prostheses. Here, he sacrificed his hand to save his infant son from being killed in a plot against his life by his evil brother Orm. He later appeared in Justice League Unlimited as a member of the Justice League. According to the website Television Without Pity, producers created Devil Ray and removed Aquaman and Black Manta from the series before the episode "To Another Shore" because the rights to Aquaman were unavailable due to the concurrent production of the proposed and unaired Aquaman series.

Batman: The Brave and the Bold
Aquaman was a regular supporting character on the television series Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by John DiMaggio. In the series, Aquaman is king of Atlantis and protector of all the seas. Batman describes him as a friendly, happy-go-lucky adventurer with a "larger-than-life" personality; he has habits of giving his exploits titles such as "The Mystery of The Stolen Statue" and "The Secret of the Mechanical Sea Monster", and telling these tales to anyone within distance of his voice. He uses the phrase "Outrageous!" whenever he is shocked and peppers his speech with sea-based references. Aquaman can breathe underwater, has super strength and the ability to communicate telepathically with sea life, in addition to manipulate the water around him and create balls, swords, and shields. His character design is based primarily on his classic character design, but with a beard. In the series finale "Mitefall!", Bat-Mite attempts to get the series cancelled by making it jump the shark in as many ways as possible; this includes changing Aquaman's voice actor from John DiMaggio to Ted McGinley (regarded as the "patron saint" of shark-jumping). Ambush Bug (voiced by Henry Winkler) manages to restore the hero's original voice by getting "Aquaman" to admit to being McGinley. The Crime Syndicate counterpart of Aquaman appears in episode "Deep Cover for Batman!" and is named Sea King.

Young Justice
Aquaman appears as a member of the JLA in Young Justice, voiced by Phil LaMarr. He resembles his bearded appearance, but wears a type of footwear that exposes the heel and toe areas of his feet. In "Independence Day", he and Aqualad end up defeating Killer Frost in Hawaii. He and the other adult mentors of the sidekicks end up called away to help Zatara and the other Justice League members prevent Wotan from blotting out the sun. In "Fireworks", he and the other Justice League members arrive at the ruined Cadmus building following Aqualad, Kid Flash, Robin, and Superboy's fight with Blockbuster. When the sidekicks and Superboy wanted some involvement with the Justice League, Aquaman ends up agreeing with Batman and Green Arrow resulting in the formation of Young Justice. In "Downtime", Aquaman tells Aqualad that he had learned what happened following the team's fight with Clayface from Batman (who deduced that Aqualad's homesickness for Atlantis is why the team was defeated). Aquaman ends up called away to help the Justice League with a fire breakout in California. In "Auld Acquaintace" Aquaman is controlled by Klarion and briefly fights Aqualad, but is defeated by his sidekick.

In Season 2, which is set five years after season 1, Aquaman is now partners with Lagoon Boy, and is crushed upon discovering that Kaldur'am has been corrupted and joined forces with his father Black Manta. Kaldur'am claims he could not trust Aquaman as he had kept the identity of Black Manta a secret from Kaldur'am. Aquaman states that it was a mistake, and tries to convince him that no one need suffer for it, but Aqualad angrily attacks his teacher. It is later revealed that Aqualad's corruption is truly a facade created so that he may infiltrate the supercriminal organization, the Light.

In Season 3, which is set two years after season 2, Arthur has given up the title of the Aquaman to Kaldur and looks more like his bearded appearance just with the addition of a crown on his head. He currently is just the king of Poseidonis as he chose to give up his heroism because his family needed him more.

Mad
Aquaman appears in the Mad episode "That's What Super Friends are For", trying to appeal to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called "Super Friends". He also appears on a skit called "Aquaman vs. Wild", voiced by John DiMaggio.

Teen Titans Go!
In the Teen Titans Go! episode "Matched", Cyborg creates a computer program that can tell a person who their romantic match is and when Starfire goes first, her perfect match turns out to be Aquaman. Starfire at first doesn't warm up to the idea of being with Aquaman, but then begins to fall for Aquaman after reading a magazine article about him and stares at a poster of him. Robin though tries to impress her by swimming 200 laps in the pool and then flexing his muscles to Starfire while in his bathing suit. He then creates a costume out of rotten fish like Aquaman, but it does not go so well due to the awful smell from the costume. Later, at Beast Boy and Raven's wedding, Starfire is seen sitting in the audience with Aquaman while Robin sits beside them, moping. Then, Cyborg shows up and tells them that there was a glitch in his match-making program and it turns out that Starfire and Beast Boy's perfect match is a scratching post. Starfire and Beast Boy then battle over the scratching post while Robin and Aquaman cry together after being rejected by Starfire. In "Don't Press Play", he is voiced by Greg Cipes. In "Finding Aquaman", he is voiced by Patrick Warburton.

Aquaman: King of Atlantis
A three-part miniseries titled Aquaman: King of Atlantis was produced by James Wan for HBO Max. Aquaman is voiced by Cooper Andrews. The series premiered on October 14, 2021, but was later removed from HBO Max in August 2022 alongside several other series due to the company's cost-cutting measures.

Harley Quinn
Aquaman appears in Harley Quinn, voiced by Chris Diamantopoulos. After appearing as cameo in "Finding Mr. Right", in "L.O.D.R.S.V.P", after Harley's crew steals jewels from Atlantis, he pursues them to the Legion of Doom's headquarters and beats up several villains while demanding them. Harley tricks him into breaking an aquarium, causing him to scoop up the fish and leave to take them to a body of water.

South Park
Co-creator Trey Parker voices Seaman, modeled after Aquaman from the Super Friends cartoon, is a member of the Super Best Friends, a superhero organization composed of prominent religious figures, Seaman being the exception. He is constantly mocked by the other team members, who pronounce his name "semen". This joke is intensified by Seaman's bird sidekick "Swallow" and Seaman's call: 'Swallow, come!". Also, the initials SM, printed on his chest, add to the sexual innuendo of the character.

DC Super Hero Girls
Arthur Curry appears in the episode, "#TheAquamanCometh", voiced by Will Friedle.

Live-action

Smallville
Arthur "AC" Curry appeared in an episode of the television series Smallville titled "Aqua". The episode features Arthur investigating the devastating effects on marine life from a project Lex Luthor has been developing for the U.S. military. He briefly dates Lois Lane before leaving to continue his fight for the ecosystem. Like his Filmation counterpart, this version of the character is shown to have the power to throw "water balls" having tremendous concussive impact and can also swim faster than Clark Kent. This version also wears an orange and green costume because he attends the University of Miami, whose team colors are green, orange, and white.

Arthur was played by former American Idol contestant Alan Ritchson. In an allusion to the HBO series Entourage, in which a successful Aquaman feature exists, when Arthur is asked which environmental group he is working for, he responds "I don't travel with an 'entourage'". "Aqua" was the highest-rated episode that season.

Ritchson reprised his role in the 2006 (season 6) episode "Justice", as a member of Green Arrow's unnamed superhero team. Along with Victor "Cyborg" Stone and Bart "Impulse" Allen, they fought to stop Lex Luthor from creating an army of superhumans. During this second appearance, he is using the codename "Aquaman", and wears a costume similar to his traditional one.

In episode one of season 8, Arthur, Black Canary, and Oliver are all searching for Clark who had disappeared after the finale of the previous season. They succeed in finding Clark, but Arthur and Canary are captured by Tess Mercer. In the end of the episode, Arthur severs ties to the other members of the team when their identities are compromised. He returns in the season 10 episode "Patriot" with his new wife Mera to help Clark save Oliver from Slade Wilson.

Aquaman pilot

The CW had announced a live action Aquaman television series, entitled Aquaman (also referred to as Mercy Reef), but in May 2006, The CW did not pick up the show for the 2006/07 schedule. Reports (beginning after the upfronts) said The CW was still considering Aquaman for midseason due to interest piqued by the leaked promotional trailer. The pilot episode is available at Apple's iTunes Music Store and is on the Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths Blu-ray as a special feature. It was also broadcast on Canada's YTV on June 9, 2007. It starred Justin Hartley as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, with supporting roles by Ving Rhames and Lou Diamond Phillips.

Peacemaker
Momoa made an uncredited cameo appearance as Aquaman in the Peacemaker season finale episode "It's Cow or Never".

The Big Bang Theory
Aquaman is frequently referenced in The Big Bang Theory, where the main characters often argue as to which superhero is better. One of them also dresses like him when going to a costume contest or for Halloween. During a panel interaction with the crowd at Comic-Con 2014, a member of the audience asked the writers of The Big Bang Theory why Aquaman sometimes got a bad rap at the show. After answering her question, they realized that the member asking the question was Marianne Norris, the granddaughter of Paul Norris, the creator of Aquaman.

A quest story in the spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Romancing the Stone and there would be a dynamic between Arthur and Mera start off as a love-hate relationship where they don't quite click and as time goes by and they try to work together they get closer and closer".

Injustice
Aquaman appears as a playable character in the Injustice video games by Neatherrealm Studios, with Phil LaMarr reprising his role from Young Justice. In the first game, he had downloadable alternate costumes based on his appearances in Flashpoint and Blackest Night.

In the first game, Aquaman is one of the Justice League members taken from the primary universe into an alternate world where Superman and his Regime rule over the planet. They are recruited by that world's Batman into the fight against the tyrannical Superman. In Aquaman's chapter in the story, he goes to Atlantis to learn more about the history of this alternate dimension in the midst of the alternate Aquaman's treaty negotiation with Flash and Shazam. When he discovers that the alternate Aquaman plans to register Atlantis under the Regime (thus giving Superman control over Atlantis), he becomes enraged at his counterpart's willingness to yield and defeats his alternate self as well as the Regime versions of Flash and Shazam before joining Batman's Insurgency to combat Superman. In the game's climax, the alternate Aquaman leads an Atlantean siege on Metropolis by High Councilor Superman's orders before he and the Atlanteans are stopped by the primary Superman and the Amazons. In his single player ending, he unites the world's oceans under the banner of Atlantis and gained a controlling interest in the planet's economy and ecology. The world's multinational corporations hired assassins to end his reign, but the world's citizens rose up in anger to those who would quell Aquaman's influence. After the threats desisted, a groundswell of support began for a United Earth under Aquaman's command.

In the second game, the alternate Aquaman initially refuses to help Batman combat against Brainiac's forces as he does not want to get dragged into another surface world conflict, but Green Lantern does convince Arthur to lend some of his Atlantean forces to help after Atlantis starts to become invaded by Brainiac. Eventually, Atlantis and its people become captured by Brainiac, with Aquaman managing to escape before he is caught with them. He volunteers to assist Black Adam in using the Rock of Eternity to take out Brainiac's defenses, as his trident would act as a suitable conduit to direct the Rock's power. They arrive in Kahndaq and are attacked by Grodd, who fights the two kings alongside the brainwashed Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Blue Beetle. Aquaman kills Grodd to avenge the Atlanteans abducted by Brainiac before he and Black Adam successfully lower Brainiac's defenses. On Brainiac's ship, Arthur is pleased to find out that Superman managed to restore Atlantis from Brainac's ship. In Batman and Superman's conflict over whether to spare Brainiac, he sides with Superman as he believes leaving Brainiac alive would be too risky and is fine with killing his enemies as it matches Atlantis' old fashioned sense of justice. He is defeated by Batman on the ship, as Batman puts Arthur out of commission by stabbing his leg with the Atlantean Trident. In his single player ending, Superman rises to power once again with Brainiac's death and Batman's defeat. Aquaman couldn't muster a force powerful enough to combat Superman to prevent the High Councilor from taking over Atlantis again. The Atlanteans discover a hidden Insurgency hideout underwater that contained Lex Luthor's interdimensional portal. After his scientists fix the portal, Aquaman uses it to travel to the primary universe from the first game to request their help in stopping Superman once again while also begging for their forgiveness.
