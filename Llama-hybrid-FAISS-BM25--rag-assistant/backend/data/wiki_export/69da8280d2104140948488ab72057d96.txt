China State Railway Group Co., Ltd., doing business as China Railway (CR), is the national passenger and freight railroad corporation of the People's Republic of China. 

China Railway operates passenger and freight transport throughout China with 18 regional subsidiaries. By September 2022, the total assets of China Railway Group are CNY 9.06 trillion (USD 1.24 trillion).

History 
Under the Chinese Corporate Law, China Railway Corporation was reorganized into China State Railway Group Co., Ltd. on June 18, 2019, instead of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People. This meant the Ministry of Finance would act as an investor on behalf of the state and the company would be led by a board and managed by board-chosen executives.

Logo 

The China Railway logo was designed by Chen Yuchang () (1912–1969), officially adopted on 22 January 1950. The whole logo represents the front of a locomotive. The upper part of the logo represents the Chinese character 人 (people), while the lower part represents the transversal surface of a rail. The logo means that China's railway belongs to the people. The lower part represents the character 工 (labour), means that China's railway belongs to the working class.

The "CR" logo is used on the Fuxing (train) along with the China Railway logo.

The "CRH" logo is used on the Hexie (train).

Services to Europe (New Silk Route)

 
 China Railway ran goods services to 15 European cities, including routes to Madrid and Hamburg and the experimental  East Wind service to London to test demand. The Chinese government refers to the two-week  route, starting at Yiwu and with trains to London traversing Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium and France, as the Belt and Road Initiative. Containers must be transferred several times, as different, incompatible, rail gauges are used in different regions, and the same rolling stock cannot be used throughout.
