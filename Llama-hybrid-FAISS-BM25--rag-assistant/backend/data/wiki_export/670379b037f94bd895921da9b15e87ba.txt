Ivan Georgievich Petrovsky () (18 January 1901 – 15 January 1973) (the family name is also transliterated as Petrovskii or Petrowsky) was a Soviet mathematician working mainly in the field of partial differential equations. He greatly contributed to the solution of Hilbert's 19th and 16th problems, and discovered what are now called Petrovsky lacunas. He also worked on the theories of boundary value problems, probability, and on the topology of algebraic curves and surfaces.

Biography 

Petrovsky was a student of Dmitri Egorov. Among his students were Olga Ladyzhenskaya, Yevgeniy Landis, Olga Oleinik and Sergei Godunov.

Petrovsky taught at Steklov Institute of Mathematics. He was a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences since 1946 and was awarded Hero of Socialist Labor in 1969. He was the president of Moscow State University (1951–1973) and the head of the International Congress of Mathematicians (Moscow, 1966). He is buried in the cemetery of the Novodevichy Convent in Moscow.
