Biography

Early life 
Joseph Burke was born in Buffalo, New York, to Joseph S. and Amelia (née Howard) Burke. The son of a boilermaker, he wanted to enter the priesthood since the age of six. He attended Canisius High School and Canisius College, both in his native city. He made his theological studies at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.

Priesthood 
Returning to Buffalo, Burke was ordained a priest by Bishop Charles H. Colton on August 3, 1912. During World War I, Burke was attached as an Army chaplain to the 91st Division of the US Army on the Belgian front. After the war, he served as a curate and pastor in the Diocese of Buffalo, and as a teacher at Mount Carmel Guild and at D'Youville College in Buffalo.

Auxiliary Bishop and Bishop of Buffalo 
On April 20, 1943, Burke was appointed titular bishop of Vita and the first auxiliary bishop of Buffalo by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on June 29, 1943, from Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, with Archbishop Thomas Walsh and Bishop Edmund Gibbons serving as co-consecrators.

He was the first native son of the diocese to become its bishop. His installation took place on April 30, 1952. During his 10-year-long administration, Burke gave his support to various groups, including the Holy Name Society, missions, the Pre-Cana program, Puerto Rican migrants, and displaced persons.
