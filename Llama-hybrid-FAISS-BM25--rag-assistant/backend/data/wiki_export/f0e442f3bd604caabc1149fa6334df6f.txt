WNBA career
Following her collegiate career, she was selected 11th overall in the 2005 WNBA draft. In her rookie season, Mann averaged 3.0 points and 7.7 minutes per game. In 2006, Mann was inserted into the starting line-up and averaged 7.4 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.

In 2007, Mann started 17 of the Lynx 34 games and posted career highs in scoring (7.6 ppg) and rebounds (3.6 rpg). On February 6, 2008, the Atlanta Dream selected Mann in their expansion draft. She was traded to Indiana midway through the 2008 season in exchange for Alison Bales.

While a member of the Indiana Fever, she played in five games averaging just over 6 minutes player per game and averaging 0.4 points per game. After the 2008 season, Mann was signed by the Washington Mystics, who cited her "ability to stretch the defense with her three point shot, a very high basketball IQ, and a competitive work ethic" as the reasons why they had chosen to bring her on board.

Former Lynx teammates Lindsey Harding and Eshaya Murphy joined Mann for training camping prior to the 2009 season. On June 4, 2009, Mann was waived from the Mystics, but she was re-signed on June 16, 2009.

Mann signed partway through the 2010 season with the Minnesota Lynx and would play a total of five games with them to finish out the season.
