Name
The name Miass is taken from the Bashkirs (), the indigenous inhabitants of these places, with the root of the word meaning "water" or "friend".

History

It was founded in 1773 as a copper mining factory. During the 19th century, the development was driven by the discovery of the richest gold deposits in the Urals. Average annual extraction of gold from the Miass region was about . In the mid-19th century, the volume of gold mining went down, and the development of Miass also slowed.
