History 
Prior to construction of the medical buildings near the site, the land was part of a Delaware Indian reservation.  By 1886 several buildings were completed, and the first interment was made. During the construction of one of the nearby medical buildings, the remains of twelve Native Americans were found.  They were re-interred in the cemetery.

This burying ground became part of the national cemetery system in 1930.  It is the location of eight Medal of Honor recipients, five of them honored for service during the American Civil War, and interments of other notable people.

In 1999 the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a component of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medical Center Historic District.
