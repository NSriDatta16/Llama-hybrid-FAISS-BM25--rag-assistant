"Everyday Is a Winding Road" is the second single from American singer and songwriter Sheryl Crow's 1996 eponymous album. Neil Finn, lead singer of Crowded House, provides backing vocals. Paul Hester, another member of Crowded House, was the inspiration for the song. The single was issued in the United Kingdom in November 1996 and was released in the United States the following year.

The single was well-received on the radio and peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and became Crow's fourth and final number-one single in Canada. The song received a nomination for Record of the Year at the 1998 Grammy Awards, losing to "Sunny Came Home" by Shawn Colvin. Billboard and The Guardian both named it as Crow's second-best song.

A music video for this song was directed by Peggy Sirota and filmed in New York City in sepia tone. It features a toy airplane flying from person to person throughout the city.

Criticism
Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said the song "blatantly swipes" from the Rolling Stones' song "Sympathy for the Devil".
