Clementi Secondary School () is a secondary institution in Fortress Hill, North Point, Hong Kong.  Founded by the 17th British Governor of Hong Kong Sir Cecil Clementi, the school was the first to use Chinese as the primary medium of instruction in Hong Kong.

History
The Governor of Hong Kong, Cecil Clementi, who had a profound interest in the Chinese language, decided to establish a school using Chinese as the main medium of instruction.  In 1926, Government Vernacular Middle School (官立漢文中學) was founded.  Government Vernacular Middle School is the first government school to use Chinese as the main medium of instruction. Li King Hong, the then-Chinese language inspector of schools, was appointed as the first principal of the school.

During World War II, the school suspended its operations under the Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong.  After the war, the school was renamed Government Vernacular Senior Middle School (官立漢文高級中學).  It was renamed again in 1951 to Clementi Middle School (金文泰中學) and in 1988 to Clementi Secondary School, after the governor.

The school has been relocated several times:

 1926-1927 26-28 Hospital Road (now site of Lok Sin Tong Leung Kau Kui College)
 1927-1941 Pok Fu Lam Road 
 1945-1946 Bridge Street (now Chinese YMCA of Hong Kong Bridge Centre)
 1946-1948 Wood Road (formerly Government Trade School Building c. 1937)
 1948-1961 28 Kennedy Road

It has been at the current site of 30 Fortress Hill Road since September 23, 1961.

The school principal is currently Mrs. Fung Lai Miu-yee, who succeeded Ms. Li Sui-wah in 2013.
