Strong Hand of Love: A Tribute to Mark Heard is a compilation of songs by various artists in tribute to songwriter, Mark Heard.

Recorded and released in 1994, after Heard's death in 1992. Proceeds benefit the Heard Family Fund.

In 1994, with Dan Russell as producer, the album was nominated for a Grammy in the Rock Gospel section.

In 1996, most of these tracks and many more were rereleased as the two-CD Orphans of God. One song, Phil Keaggy's version of "I Always Do", was replaced by his version of "Everything Is Alright". Two tracks were dropped completely for space on Orphans, "Castaway", by Bruce Carroll, and "How to Grow Up Big and Strong", by Rich Mullins.
