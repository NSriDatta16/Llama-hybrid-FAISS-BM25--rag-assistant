History

The chain was founded by a former partner of Papaya King, Nicholas Gray, in 1973, with its flagship, and as of 2023, only restaurant located at 2090 Broadway at 72nd Street.

In the June 1, 2006, issue of Time Out New York, Gray's Papaya's hot dog was ranked first over its competitors Papaya King and Papaya Dog. On March 3, 2008, The New York Times reported that Gray's Papaya had endorsed Democratic candidate Barack Obama in his campaign for the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election. 

The former Hell’s Kitchen location of Gray's Papaya (at Eighth Avenue and 37th Street) closed in 2011 and the Greenwich Village branch (on Sixth Avenue at 8th Street) in 2014 due to rent increases. For several years after, the flagship location at 72nd street was the only location left. 

In 2016, Gray's Papaya signed a 20-year lease for a new midtown location on Eighth Avenue, between West 39th and West 40th streets. The location opened in spring 2017 but subsequently closed in 2020 due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. After likewise shuttering their flagship location for the "first time in 47 years" on March 30, Gray's Papaya reopened the location in May 2020, with a new version of its "recession special" that featured two franks and a tropical drink for $6.95 including tax, with frontline healthcare workers eating the special for free. Thrillist listed it as one of the best hot dog locations in New York.

Gray died in May 2023 at 86 due to complications from Alzheimer's, but the restaurant continues to remain open.
