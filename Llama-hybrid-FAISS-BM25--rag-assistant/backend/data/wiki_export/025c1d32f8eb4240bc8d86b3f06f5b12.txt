Konami Cross Media NY, Inc. (formerly 4Kids Productions) is an American production company owned by Konami. It is located at 53 W 23rd St 11th floor, New York, NY 10010.

It was formerly a subsidiary of 4Kids Entertainment (which later became 4Licensing Corporation); the company was shut down on June 30, 2012, due to continued lack of profitability, but the production office was acquired by Konami and renamed 4K Media later that year. On April 1, 2019, the company's name was changed to Konami Cross Media NY, reflecting its expansion to manage Konami brands outside of video games. In addition to the localization and license management of intellectual property (IP), Cross Media NY will produce and develop new businesses with Konami's IP. 

Konami Cross Media NY is responsible for producing edited English-language adaptations of Japanese anime series, primarily of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise. The company is primarily dedicated to the licensing, sales, and distribution of the Yu-Gi-Oh! brand in the United States. The company also manages Konami's gaming properties, including Bomberman, Contra and Frogger; as well as Rebecca Bonbon, the girl's anime brand created by Yuko Shimuzu.
