New York's 7th congressional district is a congressional district for the United States House of Representatives in New York City. It includes parts of Brooklyn and Queens. Democrat Nydia Velázquez represents the district in Congress.

Like many Congressional districts around the country, the New York Seventh's boundaries were drawn as to link disparate and widely separated neighborhoods with a large percentage of minority voters (see majority-minority districts). While no minority in the district constitutes an absolute majority, the boundaries group together heavily Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.

The district includes the Queens neighborhoods of Long Island City, Astoria, Sunnyside, Maspeth, Ridgewood, and Woodhaven; the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bushwick, Clinton Hill, Downtown Brooklyn, East New York, East Williamsburg, Fort Greene, Greenpoint, and Williamsburg.

Until 2012, the 7th consisted of parts of Northern Queens and Eastern portions of the Bronx. The Queens portion included the neighborhoods of College Point, East Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside. The Bronx portion of the district included the neighborhoods of Co-op City, Morris Park, Parkchester, Pelham Bay, and Throgs Neck as well as City Island. Until the latest redistricting in 2022, the 7th also included a portion of Manhattan's Lower East Side.

List of members representing the district 

The 7th District originally was the south Queens seat in the 1960s and 1970s (now the 6th District) and then became a central Queens seat (essentially the old 8th district) in the 1980s. Following the 1992 remap, much of the old 9th District was added. The 2002 remap placed much of the district in the Bronx, and it now resembles the 1970s era 10th District.

Election results
Note that in New York State electoral politics there are numerous minor parties at various points on the political spectrum. Certain parties will invariably endorse either the Republican or Democratic candidate for every office, hence the state electoral results contain both the party votes, and the final candidate votes (Listed as "Recap").
