In mathematics, a recurrent point for a function f is a point that is in its own limit set by f. Any neighborhood containing the recurrent point will also contain (a countable number of) iterates of it as well.

Definition
Let  be a Hausdorff space and   a function. A point  is said to be recurrent (for ) if  , i.e. if  belongs to its -limit set. This means that for each neighborhood  of  there exists  such that  .

The set of recurrent points of  is often denoted  and is called the recurrent set of . Its closure is called the Birkhoff center of , and appears in the work of George David Birkhoff on dynamical systems.

Every recurrent point is a nonwandering point, hence if  is a homeomorphism and  is compact, then  is an invariant subset of the non-wandering set of  (and may be a proper subset).
