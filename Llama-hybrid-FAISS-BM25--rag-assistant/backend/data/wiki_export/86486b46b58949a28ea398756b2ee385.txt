History
Voters approved spending $2.3 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for construction of Triton Regional High School, the district's first facility. The school opened in September 1957 with a total of 980 students. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary during the 2006–07 school year.

In October 2012, five of Triton's faculty and administration were charged in having sexual affairs with students. Three teachers (Nick Martinelli, Daniel Michielli, and Jeffrey Logandro) were charged for actually having committed sexual misconduct, while two administrators (Principal Catherine DePaul and Vice Principal Jernee Kollock) were charged for covering up the incident. In wake of the teachers' firings, many different substitute teachers took the places of Logandro, Martinelli, and Michielli, Triton alumnus Daniel Mackie was appointed Interim Principal (in place of DePaul) for the remainder of the 2012–2013 school year, while Lynne Sireci was named interim 9th Grade Vice Principal (in place of Kollock) for the remainder of 2012–2013 until July 1, 2013. Starting July 1, 2013, longtime Black Horse Pike Regional School District employee and fellow Triton alumnus Melissa Sheppard was appointed Triton's new principal for the 2013–2014 school year and beyond, while current Triton Vice Principal Harold Little would take over the role as the Class of 2016's Vice Principal (the role Kollock had prior to her firing). Little would remain the Class of 2016's Vice Principal until their graduation in June 2016.
