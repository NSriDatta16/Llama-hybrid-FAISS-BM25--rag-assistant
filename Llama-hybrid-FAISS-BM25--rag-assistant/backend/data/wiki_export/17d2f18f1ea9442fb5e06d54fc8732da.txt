Kilkenny

Senior
On 9 December 2013, Lyng was appointed as a selector with the Kilkenny senior team under Brian Cody. He captured his first silverware as a selector on 4 May 2014 when Kilkenny defeated Tipperary by 2–25 to 1–27 to win the National League title.

Lyng won a second successive Leinster Championship as a selector on 5 July 2015 following Kilkenny's 1–25 to 2–15 defeat of Galway in the final.

On 4 August 2022, Lyng was appointed manager of the Kilkenny senior hurling team.

David Herity endorsed Lyng's appointment as Brian Cody's successor, telling Off the Ball AM that Lyng would be a diffent type of manager: "Derek would be nothing like Brian... Derek was always seen as one of the lads in the dressing room Brian approached before a match and gave a dig to and said, 'right get these lads going'. He was that kind of lad, along with a Noel Hickey or Henry [Shefflin]. He would have ticked a few boxes in what Brian Cody would look for in a player and leader. When Derek came in [as a selector], he was slightly the yin to the yang. James McGarry and Brian Cody would be similar enough in personality, stand-offish. They wouldn't show a massive amount of emotion or talk to players in that sense. Derek Lyng would've been the more friendly type".

Under-20
After stepping down as a selector with the Kilkenny senior team, Lyng was ratified as D. J. Carey's successor as manager of the Kilkenny under-20 hurling team on 14 October 2019.

Lyng got his team off to a great start in 2022 winning the Leinster Under 20 Championship over Wexford by one point. Lyng, followed this with All Ireland success as Kilkenny won the Under 20 Championship with a win over Limerick for the first time since 2008.
