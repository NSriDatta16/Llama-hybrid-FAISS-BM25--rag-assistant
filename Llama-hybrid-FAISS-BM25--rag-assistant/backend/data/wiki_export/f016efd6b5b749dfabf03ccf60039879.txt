One Foot in the Grave is a British sitcom, created and written by David Renwick and produced by the BBC, broadcast on BBC One throughout its run. The series features the exploits of Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson and his wife, Margaret Meldrew, played by Annette Crosbie, in their battle against the trials of modern life. Supporting cast includes Doreen Mantle as Jean Warboys, Angus Deayton as Patrick Trench, Janine Duvitski as Pippa Trench and Owen Brenman as Nick Swainey.

The series is regularly repeated on subscription channel Gold and has also been screened on Drama. While the programme has always been shown after the 9pm watershed on the BBC, other channels have sometimes broadcast it in earlier slots, with minor edits. It is available to stream on both BBC iPlayer and BritBox.

In addition, there were also two short specials (under ten minutes in length) for Comic Relief, one of which featured Richard Wilson (Victor Meldrew) alone, though it included at one point the voice of Paul Merton. The Comic Relief special in 2001 was set after Victor's death. Though Richard Wilson appeared, Margaret did not interact with Victor's ghost, being unaware of his presence, although she briefly complains about "cold air" beside her.

Some of the episodes did not feature the regular intro with the tortoise, such as "The Trial", "One Foot in the Algarve", "Rearranging the Dust", "The Wisdom of the Witch", "Starbound", "Endgame" and "Threatening Weather".
