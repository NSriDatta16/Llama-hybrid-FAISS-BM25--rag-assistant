The park then went to open nine new roller coasters in the 2000s and a further three in the 2010s, including a rebuilt Crazy Mouse roller coaster.

Copyright infringement controversy
In May 2007, the park was exposed by international media for having made unauthorized use of Japanese and American cartoon characters. According to a report originally broadcast on Fuji TV's FNN News, the park features a castle that resembles Disney's trademark Sleeping Beauty Castle and a structure that looks like Epcot's Spaceship Earth. The park also features a host of costumed characters that look remarkably similar to not only Disney's trademark characters, but also Shrek, Hello Kitty, Doraemon, Bugs Bunny and a number of other trademarked characters.

Park officials denied any wrongdoing. When asked by the FNN News reporter if the characters are related to Disney, the theme park's general manager Liu Jingwang said that their characters are based on Grimm's Fairy Tales.

According to a May 10, 2007, Associated Press report, the park deputy general manager Yin Zhiqiang said that the park's lawyers are in negotiation with The Walt Disney Company. Disney declined to comment directly on this matter.

Between 2010 and 2011, the park was expanded and refurbished. China Daily reports the Disney-themed characters may have been removed from the park.
