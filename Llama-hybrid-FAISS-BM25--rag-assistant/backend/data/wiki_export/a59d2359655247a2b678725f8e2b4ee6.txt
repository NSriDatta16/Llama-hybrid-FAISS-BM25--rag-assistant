Scarlet Fantastic were a British pop band active in the 1980s, consisting of Maggie K. De Monde and Rick P. Jones. The duo were former members of pop trio Swans Way, who had a hit with "Soul Train" in 1984. Scarlet Fantastic reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart only once, with October 1987 single "No Memory", a song which would become popular a few years later on the rave and Ibiza dance music scenes.

Since No Memory was a hit, De Monde has performed with her band The Mighty K, released the album Union as part of the duo Maggie & Martin, and has made guest appearances on various projects including Empire State Human and glean.

In 2016, Maggie De Monde resurrected the Scarlet Fantastic name with the release of her album Reverie and the Beyond Pluto EP. In 2021, Scarlet Fantastic released the singles "Better Day" and "Make Way For Love" (produced by HiFi Sean Dickson of The Soup Dragons) as tasters for a new album with tracks co-written with John L. Walters of 1980s band Landscape.
