Robert John Murdoch (November 20, 1946 – August 3, 2023) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and coach.

Early life
Murdoch was born in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, a mining community far from Southern Ontario in Timiskaming District. He grew up in nearby Larder Lake and played organized hockey in this area that saw many players go to the NHL, mainly playing on outdoor rinks. He went to the University of Waterloo where he received a double major degree in Mathematics and Physical Education. He was also captain for the Waterloo Warriors Varsity Ice Hockey team that played in the OUAA. Upon graduation, and undrafted, he played for the Canadian national team in 1968–69 and in 1969–70. He was one of many players affected by the withdrawal of the National Team from participating in the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships.

NHL Career
Murdoch played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, Atlanta Flames and Calgary Flames and coached 10 seasons in the NHL serving as head coach for Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets, and also serving as assistant coach for the Calgary Flames and San Jose Sharks. He won the Stanley Cup in 1971 and 1973 while with Montreal.

Coaching career
Murdoch coached 80 games with the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1987–88 season, compiling a record of 30–41–9. He was succeeded as Blackhawks head coach by Mike Keenan the following season.

During the 1989–90 season, Murdoch was named the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets. After missing the playoffs the previous season, the Jets went 37–32–11 for 85 points and third in the Smythe Division, making the 1990 Stanley Cup playoffs but losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion, the Edmonton Oilers, in seven games. Murdoch was seen as an important part of the Jets quick turn around, winning the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year.

Despite the success of the previous season, however, the Jets struggled in the 1990–91 season, finishing last in the Smythe Division with a 26–43–11 record, and missing the playoffs. Murdoch was fired at the end of the season and was replaced by John Paddock.

Murdoch would become an associate coach for the San Jose Sharks during the 1991–92 and 1992–93 seasons. 
Afterwards, he departed for Europe, and coached several teams in Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL), including Munich Mad Dogs, Cologne Sharks, and  Nurnberg Ice Tigers, retiring in 2002.

Later Life and Death
While he was proud of his Northeastern Ontario roots, Murdoch and his family spent summers near Lake of the Woods in Northwestern Ontario. In later years, Canmore, Alberta was home, where he was diagnosed in 2019 with Lewy Body Dementia, and died in Calgary, Alberta on August 3, 2023, at the age of 76.
