Overview 
Lake Millwood is mainly recognized for its fishing and birding access. It is also known for housing the 1,380-pound alligator, which was caught in the lake in 2012. Its  of submerged timber provide homes for the many varieties of fish in the lake, including the indigenous Millwood lunker largemouth bass. Other species of fauna around the lake include white-tailed deer, bobwhite quail, squirrel, dove, rabbit, raccoon, armadillo, opossum, fox, mink, American gator, and beaver. Boating is also popular on Millwood Lake, but only a small part of the whole surface area of the lake can be used as boating due to the submerged timber that takes up  of the pond. Lake Millwood also has a diverse flora life, with many plants and trees such as gum, oak, birch, pine, juniper, flowering shrubs, and wildflowers.

History 
The Millwood Lake project was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1946, and modified by the Flood Control Act of 1958. The dam and lake were designed and built by the Tulsa District of the Army Corps of Engineers, which still maintains the lake's Beard's Bluff recreation center. The projects construction work began in 1961, and was finished for flood control operations in 1966 at a cost of $44,000,000. The lake and dam were dedicated on December 8, 1966. The lake is the key in the general flood reduction system for the Red River below Lake Texoma.

Water use 

Benefits of the lake have been restoring wildlife, providing water to nearby areas, and preventing an estimate of $9,715,000 in flood damage. In Ashdown, Arkansas, the lake supplies Domtar's (formerly Georgia Pacific) Communications Paper Division with 50 million gallons of water each day for its operations.  The lake also provides drinking water to the city of Texarkana, Arkansas, through a water treatment plant located at Ashdown.
