In June 2004 Milan bought back 50% rights of Donadel for €800,000 in a four-year contract (Milan booked the contract value of Donadel was €4 million instead of €1.6 million, thus receiving €1.2 million financial income instead of costing Milan to write down the value of retaining 50% registration rights for €1.2 million.)
