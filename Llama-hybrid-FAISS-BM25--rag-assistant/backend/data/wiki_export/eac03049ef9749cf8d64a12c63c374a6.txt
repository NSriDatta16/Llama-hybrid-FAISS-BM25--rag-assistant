History
James Rowe arrived in South Australia 22 Apr 1837 on the "South Australian", spending two years on Kangaroo Island then settling with his family in the Ingle Farm area in 1848. They initially took up  in section 3030, Hundred of Yatala in 1849,  using the land primarily for farming wheat, barley, peas and hay. James Rowe's grandson, Jabez Sleeman Rowe (1871-1955), took on the farm and married Martha Barbara Wright (1868 - 1943), from Inglewood in 1902 consequently naming the farm Ingle Farm. In 1959, the South Australian Housing Trust purchased  from the Rowe brothers, Cyril (married to Alice) and Slem (married to Jean) Rowe and started a housing estate, with the first Housing Trust homes built in 1965 and 2,500 houses completed by 1975. The Rowe family name is preserved in the naming of Rowe Park, next to Ingle Farm Primary School, and Rowe Street in the adjoining suburb of Para Hills.

Sports
Rowe Park in the suburb's south, is home to the Ingle Farm Sporting Club. The club fields teams in Australian rules football, Cricket, Golf, Netball, Softball and some indoor sports. The club was originally known as the Ingle Farm Football Club, from its formation in February 1968, and was renamed in 1993. The football club first competed in the Central Districts Football Association, transferred to the Norwood-North Association in 1974, then to the South Australian Amateur Football League in 1978.

Walkleys Park in the suburb's north-east is home to Ingle Farm Amateur Soccer Club who take part in the SAASL Sunday Competition. The club was formed in 1973 and has played at Fairfax Road, Ingle Farm since 1979. Green and white have been the club's colours since its inception. The club currently has 7 teams: 1st Team, Reserves, C Team, C2 Team, C3 Team, Over 35's and Women's. IFASC has been successful in the past 13 years winning many trophies including SAASL Sunday Premier League, SAASL Division 2 and 3 leagues. The club also won the SAASL Challenge Cup in 2009 and 2015 beating more than 80 local clubs to the trophy.

In the 2006 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing, the population of the Ingle Farm census area was 8,474 people, in an area of 4.47 km2. Females outnumbered males 50.4% to 49.6%. Some 25.7% of the population was born overseas. Ingle Farm has experienced a decreasing population since 1996 resulting from few new houses being constructed and a general decrease in the average number of people living in each house.

Since its opening the enrolments steadily grew until it hit a peak of approximately 500 students in the late 70's and early 80's but currently is now only about 150. Ingle Farm Primary School (Belalie Road) was established in 1992 after the amalgamation of Ingle Farm Central Primary, Ingle Heights Primary and the old Ingle Farm Primary School.
