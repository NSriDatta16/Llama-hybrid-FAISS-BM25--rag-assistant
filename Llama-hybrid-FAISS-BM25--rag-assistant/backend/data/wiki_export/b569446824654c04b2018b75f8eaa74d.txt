Men's 
In the early years of the UAAP, the NU Bulldogs were a competitive team in the league, winning a title in 1954. However, by the 1980s, NU was perennially in the bottom ranking of the team standings. In the late 1990s, they improved their ranking by moving up to the middle of the team standings with now PBA stars Danny Ildefonso and Lordy Tugade in their team roster, but still failed to make it to the Final Four.

In 2001, the Bulldogs made a surprise trip to the Final Four. They were led by Jeff Napa who tied the record of UE's Allan Caidic for the most number of three-points made in a single UAAP game. However, they were not able to advance to the Finals as they were beaten by the La Salle Green Archers in their Final Four series.

After season 64 (2001–02), the NU Bulldogs returned to their mediocre performance despite having outstanding players such as Rey Mendoza, Edwin Asoro, both members of the Mythical Five in separate seasons and Jonathan Fernandez, who found some success playing for the PBL's Harbour Centre squad and the SEABA RP team.

In the last quarter of year 2008, the family of Henry Sy of SM Prime Holdings acquired majority ownership of the National University. Aside from improving school facilities, the new management has included in their corporate plan the improvement of NU's sports programs. After ten years, the National U Bulldogs made it again to the UAAP Final Four in 2012.

In the 77th season of the league, the NU Bulldogs made a dramatic and amazing title run. At the start of the season, they were at the top of the standings above ADMU and DLSU (teams that are expected to come out strong in the season). But in the 2nd round of the tournament, the Bulldogs fell on the 4th spot tied with UE Red Warriors. They faced UE on a Knockout Game for the 4th seed, which they won 51–49. They have beaten the 1st seeded team in the league which is the ADMU Blue Eagles in 2 Do-or-Die games, making them the 2nd 'Number 4' team in the UAAP History to defeat the Number 1 team. After 44 years, NU made it again to the UAAP Finals. They faced the FEU Tamaraws in three games. After 60 long years of title drought, the National U Bulldogs clinched the title after winning against FEU, 75–59,  in a Do-or-Die Wednesday, October 15, 2014, at the Smart Araneta Coliseum with a Record-Breaking Crowd of 25, 138 (biggest crowd ever to watch a basketball game at the venue, considering the game was held on a Wednesday).
