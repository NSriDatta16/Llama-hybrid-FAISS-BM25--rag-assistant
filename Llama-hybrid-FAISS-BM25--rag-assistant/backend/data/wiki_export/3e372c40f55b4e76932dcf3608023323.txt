Professional career

Cincinnati Bengals

Whitworth was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round (55th overall) in the 2006 NFL Draft. He made his NFL debut on special teams on September 10 against Kansas City. He started at left guard in the following week against the Cleveland Browns, as part of a line shuffle where left guard Eric Steinbach replaced injured Levi Jones at left tackle. Whitworth helped the Bengals pile up 481 yards against Browns, including 145 rushing yards by Rudi Johnson. He was in the starting lineup for Carson Palmer. He also had a key block on Rudi Johnson's seven-yard touchdown run in first quarter.

On July 25, 2008, Whitworth agreed in principle to a four-year extension worth a reported $30 million that would keep him in Cincinnati through 2013. He was ejected from a preseason game against the Jacksonville Jaguars after getting into a fight with Jaguars defensive end John Henderson. 

In 2009, head coach Marvin Lewis decided to move Whitworth from guard to left tackle and saw immediate impact. He started all sixteen games of the season, allowing just five sacks and helping running back Cedric Benson have a breakout year rushing for 1,251 yards. On December 12, 2010, Whitworth caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer against the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the first of his career, and he was the first Bengals offensive lineman to catch a touchdown pass since 1995.

He was ejected from a game against the Oakland Raiders after throwing a punch during a skirmish late in the game. He was subsequently fined $26,260 for the incident.

In January 2013, for the first time in his career, Whitworth was named a left tackle on the AFC Pro Bowl team.

During the 2014 season, Whitworth allowed zero sacks and only one hit on quarterback Andy Dalton. Due to his success, many pundits and experts have claimed that Whitworth was snubbed out of a second Pro Bowl berth, however, he was named second-team AP NFL All-Pro. He was voted as the 67th best player by his peers in the 2016 list.

Whitworth signed a one-year contract extension with the Bengals on September 26, 2015.

Los Angeles Rams
On March 9, 2017, Whitworth signed a three-year contract with the Los Angeles Rams. In his first season with the Rams, Whitworth made it to his fourth Pro Bowl. He was ranked 87th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.

In 2018, Whitworth helped the Rams reach Super Bowl LIII after they defeated the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round and New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship Game. The Rams lost to the New England Patriots 13–3 in the Super Bowl.

In the eighth week of the 2019 season, the Rams defeated the Bengals 24–10, giving Whitworth a victory over his former team. With that victory, Whitworth became only the 12th starter in league history to earn victories against all 32 NFL teams.

On April 1, 2020, Whitworth signed a three-year contract with the Rams. On November 16, Whitworth was placed on injured reserve, as he was carted off the field after suffering a torn MCL and damaged PCL in a 23–16 home win over the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10. He was placed on injured reserve the next day. He was activated on January 7, 2021, before the team's playoff game.

Whitworth was named the 2021 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year at the 11th Annual NFL Honors. Whitworth won his first Super Bowl in what would ultimately be his final game, after the Rams defeated his former team, the Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20 in Super Bowl LVI.

On March 15, 2022, Whitworth announced his retirement after 16 seasons.

Personal life
Whitworth is a Christian. Whitworth said he grew up as a Christian from a young age, but he lived mostly for himself. He said, "I had lots of success as an athlete, but my personal life was a wreck. I was unfaithful to women, my family, and most importantly to God. I thought I was strong and had everything together, but I was only fooling myself. I allowed guilt to control my life and cause me to make huge mistakes." After his second season in the NFL, Whitworth recommitted to his faith after going to church. "I fell to my knees and told God I was tired of running. I was ready to live the way He called me to. … I now live life with a new clear mind, whole heart, and a burning passion to spread Christ's love."

Whitworth and his wife, Melissa, have four children: twins Sarah and Drew, Michael, and Katherine. Melissa was the 2003 Miss Louisiana, an award-winning Louisiana reporter, and won Cincinnati's version of Dancing With the Stars.

Whitworth is active in the community through his BigWhit 77 Foundation. He hosts a fund-raising golf tournament in Louisiana and serves as a motivational speaker to youth groups in both Greater Cincinnati and in Louisiana.

In March 2020, Whitworth donated $250,000 to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank during the 2020–21 COVID-19 pandemic.
