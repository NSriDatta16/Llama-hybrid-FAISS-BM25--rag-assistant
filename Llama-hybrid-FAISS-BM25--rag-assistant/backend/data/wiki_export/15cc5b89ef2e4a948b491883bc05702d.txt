John Rodriguez (born May 16, 1941) is an American former professional wrestler. He has previously worked as a professional wrestler under the ring name Johnny Rodz.

Professional wrestling career

World Wide Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Federation (1965–1985)
He was part of the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) from its early years, appearing on WWWF cards as far back as 1965. He wrestled Bob Backlund in Madison Square Garden while working for the WWWF at the time. Dubbed the "Fire Brand From the Bronx" and the "Unpredictable", he was a proficient worker and a solid heel. Johnny would often tag with Jose Estrada, and Frank "the Gypsy" Rodriguez. For much of the next two decades through mid-1985, Rodz was a mainstay of the federation, though largely used as enhancement talent, for which he was praised by some of his peers. On August 9, 1980, at the Showdown at Shea, he was defeated by "Polish Power" Ivan Putski. His last WWF match was a loss to Gama Singh on June 19, 1985.

NWA Hollywood (1970s)
For a time, he also worked with Mike and Gene LeBell's NWA Hollywood Wrestling in the 1970s. He won a greater share of matches wrestling as "Arabian Wildman" Java Ruuk and even won the promotion's battle royal in 1976.

Post-retirement

In 1996, Rodz was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1996 by Arnold Skaaland.

On the March 1, 2007 episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Impact showed the Latin American Xchange (LAX) attacking Rodz as part of their feud with Team 3D. Ten days later at Destination X, he accompanied Team 3D to the ring for their Ghettobrawl match with LAX at the pay-per-view.
