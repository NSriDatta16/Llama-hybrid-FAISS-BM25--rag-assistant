He made his major league debut at the age of 30 with the California Angels on July 20, 1992, and appear in his final game on July 26, 1995. His last year in professional baseball was in 1998. He played until he was 36 years old, ultimately, venturing into scouting.

Primarily a relief pitcher during his professional career (1986–1997), his first major league win came in his second start. On July 25, 1992, Fortugno hurled a three-hit shutout against the Detroit Tigers, striking out 12.
