Seonjong of Goryeo (9 October 1049 – 17 June 1094) (r. 1083–1094) was the 13th king of Goryeo. He was the second son of Empress Inye and born in September, 1049. He was sealed as marquis of Gukwon (國原侯) in March, 1056. Harmony of Confucism and Buddhism made his political statue very stable. Also he propelled broad-range trade among Song, Jurchens, Liao dynasty of Khitans, and Japan.

During his period, Buddhism in Korea grew a lot. His brother Uicheon brought 1,000 scriptures from Song and bought 4,000 scriptures from Liao, Song, and Japan. Furthermore, Seonjong founded many pagodas for Buddhist temples and presented clothing for soldiers guarding the borders. Even when bedridden due to an illness in 1092, he calmly accepted his nearing death on lieu of Buddhist virtues.
