Roger Mudd's interview with U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was aired on a CBS Reports special, seen before Senator Kennedy's expected declaration of his candidacy and his challenge to U.S. President Jimmy Carter for the 1980 Democratic presidential nomination. In addition to questioning Kennedy about the Chappaquiddick incident, Mudd asked, "Senator, why do you want to be President?" Kennedy's stammering answer, which has been described as "incoherent and repetitive", as well as "vague, unprepared" raised serious questions about his motivation in seeking the office, and marked the beginning of the sharp decline in Kennedy's poll numbers.  One commentator, Anthony Lewis of The New York Times, wrote that Kennedy's answers were "stumbling, inarticulate, unconvincing" and "in general seemed to be those of a man unsure of the why's and where's in his life... unsure of who he was."   Kennedy said "The reasons that I would run are because I have great belief in this country, that it is— there's more natural resources than any nation of the world, there's the greatest educated population in the world... and the greatest political system in the world," and closed by saying "And I would basically feel that, that it's imperative for this country to either move forward — that it can't stand still — or otherwise it moves backward."  Analyst James R. Dickerson of the Washington Star quoted Kennedy and said that Kennedy "came to his interview... prepared to answer questions about Chappaquiddick and his marital problems but not about why he wants to be president and what he would do if elected."

November 5, 1979 (Monday)
