Born in Odell, Nebraska, the grandson of Irish immigrants, Callan graduated from Nebraska State Teachers College, now known as Peru State College. He served as an officer in the United States Navy during World War II on a destroyer in the Pacific Theater.

He was defeated for reelection to the Ninetieth United States Congress in 1966 by Robert Vernon Denney and lost a rematch to him in 1968.
