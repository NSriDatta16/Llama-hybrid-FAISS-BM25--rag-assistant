History
Knittlingen was founded during the Frankish period. Records from the year 843 refer to it by the name "Cnudelingen." It was a possession of various religious and secular territories, including the Margraviate of Baden, until it finally came into the possession of Maulbronn Abbey, which held it from that time forward.

In 1490, Maximilian I, established the first regular postal route in Europe between Innsbruck and the Netherlands. Knittlingen was used as a postal station in 1495 and 1499. It became a station once again in 1563, replacing Diedelsheim bei Bretten. Its use as a postal station brought many people to the town. The service station of the Thurn-und-Taxis-Post in Knittlingen reached the cities from Innsbruck to Brussels.

In 1360, in 1632 and again in 1692, the town was completely destroyed, having suffered greatly from being besieged, set on fire and sacked. Count Palatine Philipp set out from here on May 10, 1534, when he marched with his army to Lauffen to fight in the Battle of Lauffen. In 1632 during the Thirty Years War, Knittlingen was burned down by troops of General Ernesto Montecuccoli who fought on the side of the Empire. The important market road from Frankfurt am Main to Cannstatt via Speyer runs through the center of Knittlingen.

As a possession of Maulbronn Abbey, Knittlingen belonged to the territory of the Palatinate of the Rhine. Knittlingen received the official status of a city in 1840. Beginning in 1806, Knittlingen was part of the Maulbronn district, and from 1938 to 1972 part of the administrative district of Vaihingen an der Enz. After these districts were abolished, Knittlingen became part of the Enzkreis subdistrict in the Karlsruhe district.

The historical Faust, on whom the legends of Faust are based, was supposed to have been born here. Hence the city has a Faust archive and a Faust museum.
