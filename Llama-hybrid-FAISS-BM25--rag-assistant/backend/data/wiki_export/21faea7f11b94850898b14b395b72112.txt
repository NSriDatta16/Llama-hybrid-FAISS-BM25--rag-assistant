In 1998, Molloy sang the song "Black and White Army (Bringing The Pride Back Home)" written by Sting for the Newcastle's 1998 FA Cup final. However, after four years, his music career "just didn't work out".

On 31 October 2004, Molloy was chosen from 200 candidates as the new lead singer of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, appearing on 11 November in a special charity show for The Prince’s Trust at Wembley Arena celebrating Trevor Horn's 25 years as a record producer, performing live "Welcome to the Pleasuredome", "Two Tribes", and "Relax". Horn considered he "was a hell of a good frontman". He performed with them also in subsequent 2005 tour, and wrote some new songs for the band, but they weren't released as they disbanded in 2007.

He spent some time in 2005 also working with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics on the spoof documentary Platinum Weird, which involved Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani and Carmen Electra. They would collaborate again in 2019, when Molloy performed live "Thorn in My Side" and "Love is a Stranger" at Eurythmics Songbook concert at Royal Festival Hall.

On 1 and 3 June 2013 performed "Make Our Garden Grow" with Barbra Streisand at two The O2 Arena concerts of her Barbra Live tour. As was found out that the duet partners Il Volo cancelled on the day of the concert itself, Molloy was immediately called up with little time for rehearsal.

Molloy began his acting career in theatre appearing in a number of dramatic roles, including Los Angeles production of The Picked Cerebrum, and London productions of Betrayal and Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice and Macbeth. In 2003 starred in the West End hit Taboo, playing Steve Strange alongside Boy George and Lyn Paul. In 2004, he gained a chorus role in the controversial production of Jerry Springer – The Opera, where Molloy was a member of the original cast at the National Theatre, and went on to play the parts of the transvestite Tremont and the Angel Gabriel.

In June played Joilet Jake Blues in The Blues Brothers tribute musical Blues Brothers Unlimited at Centrepoint Theatre, Dubai. In August played in Eurobeat at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In September-October played as John the Baptist and Judas in Godspell, with theatre critics Mark Shenton and Sam Marlower praising his projection of charisma, being one of "few bright spots".

In October 2007, Molloy was cast as Frankie Valli in the West End premiere of Jersey Boys at the Prince Edward Theatre, and played his first preview performance on 28 February 2008, and official opening on 18 March 2008. His performance was received with critical acclaim, with Lyn Gardner writing in her critical review that "if it works at all, it is because Ryan Molloy carries all before him as the pint-sized Italian-American with the extraordinary falsetto", while Shenton praised it and that "the energetic evening's anchor, Ryan Molloy displays amazing emotional and vocal range". For his performance he received a Olivier Award nomination at 2009 Laurence Olivier Awards, and was voted by the public as the Best Actor in a Musical at the 2009 WhatsOnStage Awards. He remained with Jersey Boys for six years, with 2,500 shows as the lead by February 2014, leaving with the last show on 9 March 2014, making him the "longest-running star in a West End musical" and "longest-serving Frankie Valli". Molloy also provided vocals in the 2014 soundtrack (particularly "Beggin'") of the film version of the musical directed by Clint Eastwood, for which also auditioned but was chosen John Lloyd Young instead. He reprised the role in the Broadway production for a limited engagement lasting from July to October 2014 at the August Wilson Theatre, New York City.

Molloy finds inspiring helping new small-scale projects using his profile, working with young people on new ideas and writing. Shenton said that Molloy "set free at last from his Jersey Boys high notes – has matured nicely into the role of the Mephistopheles-like Hades", while Sam Marlowe that "Ryan Molloy is charismatic as Hades, a sinister music exec like a diabolical cross between Iggy Pop and Simon Cowell".

In last several years, Molloy founded Frankie and the Dreamers, a Frankie Valli-The Four Seasons tribute band, being a headliner for Royal Caribbean International and elsewhere. Molloy continued small-scale theatre performances acting in dramas The Tempest (2018), I Love My Wife (2018), Time Biter (2021-2023), and Julius Caesar (2023).
