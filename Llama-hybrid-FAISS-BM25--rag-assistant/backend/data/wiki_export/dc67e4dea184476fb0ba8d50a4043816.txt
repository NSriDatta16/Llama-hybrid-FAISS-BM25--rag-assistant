Fissure of the nipple, colloquially referred to as "jogger's nipple", is a condition that is the result of chafing of one or both nipples. This can occur in both men and women during physical exercise such as long-distance running where there is prolonged friction between the nipple and clothing. The issue is also commonly seen in surfers who do not wear rash guards or wetsuits.
