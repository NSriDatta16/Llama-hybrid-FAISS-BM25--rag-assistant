History
In 1910, Robert Ingersoll Ingalls, Sr. (1882-1951) founded Ingalls Iron Works in Titusville. (He later went on to found Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1938).

Since the early twentieth century Titusville has been a neighborhood of middle-class African American families, including architect Wallace Rayfield; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Freeman A. Hrabowski III, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Birmingham mayor William Bell; former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford; Birmingham city councillor Carole Smitherman; and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Harold Jackson.

In June 1993, Titusville residents took the Birmingham city government to court in an attempt to block completion by Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI) of a garbage transfer station in their community. This action succeeded in halting the project and was widely celebrated as a grassroots victory over environmental racism.  the city and county governments agreed to jointly purchase the former Trinity Steel Industries property in Titusville for redevelopment.

The neighborhood includes a high school, the Ullman High School, a public park, Memorial park, and several churches, including Westminster Presbyterian Church, where Condoleezza Rice's father and grandfather were pastors.
