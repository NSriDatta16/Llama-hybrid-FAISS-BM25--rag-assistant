Scott Strange (born 7 April 1977) is an Australian professional golfer who competes on the European Tour, OneAsia Tour and the Asian Tour.

Prior to turning Professional, Strange frequently represented the Western Australia amateur team in Australian Golf Union (now Golf Australia) events. He joined the Asian Tour in 2003 via Qualifying School, then had his first Asian Tour success in 2005, when he won the Myanmar Open. The following year he captured the Philippine Open.  Having performed well in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European Tour during 2007, Strange earned a place on the European Tour for 2008 through his position on the Order of Merit.

During his first season on the European Tour, Strange recorded his first win with a wire-to-wire victory at the Celtic Manor Wales Open, which lifted him into the top 100 of the Official World Golf Rankings for the first time. In April 2009 he won the Volvo China Open by one shot.
