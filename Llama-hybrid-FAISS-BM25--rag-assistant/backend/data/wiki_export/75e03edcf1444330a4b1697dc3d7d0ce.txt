Tommy Tenney (born 1956) is an American preacher and author, known for his message of "God Chasers".

In his book The God Chasers (1998), Tenney relates experiences of being "in the presence of God", including one occasion when a pulpit was purportedly divinely split in two. He teaches that every Christian should pursue an intimate relationship with God, and that supernatural occurrences are an ordinary outcome of the pursuit.

He has written over fifty other books and workbooks, including Hadassah: One Night with the King with Mark Andrew Olsen, which was made into a film titled "One Night with the King", in 2006.

He is the CEO of the GodChasers.net which holds offices in Pineville (Alexandria), Louisiana. GodChasers.net operates under its parent of HDE.

Three generations of ministry in his family heritage have given Tommy a rich perspective. He has a gifting to lead hungry people into the presence of God. He and his wife, Jeannie, understand the value of intimacy with God and humility in serving God's people.",

Tenney and his wife, Jeannie, reside in Louisiana. Tenney was raised in a Oneness Pentecostal denomination, the United Pentecostal Church International. His father, Rev. Tom F. Tenney (December 6, 1933 – June 1, 2018), held the position of District Superintendent of the Louisiana District United Pentecostal Church, since 1978. He held this position for 27 years until his recent retirement and re-launch into full-time mobile ministry. J.
