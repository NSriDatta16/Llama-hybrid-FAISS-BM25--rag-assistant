History
Lipik was occupied by Ottoman forces along with several other cities in Slavonia until its liberation in 1691.

In 1773, the warm waters of Lipik were described favorably by a Varaždin doctor. It continued to be used as a treatment spa for over a century, and in 1872, the first hotel was opened in the town. By 1920 the number of hotels grew to six. Spa treatment is still the major focus of economy for the town.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Lipik was part of the Požega County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

Climate

Lipizzan stable 

Lipik also hosts a Lipizzan stable that had been built in 1843 under the Habsburg monarchy. It had previously enjoyed state recognition in Yugoslavia between 1938 and the 1950s, when it was closed in favor of the stable in Lipica, Slovenia. It was reopened in 1981, but then during the Croatian War of Independence the horses were evacuated and taken to Novi Sad, Serbia, where they remained until their negotiated return in 2007.
