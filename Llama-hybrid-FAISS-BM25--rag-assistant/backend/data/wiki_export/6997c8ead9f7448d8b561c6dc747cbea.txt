Reception

Larry Levandowski of Armchair General said: "As a complete package, Commander – Europe at War, is a crowd pleaser. Strategy players at all levels of experience will enjoy this accessible game. Grognards looking for depth and historical accuracy may want to look elsewhere. But even grizzled veterans of the genre might fall for the game’s charms."

Neil Booth of PAL Gaming Network said that it's "[a]n excellent game for both hardcore strategy nuts and newcomers alike. An unassuming surface hides hours of ferociously addictive gameplay that's rivalled by few other titles."

Tuukka Grönholm of Pelit summarized: "Commander: Europe at War is a deep and fun strategy game that shines in multiplayer. The only problem is that Commander feels very much like Strategic Command, but it is not quite as good."
