Dominic Laurence Johnson (born October 31, 1975) is a St Lucian retired athlete competing in the pole vault. Early in his career he competed in the decathlon.

His personal best result is 5.70 metres, achieved in 2000. This is the current St Lucian record. He also holds the St Lucian records in decathlon, 110 metres hurdles, 4 x 100 metres relay and 4 x 400 metres relay. In 1998, Dominic established his national indoor record of 5.55 m in Flagstaff, Arizona. A graduate of University of Arizona, he has been described by then-coach Dave Murray as "the best all around athlete we've ever had at the university." Dominic, a past Sportsman of the Year recipient in St Lucia, won a silver medal for St Lucia at the 2008 CAC Championships in Cali, Colombia. In collaboration with journalist Terry Finisterre, Dominic also set up a College Athletic Scholarship Program which benefitted more than 30 St. Lucian athletes, one of who went on to become a 2004 Olympian.
