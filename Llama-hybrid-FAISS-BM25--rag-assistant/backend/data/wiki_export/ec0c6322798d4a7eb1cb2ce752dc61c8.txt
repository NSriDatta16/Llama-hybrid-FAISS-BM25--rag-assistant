Education 
Caspar Berry was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, before reading economics and then anthropology at Cambridge University.

Early career 
During his A levels, Berry was selected for the lead role, Gill, in the first two series of the BBC series Byker Grove. Berry also appeared in the Emmy Award winning film The Black Velvet Gown, the BBC television drama Spender and the British comedy film Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis.

Berry also wrote for a number of television dramas, including Hollyoaks and Byker Grove.
