Scouting in Western Australia is predominantly represented by a branch of Scouts Australia and Girl Guides Western Australia, a member organisation of Girl Guides Australia.

Scouting began in Western Australia in 1908 when eighteen-year-old Frank Roche from Spearwood established the first Scout Patrol. By the end of 1909 there were 416 members in 16 groups. In 1912, the Founder, Robert Baden-Powell visited Perth.

Girl Guides started in Western Australia in 1915 in a very formal way when the Women's Service Guild staged a public meeting, under Vice Regal patronage, in the Perth Town Hall on 28 June 1915. The Governor moved, "That a Girl Guide Association be formed in this State and that we apply to the Girl Guide Association of Great Britain for a warrant".
