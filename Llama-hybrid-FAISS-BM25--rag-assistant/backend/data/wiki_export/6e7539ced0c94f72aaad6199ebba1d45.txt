History
Port Rowan's earliest known inhabitants, from around the year 1000 until approximately 300–350 years later, were the Algonquin nation. They were noted flint-workers and evidence of the skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the hamlet. The next wave of inhabitants were the Attawandaron nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the Iroquois in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the Mississaugas.

Key buildings, including John Backhouse`s mill, that date back to the 18th century, remain in existence today.
During the War of 1812 American soldiers burned all the mills on Lake Erie`s north shore, from the St Clair River to the Grand River, except for the Backhouse mill, and one other.
According to Ron Brown, in ″The Lake Erie Shore: Ontario's Forgotten South Coast″, Backhouse`s mill was skipped due to powerful connections within the USA.

In 1850 the town processed  of timber.  1850 marked the beginning of shipbuilding in Port Rowan.

With the decline of the fishing, lumber and milling industries, tourism is the main economic activity in the region.

Port Rowan is home to the headquarters of Birds Canada (formerly Bird Studies Canada), the country's only national bird conservation organization.

On June 30, 2018, Port Rowan officially lost their only bank for business and personal transactions. Calls to Tillsonburg are considered to be long-distance to Port Rowan residents so that banking by phone simply isn't an option. The majority of the retirement population must choose between maintaining a vehicle on the road or having Internet access due to old age pension payments not matching up to the rising cost of goods and services. All the small businesses were not equipped to deal with Internet banking and may face significant financial difficulties in the future. Online banking has gained popularity in both urban and rural areas due to its fast and reliable service. The Long Point Country Chamber of Commerce was attempting to attract a credit union in the town similar in nature to Tangerine but to no avail. Meanwhile, the well-established banks are removing their presence away from the rural communities of Ontario at a fast pace. Places like Service Ontario and the Backus Heritage Conservation Area are destined to face some form of setbacks as a result of the bank closure and may have to stop operating; leading to an almost-immediate loss of jobs in the area.

It was suggested that Port Rowan was going to experience Internet speeds and a level of reliability that is roughly comparable to Delhi by the year 2020 thanks to an underground cable system. This underground cable system would be similar to those found in communities like Langton, Courtland, and St. Williams, giving reliable broadband Internet access that was not normally found in the area during the start of the 21st century. There are plans to eventually the entirety of Southwestern Ontario into some form of high-speed Internet/cable television service sometime within the next 30 years.

Climate
From the late 1990s onwards, winters became more mild due to changes in climate brought on by global warming. Port Rowan traditionally belongs to the humid continental climate zone, even with the recent mild winters and warmer dry summers. Like in all communities, towns, and cities throughout the world, global warming due to human industrial activity has drastically altered the climate of Port Rowan throughout the decades.

Port Rowan's first mild winter since Confederation occurred in the year 1975. The warmest summers that Port Rowan has witnessed occurred in 1998, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 (with the exception of the month of July), 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Should the sea levels rise by , Port Rowan would not be affected by flooding. However, it may be affected by droughts as a by-product of the dislocation of available freshwater and may be forced to rely on desalinated salt water piped in from the Eastern United States. Constructing the proper infrastructure to carry the water hundreds of miles away would take considerable manpower along with significant economic costs and an unprecedented level of cooperation from multiple federal, state/provincial, and municipal governments.
