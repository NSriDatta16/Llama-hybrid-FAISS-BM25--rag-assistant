Music video
The video features Ne-Yo and his girlfriend on a beach-like area. His girlfriend continuously shown to be angry at him, as different girls who see him are flirting with him. Ne-Yo also invites his girlfriend to a photo shoot, but she ends up getting mad because the photos require him to have women draped over him. At the end, his girlfriend is shown angry again. Ne-Yo gives the camera a wink and makes his way over to her. Throughout the video, during the pre-chorus and chorus, the video shows various women (and one little girl) expressing anger.
