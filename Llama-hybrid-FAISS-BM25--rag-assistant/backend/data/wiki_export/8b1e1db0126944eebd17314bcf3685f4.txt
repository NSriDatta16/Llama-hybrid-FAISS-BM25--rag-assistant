Nagar Valley once a princely state, now stands as one of the ten districts within the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan..  This valley is situated along the renowned Karakoram Highway, as one travels northward from the city of Gilgit. The valley is home to many high mountain peaks including Rakaposhi (7788m), Diran Peak (7265m), Golden Peak and Rush Peak.

The Nagar valley is administratively divided into two tehsils: Nagar-I and Nagar-II. All the villages of upper Nagar including Shayar, Askurdas, Sumayar, Nagarkhas, Hoper Valley, and Hispar come under Nagar-I, whereas the villages of lower Nagar including Chalt Paeen, Chalt Bala, Sonikot, Akbarabad, Rabat, Bar, Buddalas, Chaprote, Skandarabad, Jafarabad, Nilt, Thol, Ghulmet, Pisan, Minapin, Meacher, Dadhimal, Phekar, and Hakuchar are part of Nagar-II. Burushaski and Shina languages are predominantly spoken in the valley.

The Rush Lake, the highest alpine lake of Pakistan and the 27th highest lake in the world, also lies in this valley.

Geography 
The topography of the Nagar Valley is characterized by hills and mountains, making it a mountainous region overall. However, the valley's terrain is such that all parts of it are readily accessible. The Karakoram mountain range envelope the entire region, including the Rakaposhi peak. Of the total area of the Nagar valley, 90% is above 3,000 meters above sea level and 30% is 5,000 meters above sea level.

History

Nagar was an independent principality for more than 1,200 years. The British gained control of Nagar during the Anglo-Brusho war, locally known as Jangir-e-Lae. Jangir-e-Lae was fought between the people of Nagar state and the troops of the British Raj at Nilt from 1 to 23 December 1891.

The British troops faced intense resistance from the people of Nagar under the leadership of the Tham (Chief) of that time, Azur Khan, at the Nilt Nallah (known as Jamila Mo Har).
The people of Nagar fought bravely for more than 20 days but were defeated due to a lack of armaments. Over 100 Nagar lost their lives and 127 were imprisoned. On the British side, four British officers and over 50 Dogra levies lost their lives. The British retained Nagar's status as a principality. Even after the revolt against the Maharaja of Kashmir and unconditional accession to Pakistan in 1948, Nagar's status continued to be that of a princely state.

During the 1960s, people start protesting against the despotism of the Mir, demanding the abolition of Begar and reduction in taxation. In 1970, they organized a march to Gilgit to register their demands authorities, while Gilgit sent scouts against the people. The scouts opened fire on the demonstrators in Chalt, killing nine people and wounding many more. The leaders of the protest were imprisoned. Later, on 25 September 1974, Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto dissolved the princely states of Nagar and Hunza, set the prisoners free and gave democratic representation to the Northern Areas Council, now the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly.
