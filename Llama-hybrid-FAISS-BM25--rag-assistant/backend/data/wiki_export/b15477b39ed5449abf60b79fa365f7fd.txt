The Chambal Garden is located in southeastern Rajasthan, India on the banks of the Chambal River in the town of Kota (once part of the Rajput kingdom).

The well-groomed garden's centerpiece is a pond replete with gharials, which used to house magars as well. The pond can be crossed via a suspension bridge or by boat to allow a closeup view of the fish-eating reptiles.

Some scenes of the 2017 Bollywood film Badrinath Ki Dulhania were also shot here.
