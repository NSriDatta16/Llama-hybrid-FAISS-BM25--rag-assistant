WWF Full Metal: The Album is the first compilation album released by WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation, or WWF) in October 1995 by Edel Music. It features a selection of theme tunes of wrestlers on the roster at the time, and is considered to be Volume 1 of the WWE: The Music series. The album was reissued outside North America as WWF Champions: The Album â€“ Full Metal Edition on September 24, 1996.

The album was named after the European WWF Full Metal Tour in October 1995, and commercials in Germany for the album were aired featuring Diesel and Razor Ramon.

Critical reception

Steve Huey awarded WWF Full Metal: The Album three stars out of five, calling it "the perfect supplement for hardcore fans."
