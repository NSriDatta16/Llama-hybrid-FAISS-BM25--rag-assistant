is a national park in the Chūbu region of the main island of Honshū, Japan formed around several active and dormant volcanoes. It spans the  mountainous areas of Gunma, Nagano, and Niigata prefectures. The name refers to the two mountain ranges that make up the park. It was divided into two separate areas: the Southern Niigata/North Nagano Area and the East Nagano Area.

History
Jōshin'etsu-kōgen National Park was established in 1949 and significantly expanded in 1956 to include the Myōkō-Togakushi mountainous region. The latter was separated as Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park on March 27, 2015 with 39.772 ha.

Etymology

The name of the park consists of two elements. The first, "Jōshin'etsu", is a kanji acronym consisting of three characters which represent the former names of provinces of the area:  in present-day Gunma Prefecture,  in present-day Nagano Prefecture, and  in present-day Niigata Prefecture. The second, "kōgen", means tableland or plateau.

Southwest Mikuni Mountain Range Area

 includes Mount Tanigawa () and two active volcanoes -- Mount Kusatsu-Shirane () and Mount Asama (). Mount Asama is the most active volcano on Honshū.
