Incilius fastidiosus, or the Pico Blanco toad, is a species of toad from western Panama and southeastern Costa Rica. It inhabits premontane and lower montane rainforest. It is largely a fossorial species that breeds explosively in temporary pools after heavy rains in late Aprilâ€“May. Juveniles occur on rocky stream margins the year round.

It is listed as a critically endangered species due to a drastic population decline, probably caused by chytridiomycosis, and to some extent, habitat loss.
