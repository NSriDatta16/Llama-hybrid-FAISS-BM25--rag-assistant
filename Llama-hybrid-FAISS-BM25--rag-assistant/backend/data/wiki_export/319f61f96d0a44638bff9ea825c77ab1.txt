Kala Suri Parakrama Kodituwakku, is a notable Sinhala poet. After the revival and experimentations of Sinhala poetry during the 1950s and 1960s, the 1970s were marked by the rise of several young poets including Parakrama Kodituwakku, Monica Ruwanpathirana and Rathna Sri Wijesinghe. His "Podi Malliye" (1972) was praised by critics and after "Otunna Hini Kumaraya" (1975) he didn't publish anything new until the 1990s except several poems in newspapers.
