Boland is a first-class cricket team that nominally represents the Boland region, in the South African province of Western Cape, in the CSA Provincial Competitions. The team is selected and supported by the Boland Cricket Board (BCB) and plays its home games at Boland Park in Paarl. At organisational level, the BCB is responsible for the administration and development of cricket in the region and among its primary functions are management and promotion of the Boland team. The current BCB was founded in 1992 as a merger between the Boland Cricket Union and an earlier Boland Cricket Board.

Team history
Boland began playing in first-class matches in October 1980. They began in the lower (B-province) level of the first-class competitions but were raised to A-province status in 1994. To take part in the SuperSport Series, the Boland side merged with Western Province to form Western Province Boland (now Cape Cobras) from October 2004. Since 2004, Boland have competed in the CSA Provincial Competitions. As of late November 2022, they have played 348 first-class matches with 82 wins, 143 losses, 120 draws and three ties. 

Among South African international players who have played for Boland have been the 2007 national player of the year, pace bowler Charl Langeveldt, who was with the Boland team throughout his domestic career from 1997 to 2013, and the all-rounder Justin Ontong played for Boland for nearly twenty years to 2017.
