History

Controversies
In 2013, 12 students were suspended for a semester for using marijuana and breaking curfew on a school trip. The punishment was appealed by some parents and received a small amount of national news coverage.

Curriculum
In 2015, the sustainable agriculture program was expanded with the purchase of the SSS Farm. Students are able to grow food for a community-supported agriculture program. Participation in the program is worth four course credits, the same amount as a standard class. The program was developed with support from the University of the Fraser Valley, a university local to Chilliwack and Abbotsford.

With the end of the 2023 school year, the 20+ year old Computer Science program was shut down due to the lack of any available Computer Science teachers in British Columbia.

Awards and Accomplishments 
In 2022, the Drumline placed third in the BC Provincial Championships, hosted by the Canadian Drumline Association, losing only to MEI and Collingwood.
