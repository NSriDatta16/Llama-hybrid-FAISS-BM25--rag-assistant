Talon's first book, Panel Discussions from TwoMorrows Publishing, is an overview of techniques for developing sequential art. It has been described as "indispensable reading for anyone interested in the subject of sequential art."

His second book, Comics Above Ground, also from TwoMorrows Publishing, features top comics professionals talking about their inspirations and training from the comics profession and its effects in "Mainstream Media," including: Conceptual Illustration, Video Game Development, Children's Books, Novels, Design, Illustration, Video Game Animation, Motion Pictures and other media.

His artwork has been featured on the covers of Batman ("Officer Down"), Skinwalker, and Queen & Country. A review of Skinwalker No. 3 commented that "[t]he covers by Durwin Talon are a wonderful blend of pastel and oil that prompt you into wishing we could read a whole book that looks like this."

He has contributed artwork for Marvel Comics and DC Comics as well as worked on games and trading cards for Upper Deck, White Wolf, Inc. and Wizards of the Coast.  His sequential artwork has been accepted into the Society of Illustrators' 49th Annual Exhibition.
