He debuted in Divizia A with FC Olt Scornicești in 1984. He went to Dinamo București in 1991, and helped Dinamo win the title in his debut season. In 1995, he was bought by French club En Avant Guingamp where he spent almost four seasons. Following the relegation of Guingamp in 1998, Mihali eventually returned to Dinamo București where he lifted the Romanian cup titles in 2000 and 2001 before retiring as a player.

Mihali made his debut for the national team in 1991 against Egypt, and earned 31 caps in total. He was in the squad for the 1994 World Cup and Euro 1996.

His first full job came in 2007, when Mihali was installed as head coach to CSM Focșani. After 15 games and only 13 points won, Mihali quit the Liga II squad. He didn't stay without a contract for too long. In October 2008 he was named head coach at Universitatea Cluj, where he took over from Dorinel Munteanu, who left for Steaua București. He was sacked in April 2009, because he was questioned by the fans.
