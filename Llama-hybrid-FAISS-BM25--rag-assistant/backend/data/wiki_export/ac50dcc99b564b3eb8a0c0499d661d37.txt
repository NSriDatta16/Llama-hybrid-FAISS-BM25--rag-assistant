Belledune is a port village in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It has a population of 1,325, and straddles the boundary between Restigouche County and Gloucester County, New Brunswick.

The community of Belledune was created through the amalgamation of Jacquet River, Armstrong Brook, and Belledune in 1994. The community dubbed itself a "Supervillage" after this amalgamation. Belledune's population meets the requirements as a "Town" under the Municipalities Act of the Province of New Brunswick, but it has not requested a change in municipal status and therefore remains as a village.

Belledune is one of the few municipalities not significantly affected by the province's 2023 local governance reforms.

History 

The village was first settled by François Guitard around 1815. Guitard was originally from France, and after fighting in Napoleon's army he defected to the British Army.
