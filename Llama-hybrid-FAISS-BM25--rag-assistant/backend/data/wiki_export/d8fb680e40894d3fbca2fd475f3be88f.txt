B.A.T. II â€“ The Koshan Conspiracy is a futuristic point and click adventure game written by Computer's Dream and published by Ubi Soft in 1992. It is the sequel to the 1990 game B.A.T.

It is a futuristic role-playing game in which the player explores the city, talks to non-player characters, tries to solve puzzles, travels to new cities by use of a mini-game, buys weapons and ammo, engages in fire fights (also by way of a mini-game), buys a spaceship, and enters space. The player can even re-wire a wrist computer (B.O.B) in the game to perform different functions. It has a very open, non-linear play style.

The Amiga and Atari ST versions shipped with a physical dongle to prevent piracy.

The box art was painted by Luis Royo.

Reception
Computer Gaming World stated that Koshan "was clearly a superior product" to its predecessor, with a much larger game world and both strategic and action combat options. The magazine concluded that it was "an enormous game, offering a richly textured, futuristic gameworld that gamers can find themselves easily drawn into".
