Grunters or tigerperches are ray-finned fishes in the family Terapontidae (also spelled Teraponidae, Theraponidae or Therapontidae). This family is part of the superfamily Percoidea of the order Perciformes.

Characteristics
The Terapontidae is a large family of small to medium-sized perciform fishes which occur in marine, brackish and fresh waters in the Indo-Pacific region. They are characterised by a single long-based dorsal fin which has a notch marking the boundary between the spiny and soft-rayed portions. They have small to moderate-sized scales, a continuous lateral line reaching the caudal fin, and most species lack teeth on the roof of the mouth.  The marine species are found in inshore sea and brackish waters, some species are able to enter extremely saline and fresh waters. In Australia and New Guinea there are a number of species restricted to fresh water.
