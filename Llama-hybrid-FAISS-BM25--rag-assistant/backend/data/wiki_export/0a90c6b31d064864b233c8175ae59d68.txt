The Shyness Clinic is a clinic founded in the late 1970s by Dr. Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University. Its goal is to research cognitive traits in people with shyness and to offer treatment programs for those specific impairments. It was later moved to the community of Palo Alto, California. The clinic follows a "social fitness model", which encourages people to exercise socially.
