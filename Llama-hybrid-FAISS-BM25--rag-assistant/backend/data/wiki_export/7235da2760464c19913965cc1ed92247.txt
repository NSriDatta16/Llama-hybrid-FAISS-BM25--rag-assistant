Francis Hargrave (c.1741–1821) was an English lawyer and antiquary. He was the most prominent of the five advocates who appeared on behalf of James Somersett in the case which determined, in 1772, the legal status of slaves in England. Although the case was Hargrave's first, his efforts on the occasion secured his reputation.

Life
Hargrave was born in London, the son of Christopher Hargrave of Chancery Lane. He entered as a student at Lincoln's Inn in 1760.

He came to prominence because of his performance in 1772, in Somersett's case, and shortly afterwards was made King's Counsel. Thereafter, he specialised in legal history and commentary and did not take further part in the abolitionist campaign. In 1797 he was made Recorder of Liverpool, and for many years was treasurer of Lincoln's Inn and a leading parliamentary lawyer.

He continued the celebrated compendium of State Trials begun by Thomas Salmon and Sollom Emlyn, which was later expanded by Thomas Bayly Howell.

He fell ill, in 1813, and his legal collection was purchased by the government for £8,000 and deposited in the British Museum. He died in 1821 and was buried in the chapel of Lincoln's Inn.

Works
He published many works of legal history and amassed a substantial collection of legal books and manuscripts. His works were:
