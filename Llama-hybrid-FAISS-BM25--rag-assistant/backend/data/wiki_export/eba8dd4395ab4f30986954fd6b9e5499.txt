The aims of the Football Australia Hall of Fame (founded in 1999 as the Soccer Hall of Fame) are to celebrate and highlight the achievements of retired players and other participants who have contributed significantly to the game. These are made up of either Australian and/or non-Australian footballers, managers and other participants who have become significant figures in the history of the game in Australia. New members are generally added each year.

Selection
All nominees must be Australian citizens. For non-players, inclusion is based on criteria including and "overall sustained contribution to the game".

Awards
Originally, there were several categories based on the nature of an individual's contribution, including:
 Hall of Champions (players) / Hall of Honour (non-players)
 Medal of Excellence (players) / Roll of Honour (non-players)
 Award of Distinction (players) / Roll of Honour (non-players)
