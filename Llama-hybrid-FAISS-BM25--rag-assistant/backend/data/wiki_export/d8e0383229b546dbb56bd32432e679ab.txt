The KL Sports City (formerly known as Bukit Jalil National Sports Complex; Kompleks Sukan Negara in Malay) in Malaysia is the largest sports complex in the country. It is located in Bukit Jalil, 20 km south of Kuala Lumpur. Described as the "sports complex in a park", it was the only one of its kind in the country or region when it was fully developed. It was officially inaugurated by the then-Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad on 11 July 1998 ahead of the 1998 Commonwealth Games in which it staged the Games' opening ceremony. The complex was upgraded to KL Sports City in 2017 for the 2017 Southeast Asian Games.
