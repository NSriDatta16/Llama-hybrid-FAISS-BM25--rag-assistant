Rocky Island is an island in Walsh Bay just south of the Archer Point Light about 25Â km south-east of Cooktown in the Australian state of Queensland. A lighthouse on the island, now disused, served as a lead, together with Archer Point Light, between Hope Islands and the mainland to the south, and between some reefs and the mainland to the north. It is around 6 hectares or 0.06 square km in size.
