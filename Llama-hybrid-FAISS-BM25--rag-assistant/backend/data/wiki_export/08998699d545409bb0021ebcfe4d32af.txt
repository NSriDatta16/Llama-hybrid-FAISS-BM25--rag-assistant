PA 5 Alternate

Pennsylvania Route 5 Alternate is a  alternate route that is located in Erie County in Pennsylvania. In 1955, the designations of mainline and alternate Routes 5 were switched. The route begins in suburban Millcreek Township, where its parent route passes near Erie International Airport.

It then passes through a heavily suburbanized and residential two-lane sector, before serving as portions of 8th and 6th Streets in Erie city. Passing relatively close to the lake, it travels through several picturesque tree-lined streets of large homes, skirting the city center and industrial areas. Near its eastern end, it is four lanes and divided, with a parkway-like setting formed by the tree-lined median.

Almost immediately after entering the suburb of Lawrence Park Township, the route ends at its parent.
