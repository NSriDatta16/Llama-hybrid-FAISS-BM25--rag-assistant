Panago is a privately held Canadian pizza delivery and takeout chain with approximately 200 locations across six provinces. It was founded in 1986 by the Rooke family.

History
The first three stores opened in 1986 in Abbotsford, British Columbia, and operated under the brand "Panagopoulos 2 for 1 Pizza Place". The chain's name was soon shortened to "Panagopoulos Pizza Place", then later to "Panagopoulos", and then finally to "Panago" in 2000.

The Panago head office is in Abbotsford and there is a regional office in Downtown Toronto. By the late 2000s, expansion efforts were heavily focused in the province of Ontario. The first urban Toronto location opened at Bay and Gerrard in April 2007.
