Joseph Henry Delaney (25 July 1945 – 16 August 2022) was an English author best known for his dark fantasy series, Spook's. Initially embarking on a career as a teacher, Delaney also penned science fiction and fantasy novels for adults under the pseudonym J. K. Haderack. He later transitioned to writing under his real name, beginning with the publication of The Spook's Apprentice, in 2004. This marked the start of his widely successful Spook's series, which eventually encompassed 19 books along with several others set in the same universe. In 2014, The Spook's Apprentice was adapted into both a play script and the feature film Seventh Son. Additionally, Delaney published two other series: the science fiction-themed Arena 13 and the dark fantasy Aberrations.

Life and career
Joseph Henry Delaney was born on 25 July 1945 in Preston, Lancashire, the son of a labourer; he was the oldest of four children. Delaney attended Preston Catholic College and then worked as an apprentice engineer and fitter. He took his A-Levels at night school before studying  English, history and sociology as a mature student at Lancaster University. Following graduation, he studied at St Martin's College to become a teacher. He later became an English teacher at the Blackpool Sixth Form College, where he helped start the Media and Film Studies Department. In the 1980s Delaney completed an Open University degree in an effort to become a computer programmer. In 1983, he moved to the village of Stalmine, where he discovered that, in the past, a boggart had been found there by a priest; he noted this down and the finding later became the source of the Spook's series.

Delaney's first works were written under the pseudonym J. K. Haderack; a reference to the Kwisatz Haderach from Frank Herbert's Dune universe. After struggling to find success publishing fantasy and science fiction books for adults, his agent encouraged him to try writing for a younger audience, to meet the brief of a children's publisher. To fulfil the requirements of the brief, Delaney created a book based on a story he had first written in 1993, which was inspired by Stalmine's boggart, as well as Lancashire folklore and other stories. In 2004, he published the book as The Spook's Apprentice, under his real name, which became the first book in the dark fantasy Spook's series. Delaney achieved international success chronicling the adventures of his lead character, Tom Ward. The series has been published in 30 countries, with sales exceeding 4.5 million copies. Following the publication of the second book in the series, Delaney retired from teaching to write full-time. He identified J. R. R. Tolkien and Frank Herbert as his two biggest inspirations, Delaney, similar to Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, used his dreams to help write his stories.

From 2015 to 2017, Delaney published the science fiction Arena 13 trilogy. He published the dark fantasy Aberrations series from 2018 to 2019.

Delaney, who was living in Manchester, died on 16 August 2022, after a period of illness; he was 77 years old.

Personal life 
Delaney married Marie Smith in 1968; they had three children and nine grandchildren. She died of cancer in 2007. In 2014, he married Rani Kuncher Vannithamby.  

Delaney shared his name (including middle name) with the late Joseph H. Delaney, an American science fiction author of several books and short stories.

Works

Spook's 

Spook's (published in America as The Last Apprentice) follows Tom Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son, on his adventures as apprentice to John Gregory, the local "Spook" or master fighter of supernatural evil. John is the Spook for "the County" and gives Tom practical instruction on tackling ghosts, ghasts, witches, boggarts, and all manner of other things that serve "The Dark". Tom soon discovers that most of his predecessors have failed for various reasons—including death. As the Chronicles progress the focus expands to other characters such as the assassin Grimalkin and the young witch Alice Deane.

The Wardstone Chronicles 
Overall the first series' arc, titled The Wardstone Chronicles, develops the plot line of Tom being destined to either save the world or destroy it. "The County" referred to in the Chronicles is based on Lancashire in the north west of England. Several of the locations mentioned in the books are thinly-veiled versions of actual places; Priestown is the author's hometown of Preston, Caster is Lancaster, Black Pool is Blackpool, and Chipenden is Chipping.
