"Unintended" is a song by English rock band Muse, released as the fifth and final single from their 1999 debut album, Showbiz. It peaked at number 20 on the UK Singles Chart in June 2000 and reached number five in Norway in 2008.

Content
The lyrics tell the story of a person coming out of depression because they have recently found happiness from love, and they now wish to see their life through to the end.

Music video
The music video features many lovers 'blending' around each other as Matthew Bellamy and the band sit around. The blending effect is achieved using the slit-scan technique.

The song was released on 5 June 2000 on 7" vinyl – backed with a live version of "Sober" – double CD – backed with "Recess", a live acoustic version of "Falling Down", "Nishe" and a live acoustic version of "Hate This & I'll Love You" – and cassette – backed with "Recess". It reached number 20 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the highest-charting single from the album, and became a top-five hit in Norway in 2008, peaking at number five on the VG-lista chart.
