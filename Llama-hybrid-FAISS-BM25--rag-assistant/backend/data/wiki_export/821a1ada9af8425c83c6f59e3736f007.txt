2021 assault
A woman was knocked onto a rail track at the station around 9pm on 1 April 2021. CCTV of the incident circulated on social media. It showed teens standing on the platform. When one woman ran by, two teens attempted to shove her, one of them moving his bike into her path. A second woman with a bag ran by, the bike was shoved in her direction and she fell under the DART. Onlookers tried to help her and a security guard helped her as onlookers urged the driver not to move off in case she was injured. Youths were seen on CCTV moving away from the incident. Gardaí are treating it as an assault.

On 13 May 2021 Gardaí announced they had arrested three teenagers, two aged 16 and one aged 13. Gardaí announced that they had started a search of five locations pursuant to section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997.
