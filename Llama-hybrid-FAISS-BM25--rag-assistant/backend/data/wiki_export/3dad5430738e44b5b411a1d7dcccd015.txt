The Jharkhand cricket team is a first-class cricket team based in the Indian state of Jharkhand. When the old state of Bihar was split into Jharkhand state and Bihar state, the Jharkhand team took the place of the Bihar cricket team,  as much of the former's state's cricketing infrastructure was in Jharkhand.

History 
Jharkhand State Cricket Association was formed on November 15, 2000 and the team made its first-class debut in November 2004 against Saurashtra in the 2004/05 Ranji Trophy at Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground, Rajkot. The match was drawn.

The team won the 2010/11 Vijay Harare Trophy against Gujarat at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore. Jharkhand batted first and were boosted by several useful contributions from their batsmen while Gujarat in their reply failed to measure up against a dominating bowling performance to sink to a 159-run defeat.

In 2021, Jharkhand have scored 422 runs losing 9 wickets in the first innings. It is the highest ever total in 50 over domestic cricket in India. In March 2022, in the preliminary quarter-final match against Nagaland in the 2021â€“22 Ranji Trophy, Jharkhand made their highest team total in a first-class cricket match with 880, the fourth-highest team total in the Ranji Trophy.
