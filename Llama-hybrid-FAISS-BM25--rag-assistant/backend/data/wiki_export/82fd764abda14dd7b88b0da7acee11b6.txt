The Outlets were an American rock band, formed in Boston, consisting of David Alex Barton on vocals, his brother Rick Barton on lead guitar, Mike White on bass and Walter Gustafson on drums.

History
An acclaimed live band, The Outlets attained success in the greater Boston music scene but failed to gain national attention when they signed with Restless/Enigma in 1985, despite modest critical acclaim including a recommendation from Billboard. They are best known for the single "Knock Me Down", a regional hit. David Alex Barton reunited The Outlets in the late 1990s. The band reunited again in 2005. Barton's son, Charlie Alex-Barton, plays in the bands Call of Decency and Altitude Zero, bands which originated at the Fenn School. Alex-Barton also records under the stage name No Complaints.

Barton's brother, Rick went on to be a founding member of Dropkick Murphys, though he has subsequently left the group.  Following a stint with Everybody Out, Rick has been playing with Continental.  Walter Gustafson's post-Outlets resume includes several tours drumming for Gang Green as well as stints with The Freeze, Smegma and The Nunz, Mallet Head, DAMM and Nervous Eaters. Today he plays with Mung and Con-Sole.

Barton boys' cousin, the Somerville, Massachusetts guitarist/songwriter, Bill Trudell, co-wrote many Outlets songs, and helped define The Outlets' early sound. Trudell released a collection of songs entitled Pleasure Package in June 2008.

Much of The Outlets back catalog now resides at Fervor Records.
