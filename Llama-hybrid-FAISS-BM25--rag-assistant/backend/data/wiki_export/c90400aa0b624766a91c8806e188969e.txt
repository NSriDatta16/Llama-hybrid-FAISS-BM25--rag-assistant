The New York City Police Department's Medal for Valor is the department's third highest medal. It is conferred upon police officers for acts of outstanding personal bravery intelligently performed in the line of duty at imminent personal hazard to life under circumstances evincing a disregard for personal consequences. 

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) Medal for Valor is one of the highest honors awarded to members of the NYPD. It recognizes acts of extraordinary courage and bravery displayed by NYPD officers while in the line of duty, often involving personal risk or danger. The Medal for Valor is one of several awards given by the NYPD to honor its officers for their exceptional service and dedication to the community.

In order to receive the Medal for Valor, officers need to have their names nominated by other officers or citizens to a panel which reviews their nomination before forwarding it to Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ,who then takes the final decision. 

The Medal for Valor is typically presented during the NYPD Medal Day ceremony, an annual event held to honor the exceptional service and achievements of NYPD officers ,where various awards and medals are presented to officers, recognizing their outstanding performance, dedication, and commitment to serving the people of New York City.

Recipients of the Medal for Valor are well respected within their department and the community for their  bravery and commitment to public service.
