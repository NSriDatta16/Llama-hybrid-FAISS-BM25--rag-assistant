North on South St. is a hip-hop influenced album by Herb Alpert released in 1991 and his last vinyl release on A&M Records before he released Midnight Sun (available on CD and cassette only) in 1992. The album was a commercial success and produced two singles: "Jump Street" and "North on South St." Both of the singles had a video, yet "North on South St." got a bit of popularity because the video was featured on Beavis and Butt-head several years later.  There was a promotional plastic compass that was created as a marketing advertisement piece to commemorate the album release.
