"Don't Call Me Baby" is a song by Australian house music duo Madison Avenue, released as the first single from their only studio album, The Polyester Embassy (2000). Written by Cheyne Coates, Andy Van Dorsselaer, Duane Morrison, and Giuseppe Chierchia, the song includes a bassline sample from "Ma Quale Idea" by Italo disco artist Pino D'Angiò, which in turn is based on "Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now" by McFadden & Whitehead.

"Don't Call Me Baby" was released in Australia on 18 October 1999 and spent six non-consecutive weeks at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart, achieving triple-platinum status. It was also successful internationally, reaching number one in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in 2000. The song has been remixed both in 2014 and 2019 for its 15th and 20th anniversaries, respectively, including remixes by Tommie Sunshine, Mousse T., and Madison Avenue's writer-producer, Andy Van Dorsselaer.
