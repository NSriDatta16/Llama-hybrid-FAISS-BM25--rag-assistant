History

Bronze Age gold 
Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes the Atlantic Bronze Age Tydavnet gold discs. Dating from circa 2100 BC, these discs were discovered in the roots of an old tree. Raised lines, rows of dots and zig-zags produce a central cross surrounded by concentric patterns, were used to decorate the discs. The techniques of repoussé, punching and polishing, and doming of the surfaces are not seen on other similar discs. The pair of discs are on permanent display in the National Museum of Ireland.

Foundation and name 
The Irish name of the townland and village, , derives from the area's association with the 6th-century Irish saint, Saint Damnat. Damnat is thought to have founded a church in the area, which is generally considered to have been located in the graveyard of the current village Catholic church. This church, St. Dympna's Church, was originally erected in 1730, then rebuilt in the early 1900s and the interior renovated in the 1990s. It is one of the three existing Catholic churches in the parish. The other two churches are located in Corlat, and in Urbleshanny, near Scotstown.
