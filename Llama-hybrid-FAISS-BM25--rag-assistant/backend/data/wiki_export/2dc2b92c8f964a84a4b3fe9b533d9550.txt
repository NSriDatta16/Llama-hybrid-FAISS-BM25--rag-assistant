Sukjong of Goryeo (2 September 1054 – 10 November 1105) (r. 1095–1105) was the 15th ruler of the Goryeo dynasty of Korea.

Sukjong rose to the throne in 1095 upon the abdication of his young nephew, Heonjong.  He oversaw various internal innovations, including the distribution of the country's first brass coins (in 1102) and the construction of the new Southern Capital (Namgyeong, present-day Seoul).

However, he was also faced by threats from without, most notably an 1104 invasion by the northern Jurchen tribes. Unable to repel the Jurchens by force, he sent his general Yun Gwan to raise an army and repulse them. This army is known as Byeolmuban and consisted of three separate divisions. Sukjong died the following year, while on the way to the western capital, Pyongyang. Challenges of Sukjong's reign can be summarized in his own words:
