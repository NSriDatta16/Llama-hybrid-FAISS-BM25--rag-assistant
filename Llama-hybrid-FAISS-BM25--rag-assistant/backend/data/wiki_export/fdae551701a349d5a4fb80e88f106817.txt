Biography
He was born on March 22, 1910, in Dorchester, Boston where his father, Thorvald Martin Tandberg I (1874–1970), managed a restaurant. Thorvald was born in Portland, Maine. Carl's mother was Alvilde Marie Naess (1875–1933) of Oslo, Norway. His maternal uncle was Alfred Næss, the Norwegian speedskater.

His music career began in Boston in 1926 where he played in local ballrooms, restaurants and in radio stations WNAC and WEEI. Carl married Alice Nazian Gonyer (1909–1992) of Orono, Maine in 1929. They moved to Queens, New York where he played with the Jimmy Durante band, played vaudeville and toured the southern circuit with Al Wohlman & Company. He played 52nd street "jazz joints" and worked with Mike Riley and Ed Farley, the writers of The Music Goes Round and Round. He worked with Shep Fields (1910–1981) and His Rippling Rhythm Orchestra; and The Jerry Blaine (1910–1973) Orchestra in 1937. He played some college concerts with Bunny Berigan, and in 1939 he did a vaudeville tour and recorded with The Andrews Sisters. In 1947 he recorded Miserlou with Jan August. Around 1948 he moved to California and worked with the Frankie Ortega Trio in Las Vegas and at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach for 11 years. He moved to Burbank, California and, starting in 1957–1958, worked as a musician in Alhambra, California at Dick White's Rickey's Lounge with the Paul Peters Trio.
