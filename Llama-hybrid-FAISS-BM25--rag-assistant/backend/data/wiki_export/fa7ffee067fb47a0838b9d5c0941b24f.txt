Richard Bristow (1538 at Worcester â€“ 1581 at Harrow on the Hill in London, UK) was an English Catholic controversialist and Biblical scholar.

Life 
Richard Bristow was born in 1538 in Worcester, England.

At the Age of 17, he studied at the University of Oxford, possibly at Exeter College. In 1559, he gained his bachelor's degree. He continued his studies at Christ Church, Oxford, and gained his MA in 1562. 

In 1566, he and Edmund Campion were chosen to hold a public disputation before Queen Elizabeth I of England. After studying theology, Sir William Petre recommended him for a Fellowship at Exeter College; he became a Fellow in 1567. 

At this time the Reformation had taken hold in England and the Protestant Queen Elizabeth I had reigned for almost ten years.  England had previously been a Catholic country, but many people were changing their religious ideas; Bristow was one of these people. While he stayed loyal to his Catholic faith, he saw the need for changes in the religion. 

Two years after his appointment to the fellowship, he left Oxford for Leuven, where he met William Allen. Allen appointed him as the first Prefect of Studies at the new English College, Douai. He was Allen's "right hand upon all occasions", acting as rector when he was absent. The college moved to Reims in 1578.

Bristow is well known as an earnest student, a powerful controversial writer and, with Allen,  William Reynolds and Thomas Worthington, as one of the revisers of the Douay-Rheims Bible for Catholic readers.

His health began to fail and he was obliged to relinquish his work in 1581. In May of that year, he went to Spa, Belgium but his health did not improve and he was advised to return to England. He arrived in London in September with Jerome Bellamy, and stayed until his death.

Richard Bristow died at the early age of 43 on 18 October 1581. The Douay-Rheims edition of the New Testament was published the year after his death. The full Douay-Rheims Bible was published in 1610.
