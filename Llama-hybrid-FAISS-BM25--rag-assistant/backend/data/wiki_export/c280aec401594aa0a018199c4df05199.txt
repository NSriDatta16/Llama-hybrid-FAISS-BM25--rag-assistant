Bullwinkle's Restaurant, also known as Family Fun Center and formerly Bullwinkle's Family Food n' Fun is a chain of family entertainment centers. Locations feature a sit-down restaurant, complemented by arcade games, go-karts, bumper boats, mini golf, laser tag, a ropes course, a zip line, and small rides for children. Games and activities are generally themed around the company's namesake, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.

Description

Arcade
Bullwinkle's features a card swipe and/or token-operated amusement arcade section featuring over 100 popular video games and redemption games, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, The Simpsons  Game, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. More traditional arcade games, such as skeeball and basketball, are also available. Tickets can be redeemed for various prizes.

Restaurant

The restaurant section of Bullwinkle's has a log cabin feel, inspired by the Dudley Do-Right cartoon. The restaurant's main fare usually includes pizza and burgers, as well as wraps and salads. The animatronic show featured the likes of Bullwinkle, Rocky, Boris Badenov, Natasha Fatale, Dudley Do-Right, Underdog, Tooter Turtle, Hoppity Hooper, and at one location Tennessee Tuxedo and Chumley, but nowadays only Bullwinkle, Rocky, and Boris and Natasha are featured. The music and dialog for the animated musicals were recorded by Bill Broughton, featuring reprisals from Bill Scott,  June Foray, and others being impersonation voices.

Medford, New York had a Family Food 'n Fun location that opened in May 1999 featuring go-karts, bumper boats, a train ride around the park, and more. The location was purchased by Palace Entertainment in 2001 following an incident where a mini swing ride tipped over, injuring 9 people. It was renamed Boomers! Long Island shortly after. This location operated until September 29, 2019. The park has not been updated since and is now sitting abandoned, with most rides removed and relocated, although their Facebook page is still up.
