In Taiwan, law can be studied in an undergraduate program resulting in a Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) or a postgraduate degree resulting in a Masters of Law (LL.M.). Some LL.M. programs in Taiwan are offered to students with or without a legal background. However, the graduation requirements for students with a legal background are lower than for those students who do not have a legal background (to account for fundamental legal subjects that were taken during undergraduate studies). Students studying in an LL.M. program normally take three years to earn the necessary credits and finish a master’s thesis. Ph.D. degrees are also offered in the area of law.

Students in law school receive academic rather than practical training.  Practical training is arranged only after the individual passes the lawyer, judge or prosecutor exams.
