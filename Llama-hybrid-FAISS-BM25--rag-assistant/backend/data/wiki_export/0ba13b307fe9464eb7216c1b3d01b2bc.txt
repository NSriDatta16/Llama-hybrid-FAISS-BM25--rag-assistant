Joseph Howarth Ingles (born 2 October 1987) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He also represents the Australian national team. He primarily plays at the small forward position. He is the Utah Jazz all-time leader in three-pointers made.

Ingles was part of the Australian basketball team that won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Early life
Born in the Adelaide suburb of Happy Valley, Ingles played junior basketball for the Southern Tigers and attended Springbank Secondary College (then called Pasadena High School). Ingles attended both Lake Ginninderra College and the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) in Canberra with future Boomers teammates Brad Newley and Patty Mills. He played basketball for the AIS in the South East Australian Basketball League from 2005 to 2006. Along with basketball, Ingles also played Australian rules football and cricket in his younger years but gave up both sports to focus on basketball.

Ingles' two basketball goals as a boy were to play for the Adelaide 36ers and Australia. He was highly sought after when he came out of the AIS in 2006, and he subsequently met with the 36ers as a 17-year-old, but a couple of Adelaide blunders set him off interstate. Ingles said of the situation, "The minimum salary at the time was $20–$22,000 and while money wasn't a primary concern for me, they offered me a two-year deal at $12,500 per, plus two season tickets." Ingles had several other contract bids to consider, all offering at least the minimum and many of them providing additional incentives. His decision to not sign with the 36ers came when his contract from the club arrived with his first name misspelt as "Joesph". It did not leave a glowing impression on Ingles or his family, so he moved his attention to Melbourne.

Professional career

South Dragons (2006–2009)
On 17 March 2006, Ingles signed a multi-year deal with the South Dragons of the National Basketball League, becoming the very first player to sign with the club. In the Dragons' debut game, the 18-year-old Ingles made league history by scoring the most points by an Australian on debut – 29, on 11-of-15 shooting from the field. His excellent first season earned him the NBL Rookie of the Year Award. In 34 games in 2006–07, he averaged 15.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game.

In 2007–08, Ingles played in 30 games for the Dragons, averaging 15.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game.

He went on to help the Dragons win their maiden NBL championship with a 3–2 grand final series victory over the Melbourne Tigers. However, two months after winning their first title, the club folded due to financial difficulties. In 38 games for the club in 2008–09, Ingles averaged 13.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game.
