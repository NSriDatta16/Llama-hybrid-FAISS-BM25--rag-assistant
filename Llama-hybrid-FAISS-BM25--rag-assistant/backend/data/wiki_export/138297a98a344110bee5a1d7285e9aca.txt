Music career

Strings (1988–2021)
For Bilal and his band Strings, formed in 1988, success came in 1992 after the launch of the song Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar, which was well received by the public. The quartet disbanded in 1992 so the members could concentrate on their studies and came back years later in 1999, with Bilal Maqsood and Faisal Kapadia now forming a duo even if other artists would complement them during the live performances. Generally, the band's music was composed by Bilal while the lyrics were penned by his father Anwar Maqsood.

Strings made its entry into the Bollywood music scene in 2006, when the band sung Yeh Hai Meri Kahani for the movie Zinda, the single topping the charts.

The band ended in 2021.

Solo career (2022–present)
After his departure from Strings following 33 years of activities, Bilal launched his solo music career with gigs in Karachi and Lahore.

In May 2022, he released his first solo single, Naya Naya, which he co-wrote with his father.

Later during the same year he released the album Urdu Nursery Rhymes, having written, sung and composed eight nursery rhymes so children could get closer to the Urdu language. He developed an online series for children named Pakkay Dost () in the vein of Sesame Street to further bolster children's entertainment in Urdu; the first episode was released in September 2023.

Painting
Before seriously pursuing a career in music he was a painter, having his paintings exhibited at the Pakistan American Cultural Center in Karachi while he was still a student at the Indus Valley School of Art & Architecture.

Since the end of Strings he's spending time on painting again, involving his son Mikael Maqsood in the process as well.
