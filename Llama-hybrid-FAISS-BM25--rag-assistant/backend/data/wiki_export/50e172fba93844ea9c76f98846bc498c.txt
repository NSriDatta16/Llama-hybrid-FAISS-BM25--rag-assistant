Fox Sports News is an Australian cable and satellite sports news channel, owned by Fox Sports Pty Limited (formerly Premier Media Group) and is the sister channel of Fox Sports.

Fox Sports News launched on 1 October 2006. Initially, for 6 hours a day (midnight6am AEST) the channel would simulcast Sky Sports News, similar to the set-up of Australian News channel Sky News Australia. It was later replaced by a continuous loop of different newscasts broadcast that day.

On 5 March 2013 at Fox Sports new headquarters launch in Artarmon, New South Wales, among the announcements relating to Fox Sports was the new logo of Fox Sports and Fox Sports News which is in line with its global affiliate broadcasters.

On 3 November 2014, Fox Sports News launched a HD simulcast. In addition, it moved from channel 513 to channel 500.

Fox Sports News is available at the Fox Sports website free of charge. However, its live stream is only accessible in Australia.

The live programming has always been varied since the channel's launch. It was originally live from 6am to midnight, then 6am to 1am, and 5am to 1am. It currently runs live programming from 5:30 am to 12:30 am.
