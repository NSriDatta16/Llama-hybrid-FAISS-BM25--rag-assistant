Oakland City is a rail station in Atlanta, Georgia, serving the Red and Gold lines of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) rail system. Opened on December 15, 1984, it has one island platform between two tracks. Both sides of the station are accessed via a pedestrian underpass beneath adjacent roadways and, in the case of the east underpass, a freight railway. Though at-grade, the steep embankment on which this station is situated gives it the appearance of an elevated station. This station mainly serves the Oakland City, Sylvan Hills and Capitol View neighborhoods of Atlanta.

Bus service is provided at this station to Barge Road Park & Ride, South Fulton Medical Center, Sylvan Hills, and Greenbriar Mall.
