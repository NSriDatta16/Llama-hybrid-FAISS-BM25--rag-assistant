Heonan of Silla (died 861) (r. 857–861) was the 47th king of the Silla kingdom of Korea.  He was the younger half-brother of King Sinmu.   What little we know of his reign comes from the Samguk Sagi.

Following a famine in the year 859, he sent relief to the peasants and supported agriculture through the construction of irrigation works.

Being without a son, Heonan chose his relative Kim Eung-ryeom as his heir.  After his death, Kim Eung-ryeom took the throne, becoming King Gyeongmun.  His tomb in Gyeongju was known as the Gongjakji (공작지/孔雀趾).
