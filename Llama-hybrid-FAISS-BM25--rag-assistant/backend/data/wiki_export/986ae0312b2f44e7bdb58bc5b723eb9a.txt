Tantalus Provincial Park is a provincial park located in the Tantalus Range overlooking Squamish Valley in British Columbia, Canada. It was established on December 19, 1998 to protect a large area of pristine alpine wilderness.

History

In 1988, the Lake Lovely Water Recreation Area was established for the purpose of protecting the alpine lake area and for providing mountaineering opportunities in the Tantalus Range. The recreation area was greatly expanded and upgraded to a Class A Park on December 19, 1998.
