History
The natural bridge formation dates back about 200 million years. It was formed by water erosion of the weaker sandstone away from the stronger stone bridge spans, creating an erosion feature:  natural-bridge.

The park itself opened in 1954 to the public. It has long been known that the Creek Indians lived in this area, and they probably used the bridge-cave enclosure for shelter. Downhill from the bridge is the image of an Indian stone head; the origin of this formation is unknown.

This location was formerly known as "Lodi."
