Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus (born 19 June 1965 in São Paulo, Brazil) is a former Brazilian footballer, initially known on the football pitch as Ronaldo and then as Ronaldão (big Ronaldo) to differentiate him from his younger compatriot and teammate, also dubbed Ronaldo, who was nicknamed Ronaldinho (little Ronaldo) before this was adopted by Ronaldinho Gaúcho.

A former defender, Ronaldão played 14 matches in the Seleção (Brazil national football team) between 1991–1995, scored two goals and won the 1994 FIFA World Cup, although he did not start any matches. He was called up to the World Cup on its opening day, traveling from Japan to the United States as a substitute for injured Ricardo Gomes.

He was also successful at club level, winning numerous trophies.
