The Paraguayan Metropolitan Basketball League is the most important basketball league from Paraguay. As of 2015, 12 teams are participating in the league. The yearly winners of this league are considered the Paraguayan basketball champions, although only teams from Asunción compete (teams from other departments compete in the National League). Because of this, the champion gets the right to play in the South American Club Championship.
