(15 December 1903  – 15 March 1942) was one of the most prominent photographers in the first half of the 20th century in Japan.

Life
Yasui was born in Osaka and became a member of the Naniwa Photography Club  (, Naniwa Shashin Kurabu) in 1920s and also became a member of the Tampei Photography Club (, Tanpei Shashin Kurabu) in 1930.

His photographs cover a wide range from pictorialism to straight photography, including photomontages.  He appreciated every type and kind of photographs without any prejudice and tried not to reject any of them even during wartime.

Works 
 photographs of Jewish people who fled from the Nazis to Kobe (Japan) in the 1930s — in collaboration with several other photographers in the Tampei Shashin Club, such as Osamu Shiihara, Kaneyoshi Tabuchi and Tōru Kōno
