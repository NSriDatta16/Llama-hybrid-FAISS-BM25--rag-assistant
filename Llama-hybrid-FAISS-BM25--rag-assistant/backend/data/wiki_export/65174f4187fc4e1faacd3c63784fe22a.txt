Points of interest 
At Gartow, there is a facility for FM- and TV-transmission, with two over 300 metre tall guyed masts, the Gartow-Höhbeck transmitter. On August 20, 2009, the smaller mast has been demolished with explosives. Until the German reunification this transmitter was also used for the directional radio link to former West-Berlin (counter station: Richtfunkstelle Berlin-Frohnau).

Nearby Gorleben is a proposed deposit for nuclear waste. This led to much controversy and protests in the area.
