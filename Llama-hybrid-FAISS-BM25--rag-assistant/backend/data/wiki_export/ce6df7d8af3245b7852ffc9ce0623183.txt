The Mississauga Chargers are a Junior "A" ice hockey team from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.  They are a part of the Ontario Junior A Hockey League.  They are the product of a 1990 merger of two former Metro Junior B franchises, the Thornhill Thunderbirds and the Markham Connection.  After the 1990 merger the team spent one year in Markham known as the Markham Thunderbirds, and in 1991 they returned to their Thornhill Thunderbirds name for one season.  In 1992, the team moved to Mississauga.  As a member of the Metro Junior A Hockey League they participated for 3 seasons.  They left for the OPJHL in 1995. They have had a glim past few years, but in the 2007–08 season they saw a rare light when team captain Bruce Crawford lead the entire OPJHL in scoring (41-57-98).
