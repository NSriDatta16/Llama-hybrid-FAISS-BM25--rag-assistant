Constant "Stan" Van den Buijs (born 8 June 1957) is a Belgian retired football player.

Own goals
Some sources mention that he was the first player to score three own goals which were not deliberat in the same match, in a 2–3 loss for his team, Germinal Ekeren, against Anderlecht on 22 January 1995 in the Belgian first division, but this was not confirmed because the third goal was considered to have been scored by Johan Walem, who touched the ball before it crossed the goal line after it was diverted into the goal by Van den Buys.

Personal life
His son Dario Van den Buijs plays professionally in the Netherlands.
