Michael Caines Restaurants Ltd was founded in 1999 and the Michael Caines Restaurant opened at the Bristol Marriott Royal in July 2003.

In 2016 the hotel closed as the result of a devastating fire.

Together they developed the ABode Hotels concept.  There are 5 hotels in ABode Hotels: Exeter, Canterbury, Glasgow, Manchester, and Chester.

In 2016, Caines opened Lympstone Manor, a luxury boutique hotel and restaurant near Exmouth, Devon, which he describes as "the realisation of a dream, my vision of country house hospitality for the 21st Century".  He established a vineyard in the estate to produce a house champagne-method sparkling wine. Since its first harvest in 2020, the Triassic Pinot Noir was produced and has scooped a gold medal at the 2023 International Wine Challenge (IWC) and a bronze at the International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC).  October 2023 will see the launch of the Champagne-method sparkling wine the Classic Cuvée.

Caines relaunched The Cove Restaurant, situated in Maenporth near Falmouth in Cornwall, which had been owned and operated by Arty Williams and Annette Rickard for 17 years.  The relaunch began on 10 March 2020 and was billed to offer a "relaxed and informal approach to dining that is designed to attract families, locals and holidaymakers alike".  However, after less than 2 weeks, on 23 March 2020, the Cove had to temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown announcement, although has re-opened since.
