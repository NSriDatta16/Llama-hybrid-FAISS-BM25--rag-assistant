Staubkind is a German rock band from Berlin, founded in 2004 by Sven Louis Manke (guitarist of Terminal Choice). Initially, Staubkind was a gothic rock act with a similar sound to other German bands like Zeraphine and Dreadful Shadows. Since the release of their third album Staubkind in 2012, their sound has become more Unheilig-oriented, incorporating pop rock, indie and modern Schlager music to their sound. All of their lyrics are written in German.

History 
Louis Manke, a singer and guitar player from Dresden, founded Staubkind in 2004. In the same year, the first single Keine Sonne and the debut album Traumfänger were published via the Berlin independent label Fear Section of singer and musician Chris Pohl. On 31 January 2004, Staubkind played their first official concert. On 3 April 2004, the band played the first big show supporting Unheilig at Sommercasino in Basel. The first big show on a festival took place at the 13th Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig.
In autumn 2004, Staubkind continued playing live on their first own headlining tour through Germany, reaching up to 2005.
On 31 January 2005, the debut album Traumfänger was re-released with some remixes and the bonus track Viel mehr. For the new song Viel mehr, Staubkind also shot their first video.
On 1 October 2005, an EP including three new songs and two live tracks was published with the title Ausgebrannt.
During the years of 2005 and 2006, Staubkind toured all over Germany and played shows at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig and M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, among others.

Louis Manke changed the record label and signed at Out of Line in Berlin in 2012. The singles Kannst du mich seh'n and So nah bei mir were published there in February and June 2012. There were videos for both pre-singles, too.
On 29 June, the band's self-titled third album was released. It was developed in collaboration with Unheilig's producer Henning Verlage at the Principal Studios in Senden.
