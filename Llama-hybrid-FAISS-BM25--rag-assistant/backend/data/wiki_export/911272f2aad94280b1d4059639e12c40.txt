"Ten Storey Love Song" is a song by English rock band the Stone Roses, released as the second single from their album, Second Coming (1994), on 27 February 1995. It was written by guitarist John Squire. The song reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and spent three weeks on the chart. The B-sides, "Moses" and "Ride On", were the last new songs released by the group until "All for One" was released in 2016.

Music video
A music video, directed by Sophie Muller, accompanied the single but the video was shot without the drummer, Reni, who did not turn up. Only three members of the band (Squire, Ian Brown and Mani) appear in the video although an unidentified man wearing a mask of Reni's face appears several times. Ian Brown did not turn up for the first day of the video shoot, this is reflected in the video when John Squire and Mani are watching footage of Ian Brown and Reni on a TV screen and look at their watches.
