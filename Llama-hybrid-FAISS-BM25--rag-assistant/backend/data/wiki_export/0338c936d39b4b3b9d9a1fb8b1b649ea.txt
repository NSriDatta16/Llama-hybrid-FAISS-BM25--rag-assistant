Symphony of Stones
One section of the Azat, where it meets River Goght, is particularly fascinating. It is a canyon known as Canyon of Garni. The canyon's formation is so unique that it almost looks artificial. The canyon is composed of regular hexagonal prisms. Near its end, the gorge's beautiful formation has prompted the name "Symphony of Stones".
