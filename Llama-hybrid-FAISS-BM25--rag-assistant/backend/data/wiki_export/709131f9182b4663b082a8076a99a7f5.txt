Ha'il Aziz Ahmad Al Maythal is a citizen of Yemen, who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba.
American intelligence analysts estimate that he was born in 1977, in Zemar, Yemen.

As of August 14, 2011, Hail Aziz Ahmad Al Maythal has been held at Guantanamo for eight years 10 month.

Maythal was transferred to Oman on January 16, 2017.

Official status reviews

Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the "war on terror" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.
In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants

Following the Supreme Court's ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.

Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain common allegations:

 Ha'il Aziz Ahmad Al Maythal  was listed as one of the captives who "The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad."

Habeas corpus petition

On July 18, 2008, Jennifer R. Cowan renewed his habeas petition.

Periodic Review

Al Maythal's Guantanamo Review Task Force had concurred with earlier review boards, and recommended he be classed as too dangerous to release, although there was no evidence to justify charging him with a crime.
