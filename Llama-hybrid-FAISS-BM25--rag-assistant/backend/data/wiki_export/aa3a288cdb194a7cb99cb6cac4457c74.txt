Name
Air Panas is named after the hot springs available near the town. The town is also known as Bukit. Most of the businesses and facilities are located at Pekan Air Panas. The settlement was opened on Thursday, 3 December 1806. The name Tenang comes from the settler who first opened the settlement, Tuan Haji Muhammad Arifin bin Aladin aka Syed Kamarul Ariffin bin Syed Allauddin of Pagaruyung when he found the new settlement area, which was so serene (hence the Malay word Tenang). After he performed his prayer, he decided to name this place with the name Kampung Tenang (next to Pekan Air Panas), also known as Tok Tenang. Most of Tok Tenang's descendants live in this area and Labis town.
