Julius Alfred Chatwin FRIBA, ARBS, FSAScot (24 April 1830 – 6 June 1907) was a British architect. He was involved with the building and modification of many churches in Birmingham, and practised both Neo-Gothic and Neo-Classical styles. His designs always included all of the carvings and internal fittings.

Career 
Born the son of John Chatwin (1796-1855), a button manufacturer in Great Charles Street, Birmingham, and Harriet (1793-1848; née Turner), and educated at King Edward's School on New Street and the University of London, he was known by the name Alfred. He worked from 1846 as an architect for the largest builders in the country, Branson and Gwyther of Birmingham. He was articled to Charles Barry in 1851 and worked with Barry and Augustus Pugin on the Victoria Tower of the Houses of Parliament. He worked again for Gwyther personally on his enterprises in Llandudno, North Wales. In 1855 he opened an office on Bennett's Hill in Birmingham. He was, from 1866, architect to the Governors of King Edward's School and designed the first King Edward VI High School for Girls on New Street. From 1864 he became architect to Lloyds Bank for over thirty years.

From 1866 he worked with his son, Philip Boughton Chatwin (P. B. Chatwin) (1873–1964) who became his partner in 1897.

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA) on 30 November 1863 and member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors (ARBS), Royal Society of Arts (RSA), and Fellow of the Royal Antiquary Society of Scotland.

He married at St James, Handsworth on 26 October 1869. He is buried with his wife Edith Isabella Chatwin and daughter Isabella Gertrude Chatwin in St Bartholomew's Church, Edgbaston. His gravestone also mentions his daughter Grace Constance Chatwin (cremated).

J.A. Chatwin was the great-grandfather of the writer Bruce Chatwin.
