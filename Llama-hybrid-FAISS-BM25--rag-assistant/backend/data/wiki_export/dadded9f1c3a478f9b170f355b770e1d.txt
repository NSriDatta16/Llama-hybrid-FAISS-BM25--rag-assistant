Abraham Orlando Núñez Adames [NOO-nyez] (born March 16, 1976) is a Dominican former professional baseball third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1997 to 2008 for the Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, and New York Mets. Núñez primarily played third base, but was capable of playing all four infield positions.

Career
He played 630 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates from -. He joined the St. Louis Cardinals in , and with a mid season injury to third baseman Scott Rolen, Núñez saw his playing time increase, becoming the everyday starter at third base for the rest of the season and the playoffs. After the 2005 season, he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent. While he was with the Phillies, Nunez was used in roles as a defensive replacement and as a starter when pitcher Jamie Moyer was on the mound. Nunez is known for his sharp fielding skills, and was apparently a better fielder than the Phillies Greg Dobbs and Wes Helms who, as a Philly sportswriter said, "fields with oven mitts".

At the start of 2008, he signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers, but was later released, and during May he signed on with the New York Mets.
