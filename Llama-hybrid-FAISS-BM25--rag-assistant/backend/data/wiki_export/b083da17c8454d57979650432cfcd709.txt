Collingham railway station is in the village of Collingham, Nottinghamshire, England, on the Nottingham to Lincoln Line. It is owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway, which provide all services.

History
It is on the Nottingham to Lincoln Line, which was engineered by George Stephenson and opened by the Midland Railway on 3 August 1846. The contractors for the line were Craven and Son of Newark and Nottingham; The Grade II listed station building in aggressive Italianate style is dated ca. 1848 and is thought to be by the architect I.A. Davies.

On 2 January 1854 a mail train from Nottingham to Lincoln experienced a failure of two wheels under the brake van. The Newark Road crossing keeper saw the guard's red light signal and switched on his danger signal bringing the train to a halt before any serious damage was done. Five days later on 7 January, a train leaving Collingham for Lincoln experienced some fragmentation of some of the engine wheels. Fortunately no injuries were sustained.

On 5 August 1857 an excursion train was proceeding from Carlton to Grimsby. Shortly after passing Collingham a number of the carriages derailed. Some passengers jumped from the carriages, and a young woman 18 years of age, Miss Brewster of Stoke Bardolph, was killed.

On 18 March 1861 George Taylor, an employee of George Johnson coal merchant, was loading a cart with coal. Perceiving that the ass and cart were in danger of being run over by a truck which was being shunted from the main line into the siding, he leaped from the truck and applied the brake. He was then hit by the buffer of a loaded truck and knocked down. The wheel went over his right leg and at the hospital in Newark later that evening, it was amputated.

Stationmasters
On 6 May 1848, Meynell Huntley, station master, was charged at Nottingham Assizes with embezzling money belonging to the Midland Railway. At the trial in July held before Lord Chief Justice Denman he pleaded guilty to the theft of three cheques with a total value of Â£30 6s (). Despite having a wife and family he was sentenced to 12 years transportation. He was imprisoned in the Hulks at Woolwich until he was transported on the Hashemy which departed England on 19 July 1850 and arrived in Western Australia on 25 October 1850.
