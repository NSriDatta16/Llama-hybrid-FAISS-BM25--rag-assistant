The 1989–90 UEFA Cup was won by Juventus on aggregate over Fiorentina. This was the first final between two Italian sides in the UEFA competitions history and the third between two clubs of the same country.

It was the last season for which English clubs were banned from European competitions, as sequel to the Heysel disaster in May 1985. The English clubs who missed out of this season of the competition were Nottingham Forest and Norwich City.
