During Florida's Territorial Period (1821–1845). Green Hill Chaires along with brothers Benjamin of Vendura Plantation and Thomas Peter of Woodlawn Plantation
moved to Leon County establishing very large plantations. Green Hill Chaires' first plantation started large and eventually grew to 20,000 acres (80 km2) and had a large home on Lake Lafayette.

Also on the transportation end, Chaires was on the 1861–1865 Board of Directors of the Tallahassee Railroad.
