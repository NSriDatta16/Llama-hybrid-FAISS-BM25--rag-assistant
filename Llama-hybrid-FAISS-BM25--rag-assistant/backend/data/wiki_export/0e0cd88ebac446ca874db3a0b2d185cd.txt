"Count on Me" is a song recorded by American singers and best friends Whitney Houston and CeCe Winans. Co-written and produced by Babyface, it is an uplifting song about leaning on a friend for support when needed. Released in early 1996, the song was the fourth single from the soundtrack album of the motion picture Waiting to Exhale, and the second single by Houston released from that album and its soundtrack. "Count on Me" became Winans's highest-charting single on the US Hot 100, peaking at number eight. It was certified gold in the US.

Critical reception
AllMusic editor Craig Lytle wrote, "She (Whitney) teams with Cece Winans on the inspirational duet "Count on Me", and both accomplished singers raise all hopes with their comforting vocals." A reviewer from Billboard deemed the song "torchy". The magazine's Larry Flick commented, "The touch of superstar producer Babyface is, as always, unmistakable, and he excels with this song's lush string arrangement. Vocally, Houston dominates the track, though Winans makes a strong-enough impression that those who have yet to hear her fine recordings will yearn to hear more. A buddy song for the diva generation that is destined to saturate pop radio airwaves into the spring." 

Gil L. Robertson IV from Cash Box picked it as a "standout track" of the soundtrack album. Chicago Tribune editor Greg Kot felt that Winans's is one of the few voices on the album that sounds enraptured. British magazine Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, "a slightly lethargic ballad from the Waiting To Exhale soundtrack but, since everything Houston touches turns to gold, put your money on this reaching the Top 10." Gary Darling from The Orlando Sentinel commented that "with its swelling choruses and shouted pledges of friendship", the song "is infused with We Are the World earnestness and overkill, but the performances save it from being too treacly".

Music video
The accompanying music video for the song features Houston and Winans giving a concert performance, while clips of the Waiting to Exhale feature film are sporadically mixed in. The "Count on Me" music video peaked at number one on music channels BET, MTV, and VH1.
