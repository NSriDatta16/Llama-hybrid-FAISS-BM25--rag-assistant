Amanita citrina (synonym Amanita mappa), commonly known as the false death cap or citron amanita, is a basidiomycotic mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It grows in silicate soil in the summer and autumn months. It bears a pale yellow or sometimes white cap, with white stem, ring and volva. Though not deadly, it is inedible and often confused for the lethal death cap (Amanita phalloides).

Description

This mushroom has a fleshy pale yellow, or sometimes white, cap from  across, covered in irregular patches. The gills and flesh are white. There is a large volva at the base of the  tall stem, which has a clear ring. It is often confused with the related death cap mushroom (Amanita phalloides), hence the name.

Distribution and habitat
The false death cap is found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in Autumn in Europe. It is also found in North American oak and pine forests.

Toxicity
It has been shown that this mushroom contains the alpha-amanitin toxin. However, the amounts of this toxin were found to be very small and would not cause any adverse effects unless the mushroom was ingested in very large amounts. It also contains the toxin bufotenin. Although it is considered inedible, the biggest danger with this species is its marked similarity to the death cap.

This mushroom is not eaten, having a smell of rapeseed or potato.
