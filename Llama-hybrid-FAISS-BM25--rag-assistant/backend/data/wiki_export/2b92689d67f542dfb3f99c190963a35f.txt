John Fleming  (or John "00" Fleming; born 1 April 1969) is an English trance producer and DJ from Worthing, West Sussex. He has had releases on record labels such as Ministry of Sound, Deconstruction Records, Logic Records, and 3 Beat Music.  He also owns and runs Joof Recordings.  He has performed at many clubs including Cream, Gatecrasher, Ministry of Sound, and Godskitchen.

In his early 20s, Fleming battled lung cancer.  Fleming was originally involved in goa music, but changed over to harder trance music before shifting to psychedelic trance.  He traces his influences back to early 1980s acts such as Jean Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, and current acts like Astral Projection, Airwave, Trifonic.

JOOF Radio (formerly Global Trance Grooves) is his monthly mix broadcast on Digitally Imported.

JOOF Recordings
After many releases, remixes and compilations, Fleming formed the trance label, JOOF Recordings in 1998. The label's first release was a collaboration between Fleming and Russell Floorplay titled "We Have No Reference of Time". Fleming set up subsidiary labels JOOF Deep and JOOF Test Series, however they were short-lived and have not seen any releases since 2006. JOOF has released singles, albums, and remixes from artists including Airwave, John O'Callaghan, Anne Savage, Solar Fields, Mike Dierickx, Wizzy Noise, Anton Chernikov, Oliver Prime, L.S.G. and Liquid Soul. The label has performed well with the trance and psychedelic trance market with many releases, such as LSG - Netherworld 2005 and Airwave - Parallel Lines, which received support from Armin Van Buuren, Tiësto, Above & Beyond and Paul Oakenfold.

In 2011, Fleming set up JOOF V.2, which has seen releases from J. Michael Cober, Elyseun, Red & Blue, Adam Antine, and Gary Delaney.

In 2015, John appointed Gary Delaney, and Daniel Lesden as the new A&Rs for JOOF Recordings, responsible for overseeing the growth of the label. At the start of 2016, John re-branded 'JOOF V2' to 'JOOF Mantra', a hub dedicated to the label's notorious psy-trance sound. 2016 also saw the formation of "JOOF Aura", a new label dedicated to deep-seated, and trance-orientated Progressive House tracks.
