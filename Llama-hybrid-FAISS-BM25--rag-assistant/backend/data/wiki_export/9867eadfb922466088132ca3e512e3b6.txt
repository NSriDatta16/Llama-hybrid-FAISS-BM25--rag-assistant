The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center is a private, non-profit 501(c)(3) agency.  The Sailing Center provides educational and recreational sailing programs to those who wish to gain access to Lake Michigan and learn to sail; regardless of age, ability, or financial concerns.  In 2004, MCSC celebrated its 25th year of sailing.

Much like a co-operative, the Sailing Center owns and maintains over 80 boats and provides members no-charge access to the fleet after they successfully demonstrate basic sailing skills and earn a rating.  Membership is low cost, less than the cost of insurance on a privately owned sailboat, and works on a sliding scale based on age, experience and income.  The Sailing Center also offers private boat owners 24-hour access to the lake, year-round boat and dinghy storage, mast stepping boat launching and haul out services.

Each summer the Sailing Center partners with local organizations to provide sailing opportunities to thousands of at-risk and economically disadvantaged youth, the physically challenged and others.  The Sailing Center also provides social activities and volunteer opportunities to members.

Mission

The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center is a private, non-profit agency that works to strengthen the sport of sailing through an active educational program and on-the-water sailing in a professional and safe manner.  The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center strives to be the organization of choice for people who wish to sail, for both the enjoyment and thrill of competition.

Location/Sailing Area

The Milwaukee Community Sailing Center () is located north of downtown in the heart of Veterans Park at McKinley Marina.  The sailing area crosses the McKinley Mooring Basin as Light and Medium Air sailors remain inside the breakwater.  Heavy air sailors may sail outside the breakwater; however, before leaving the docks, sailors must develop a sailing plan based on the wind direction, keeping the safest and shortest route in mind.

Fleet/Facilities

The fleet () at the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center makes up one of the largest of any community sailing program in the country.  The fleet of 80 boats includes  Pearson Ensign, J-24s, and Solings.  For younger sailors, the Sailing Center's fleet includes Hunter 146s, DC Dinghys and 470s, a two-person Olympic racer.  The Sailing Center uses a JY Club Trainer for use in area park lagoons.

History

Founded in 1977, the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center was created by a group of local sailors who sought to form a community organization to make sailing accessible to all in the Milwaukee area and dispel the myth that sailing is an elitist sport.  With seed money from Ted Seaver, Doug Drake and Milwaukee County offices and a maintenance facility were built.  Completed in 1980, and the Sailing Center opened with lessons and boat rentals.  With an enthusiastic staff of 10 and a humble fleet of Tech Dinghies, Volants and a safety boat, Milwaukee had a unique way to take advantage of the lake.

After the Sailing Center’s first year, twelve students graduated from the courses provided and the Sailing Center began to grow.  Today, hundreds of new members are learning to sail through Sailing Center programs. The nationally renowned "Prams in the Park" program began in 1985 and continues to bring sailing and water safety to Milwaukee County Park lagoons, offering scholarships to economically disadvantaged youth and giving individuals the opportunity to participate, learn and have fun.

The Sailing Center’s education and recreational programs have seen success as well.  The Sailing Center offers adult and youth members a full range of basic, intermediate and advanced sailing courses, as well as regattas, volunteer instructor opportunities and open sailing seven days a week on a variety if sailboats.

The Sailing Center now owns and maintains over 80 boats, one of the largest such fleets of any non-profit sailing organization in the U.S., including specifically designed Access Dinghies for physically challenged sailors.  With four full-time, year-round staff, which expands to 40 during the sailing season, and a strong base of 700+ members, the Sailing Center provides great times and wonderful outings for all who want to enjoy the sport of sailing in the City of Milwaukee.
