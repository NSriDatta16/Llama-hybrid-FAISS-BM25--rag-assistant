Prince of Wagram (; ) was a title of French nobility that was granted to Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier in 1809. It was created as a victory title by Emperor Napoleon I after the Battle of Wagram. Berthier had previously been granted the title of Sovereign Prince of Neuchâtel in 1806.

After the death of Berthier in 1815, the subsequent inheritors of the title lived at the Château de Grosbois, a large estate in Boissy-Saint-Léger, Val-de-Marne, southeast of Paris. Since the 4th Prince of Wagram had not yet married when he was killed in action during World War I, the title became extinct in 1918.
