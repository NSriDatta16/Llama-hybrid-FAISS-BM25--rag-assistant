Spind is a former municipality that was located in the old Vest-Agder county in Norway. The  municipality existed from 1893 until 1965. It was located on the Spind peninsula in the western part of the present-day municipality of Farsund in Agder county. The peninsula lies between the Lygndalsfjord and the Rosfjord. The administrative centre of Spind was located in the village of Rødland where Spind Church is located.

History
The municipality of Spind was established on 17 October 1893 when it was split from the municipality of Herad. At the time of its establishment, Spind had 1,410 inhabitants. On 1 July 1916, a small part of the neighboring municipality of Austad (population: 4) was transferred to Spind. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, Spind (population: 606) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Herad and Lista and with the town of Farsund to form a new, larger municipality of Farsund.

Name
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Spind farm () since it was an old name for the area. The name is identical with the Old Norse word  which means "lump" or "knoll", probably because the land has many rolling hills.

Government
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.
