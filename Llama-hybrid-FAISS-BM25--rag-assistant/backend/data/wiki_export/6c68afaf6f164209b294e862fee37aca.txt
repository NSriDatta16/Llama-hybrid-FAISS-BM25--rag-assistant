David Victor Mark Mallet (born 17 December 1945) is a British director of music videos and concert films. He was one of the most prolific directors of music videos in the 1980s.

Career 
Mallet rose to prominence in the late 1970s as a director of the then new format of music videos with the hugely successful enterprise MGMM, which he co-founded with Scott Millaney, Brian Grant and Russell Mulcahy. He is noted for his innovative work on hugely popular music videos in the 1980s, becoming one of the decade's most sought-after directors for this format. His work includes Iron Maiden's "Run to the Hills", David Bowie's "Ashes to Ashes" and "Let's Dance", Rush's "Distant Early Warning", and Queen's "Radio Ga Ga" and "I Want to Break Free" videos. He has directed numerous videos for AC/DC since the 1980s. He has also served as a producer on television programmes including The Kenny Everett Video Show. He is also known for directing some concert recordings of soprano Sarah Brightman and other major live music and spectacle events such as 46664 and Cirque du Soleil. He has also directed such prominent concerts as Pink Floyd's Pulse and U2's PopMart: Live from Mexico City.
