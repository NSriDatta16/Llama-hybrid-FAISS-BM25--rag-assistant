John Stanton Fleming Morrison DFC (17 April 1892 â€“ 28 January 1961) was a British golf course architect born in Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK. He worked predominantly with Charles Alison, Harry Colt, and Alister MacKenzie, in 1928 forming Colt, Alison & Morrison Ltd.

John Morrison was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where his studies in history and law extended from 1912 to 1919, interrupted by his war service. He was a bomber pilot during World War I and a Group Captain in the RAF during World War II. He was among the first pilots to land an airplane on an aircraft carrier. He was awarded the DFC and bar.

In his younger years he was a talented all-round sportsman, representing England at football as an amateur and playing first-class cricket with Cambridge University and Somerset. He won Blues for cricket, football and golf. He also won the Belgian Amateur Golf Championship in 1929. In 1914 he scored 233 not out for Cambridge against Marylebone Cricket Club, batting for only 165 minutes. At the time it was a record first-class score for Cambridge and a record for the Fenner's ground.

He became the managing director of Colt, Alison and Morrison in 1952 after his partners died, and remained in that position until his death in 1961. He married twice, and had one daughter.
