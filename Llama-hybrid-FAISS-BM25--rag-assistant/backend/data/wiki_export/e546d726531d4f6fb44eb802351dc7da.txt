He has won ten Emmy Awards and has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Broughton is currently a lecturer in composition at UCLA.

Career
Broughton has composed the score for many notable films including Disney films such as The Rescuers Down Under (1990), All I Want for Christmas (1991), Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) and its sequel, Lost in San Francisco (1996), as well as popular westerns such as  Silverado (1985) and Tombstone (1993). Other films scored by Broughton include Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), Baby's Day Out (1994), Harry and the Hendersons (1987), Miracle on 34th Street (1994), and The Boy Who Could Fly (1986). Additionally, he composed music for the video game Heart of Darkness and the animated TV series  Tiny Toon Adventures. In 1994, Broughton also conducted the fanfare for the 20th Century Studios logo that was composed by Alfred Newman. Furthermore, he also conducted the fanfare for Cinergi Pictures that was composed by Jerry Goldsmith.

Silverado earned him an Academy Award nomination, though he lost the Oscar to Out of Africa. He has won nearly a dozen Emmy awards.

Broughton is a member of the Board of Directors of ASCAP, a former Governor of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, a Past President of the Society of Composers & Lyricists, and a lecturer at UCLA and USC.

Academy Awards controversy

Broughton's song "Alone yet Not Alone", from the film with the same name, was originally nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song at the 86th Academy Awards.  But on January 29, 2014, the nomination was revoked after the Academy discovered that Broughton, a former Academy governor who, at the time, was an executive committee member of the Academy's music branch, had improperly contacted other branch members.

"No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one's position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one's own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage," Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the Academy's President, said in a statement.  Not everyone agreed with the Academy's actions.
