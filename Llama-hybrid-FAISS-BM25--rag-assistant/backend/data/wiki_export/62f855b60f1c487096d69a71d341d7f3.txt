North Queensland Cowboys
In Round 15 of the 1996 ARL season, Cowboys' head coach Graham Lowe named Hannay to make his first grade debut against the Western Suburbs Magpies. At 16 years and 185 days old, Hannay would have been the second youngest player to debut in Australian history after Ray Stehr, who debuted at 16 years and 85 days in 1929. The selection was ultimately blocked by the Australian Rugby League (ARL), as Hannay (who was born in 1980), had to turn 17 the year he debuted to be eligible.

In Round 3 of the 1998 NRL season, almost two years after his vetoed debut, the now 18-year old Hannay made his NRL debut in the Cowboys' 16–15 win over the Parramatta Eels, scoring a try.

Over the next two seasons, Hannay was further plagued by injuries, playing only 17 games, including just five in 2000. In 2002, he played his first full season in four years, starting in 19 games for the Cowboys and finishing as their top point scorer.

In 2003, Hannay enjoyed a breakout season, playing 23 games and scoring 230 points, second in the NRL only to Hazem El Masri's 294. On 16 July 2003, he made his State of Origin debut for Queensland, starting at  and kicking four goals in a 36–6 Game III win over New South Wales at Suncorp Stadium. In Round 23 of the 2003 season, Hannay set the record for most points (24) and most goals (10) in a single game for the Cowboys in their 60–8 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs. As of 2020, his 10-goal record still stands, while Johnathan Thurston later equalled his points record in 2006.

In June 2007, he was dropped from the Sharks' NSW Cup side and began playing for the Gymea Gorillas in the local Cronulla-Sutherland District competition before being granted a release by the club.

Celtic Crusaders
In August 2007, Hannay signed the Celtic Crusaders, who were playing in the National League Two, helping them to promotion to the National League One. In 2008, he was a member of the Crusaders' side who lost to Salford City in the National League One Grand Final. Despite losing the Grand Final, the Crusaders finished second and earned promotion to the Super League for the first time. In 2009, he played 17 Super League games for the Crusaders, finishing as the club's top point scorer.

Hannay did not get to finish the season, as he, along with Australian teammates Jace Van Dijk, Tony Duggan, Damien Quin, Darren Mapp and Mark Dalle Cort were deported after the UK Border Agency ruled they breached visa regulations. Hannay was banned from entering the United Kingdom for 10 years and his Crusaders' contract was cancelled with immediate effect.
