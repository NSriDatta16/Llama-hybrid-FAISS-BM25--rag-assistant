History
The counterpart of the Myanmar-language Myanmar Alin (), the New Light of Myanmar is claimed by its editors to be the oldest English-language daily, first published on 12 January 1964 as The Working People's Daily. The newspaper took on its current name on 17 April 1993.

According to Bertil Lintner of The Irrawaddy, another New Light of Myanmar had been founded in 1914, published initially as a magazine before becoming a newspaper. It was managed by U Tin from 1920 to 1947. The newspaper was shut down by the military junta in 1969.
