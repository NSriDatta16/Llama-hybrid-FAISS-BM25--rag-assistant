Ganti Mohana Chandra Balayogi Athletic Stadium, formerly known as the Gachibowli Athletic Stadium, is a multipurpose stadium situated in the Gachibowli suburb of Hyderabad, Telangana, India. It is located beside International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT Hyderabad). The sports complex was built in 2002 by the N. Chandrababu Naidu Government to host the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. It is used mostly for association football matches as is it currently the home of Indian Super League club Hyderabad FC.  The stadium holds 17,500 people and contains an eight-lane 400m running synthetic athletic track, a 10-lane 100m sprinting track and a four-lane synthetic warm-up track. Inside the athletic tracks lies a football field  in size. It was built at a cost of Rs.35.30 crores covering a built-up area of .

Structure

The highlight of the stadium's structure is the cantilevered roof covering the spectator stands. The simple yet innovative structural design allows a  span cantilever allowing the spectators an unobstructed view of the sporting events.  Diagonal yellow steel structural members act as tension members to balance out the forces of the cantilevered roof of the spectator stands. These members not only add to the exterior appearance, but also help in creation of a well-defined ambulatory path along the stadium.  Orange coloured corrugated metal sheets wrap around the inner and outer edges of the roof trusses. This inexpensive cladding enhances the appearance of the stadium greatly.

It is an ultra modern stadium with eight line competition synthetic athletic track and 4-lane synthetic practice track. It uses the latest high-mast lighting for day-night events and provides obstruction-free viewing for all spectators. The stadium was named in the memory of G. M. C. Balayogi, an incumbent Speaker of Lok Sabha who died in an air crash.

The 2003 Afro-Asian Games were held in this stadium. More than 30,000 people came to watch the opening ceremony. The opening ceremony was about two hours and forty minutes long with a laser show son-et-lumiere''.

About 2,800 Kuchipudi artistes performed a centuries-old dance on 26 December 2010 to earn a place in the Guinness World Records.
