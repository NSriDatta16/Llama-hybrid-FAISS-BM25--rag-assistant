Big Chico Creek is a creek in northeastern California that originates near Colby Mountain in Lassen National Park.  It flows  to its confluence with the Sacramento River in Butte County.  The creek's elevation declines from  above sea level at its head to  where it joins the Sacramento River, as shown on the Ord Ferry USGS quadrangle. Big Chico Creek forms part of the demarcation between the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range.

A portion of Big Chico Creek flows through the city of Chico's Bidwell Park and California State University, Chico.
