Gaya district is one of the thirty-eight districts of the Indian state of Bihar. It was officially established on 3 October 1865. The district has a common boundary with the state of Jharkhand to the south. Gaya city is both the district headquarters and the second-largest city in Bihar.

History
Gaya finds mention in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana, are stated to have visited Gaya for offering pinda-dana to their father Dasharatha. In the Mahabharata, the place has been identified as Gayapuri. In the Vayu Purana, it is stated that Gaya was the name of a demon (asura) whose body became pious after he performed rigid penance and secured blessings from Vishnu. It was said that the Gayasura's body would continue to be known as Gaya Kshetra.

Gaya has experienced the rise and fall of many dynasties in the Magadha Region. From the 6th century BC to the 18th century AD, about 2300–2400 years, Gaya has been occupying an important place in the cultural history of the region. It opened up with the Shaishunaga dynasty founded by Shishunaga, who exercised power over Patna and Gaya around 600 BC. Bimbisara, fifth in line, who lived and ruled around 519 BC, had projected Gaya to the outer world. The region was influenced by Gautama Buddha and Mahavira during the reign of Bimbisara. After a short spell of Nanda dynasty, Gaya and the entire Magadha region came under the Mauryan rule with Ashoka (272 BC – 232 BC) embracing Buddhism. He visited Gaya and built the first temple at Bodh Gaya to commemorate Prince Gautama's attainment of supreme enlightenment.

The period of Hindu revivalism commenced with the coming of the Guptas during the 4th and 5th century A.D. Samudragupta of Magadha helped to bring Gaya in limelight. It was the headquarters of the Behar district during the Gupta empire.

Gaya then passed on to the Pala Empire with Gopala as the ruler. It is believed that the present temple of Bodh Gaya was built during the reign of Dharmapala, son of Gopala.

Gaya was in the 12th century invaded by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji. The place finally passed on to the British after the battle of Buxar in 1764. Gaya district, along with other parts of the country, won freedom in 1947. Gaya is also the birthplace of eminent  nationalist and the first Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Dr. Anugrah Narain Sinha.

Gaya formed a part of the district of Behar and Ramgarh till 1864. It was given the status of independent district in 1865. Subsequently, in May 1981, Magadh Division was created by the Bihar State Government with the districts of Gaya, Nawada, Aurangabad and Jehanabad. All these districts were at the level of sub-division when the Gaya district was created in 1865.

Gaya has seen three districts partitioned off from its territory: Aurangabad and Nawada in 1976, and Jehanabad in 1988.

It is currently a part of the Red Corridor.
