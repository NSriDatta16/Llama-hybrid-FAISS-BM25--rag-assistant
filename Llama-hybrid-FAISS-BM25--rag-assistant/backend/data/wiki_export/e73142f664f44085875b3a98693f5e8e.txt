St Finian's Primary School (1901 - 1989) (Irish: Bunscoil Naomh Fionán) was a Roman Catholic primary school located in the Falls Road area of West Belfast near Dunville Park. It was named after Saint Finnian of Clonard and was run by the De La Salle Christian Brothers.

Due to falling student numbers the school closed in the 1980s.

Since 2004 the building has been occupied by the Irish-language primary school Gaelscoil an Lonnáin. There is also a Naíscoil an Lonnáin located in the facility for pre-school children.  In 2016, the Board of Governors proposed that it relocate to the former site of St Comgall's School in Divis Street but this was not approved.
