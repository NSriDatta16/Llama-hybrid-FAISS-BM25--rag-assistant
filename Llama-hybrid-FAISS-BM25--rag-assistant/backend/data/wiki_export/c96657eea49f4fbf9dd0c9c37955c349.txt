Melinda M. Snodgrass (born November 27, 1951) is an American science fiction writer for print and television. In February 2021 Melinda was the Screenwriting Guest of Honor and Keynote Speaker at the 39th annual Life, the Universe, & Everything professional science fiction and fantasy arts symposium.

Life 
Snodgrass lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In her spare time she is an equestrian who competes in dressage competition.

Snodgrass holds a degree in history from the University of New Mexico, as well as a law degree from the University of New Mexico School of Law. Her experience as a lawyer informed the Linnet Ellery series she published under the pen name Phillipa Bornikova (This Case Is Gonna Kill Me, 2012; Box Office Poison, 2013; Publish and Perish, 2018, all by Tor Books).

Career 
Snodgrass wrote several episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation while serving as the series' story editor during its second and third seasons. She has also contributed produced scripts for the series Odyssey 5, The Outer Limits, SeaQuest DSV, and Reasonable Doubts; she was also a consulting producer on The Profiler.

She has also written science fiction novels and short stories, notably the Circuit trilogy and is the co-editor and a frequent story contributor to George R. R. Martin's long-running Wild Cards shared world series.

Snodgrass helped recover a version of the award-winning Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Measure of a Man" by saving an old VHS cassette. This allowed a new version to be reconstructed from existing film shots, and an extended cut with 13 minutes of additional footage was released in HD in 2012.
