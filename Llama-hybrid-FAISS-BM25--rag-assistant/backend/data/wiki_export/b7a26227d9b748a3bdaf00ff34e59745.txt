AutoDiana was a Greek truck manufacturer based in Thessaloniki, in business between 1975 and 1984. Its main product was the 'Unicar' truck. This robust vehicle had a payload of 1500Â kg and used  a Mercedes-Benz Diesel engine and Dodge axles (a version of the Dana 70). Its fate, along with similar Greek multi-purpose trucks, such as Petropoulos Unitrak, the Agricola, the Motoemil Autofarma, the Balkania Autotractor, the Namco Agricar, was sealed when a change of Greek law in 1984 modified taxes and duties for such farm vehicles. Production was terminated the same year ending a career of reasonable sales among customers in the Greek countryside.
