Route description

SR 262 begins at US 50 near Dillsboro in Dearborn County.  Going south, it crosses SR 62 after only a few hundred feet, then runs southeast.  After a few miles, it descends into the Laughery Creek Valley, crossing the creek into Ohio County. After turning eastward and passing through the unincorporated community of Milton, it ascends out of the valley. Both the approach and departure of the valley are fairly hazardous, with sharp curves and steep dropoffs. At about 7 miles, it reaches the top of the ridge, where the road straightens out for a distance of a mile. The western end of this stretch is marked by a four-way intersection in the unincorporated community of Pate, with Hartford Pike headed north, while Cass-Union Road heading south to SR 56 in Aberdeen. SR 262 then passes through a four-way stop in Cofield Corner with Salem Ridge Road headed north east, and Palmer Road headed south. The road then descends into the Arnold Creek Valley, which is also a curvy stretch of road, but lacks the steep dropoffs of the Laughery Creek section.  The road enters the town of Rising Sun following Main Street, passing through a residential area of town. SR 262 terminates at an intersection between Main Street and High Street (SR 56) in the town. SR 56 turns onto Main Street for one block, before turning south and continuing towards Vevay and Madison. Indiana Department of Transportation surveys in 2015 showed that the highest traffic levels along SR 262 were the 3,352 vehicles daily in the Rising Sun; the lowest count was 514 vehicles per day in the area of Hartford Pike.
