In the Fishtank 10 is a 2003 EP by Motorpsycho and Jaga Jazzist Horns, recorded in 2002 during their European tour and released by the Konkurrent label in 2003. Motorpsycho did a handful of gigs with the horn section of Jaga Jazzist and used the opportunity to record their addition to the Fishtank series.

The style differs heavily from both Motorpsycho and Jaga Jazzist records, consisting of mainly jazz fusion. The first three tracks can be described as rather soothing, with track 2 (a reworking of the song from Angels and Daemons at Play) as a highlight. "Theme de Yoyo", a cover version of the Art Ensemble of Chicago song, steps partly into free jazz and "Tristano" is built around a hypnotic bassline (a recurring trademark of Motorpsycho) and is nearly 21 minutes long, making it the second-longest studio track the band has recorded (the longest being the title track of Little Lucid Moments).

Although this release runs over 46 minutes, it is still regarded as an EP due to the number of songs, the use of a re-worked older song and a cover tune.
