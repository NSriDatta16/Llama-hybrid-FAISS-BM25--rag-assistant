Browne is a variant of the English surname Brown, meaning "brown-haired" or "brown-skinned". It may sometimes be derived from French le Brun with similar meaning. The Mac an Bhreitheamhnaigh clan of County Donegal have anglicized as Browne since about 1800.
The name has also been used throughout North America as an anglicization of the Spanish surname Pardo.
