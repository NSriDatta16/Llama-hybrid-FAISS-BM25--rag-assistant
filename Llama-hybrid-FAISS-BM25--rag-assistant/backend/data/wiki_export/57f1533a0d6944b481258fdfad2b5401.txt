T Records was the record label imprint used solely by the Thompson Twins in the UK for their first 2 albums and corresponding singles.

The band had previously released two 7" singles independently: "Squares And Triangles" (RANK1) and "She's In Love With Mystery" (LATE1). However, they are reissued on this label in 1981. After the 2nd album, T Records was absorbed into Arista Records, where the band continued releasing albums & singles.

UK reissues did not use the T Records imprint, and the singles and both albums were released under Arista Records & other imprints in other markets.
