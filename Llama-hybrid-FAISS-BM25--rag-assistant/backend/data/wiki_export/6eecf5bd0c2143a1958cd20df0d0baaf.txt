Archaeology 
Archaeological excavations in 2010, by Argyll Archaeology, in advance of the development of the European Marine Science Park found evidence that people were also living in the area from the Neolithic to the Early Historic periods. The archaeologists discovered funerary pyres, and an infant burial, that were in use for several generations during the Late Iron Age and a farmstead in use sometime between the late 7th to 9th centuries AD. The end of activity on the site  roughly coincides with documented attacks on Iona by Norse invaders in 795, 802, 806 and 825. A Norse presence in the areas was found in the form of a fragment of copper alloy Viking ring money by a metal detectorist before the excavation.
