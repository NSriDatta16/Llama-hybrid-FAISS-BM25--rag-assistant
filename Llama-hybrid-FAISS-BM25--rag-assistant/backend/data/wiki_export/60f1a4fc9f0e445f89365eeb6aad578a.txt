History
Araçu began on the ranch owned by José Jacinto da Silva, where there was a cemetery built in 1911.  In 1912 Silva donated part of his land for the building of a chapel.  From 1925 to 1930 with the arrival of the families of Antônio Camargo and João Faria, the settlement known as São Sebastião do Salobro, began to grow.  In 1935 it belonged to the municipality of  Itauçu and in 1941 it became a district with the name Araçu, a Tupi term that means "Terra Grande" (Large Land).  In 1958 it was dismembered from Itauçu and became a municipality.  Source: Sepin
