The following is a list of notable first ascents of the summits of major mountains around the world, in chronological order. 

The list does not include the first ascent of new routes to previously climbed mountain summits.  For example, this list contains the first ascent of the summit of the Eiger in 1858, but not the more famous first ascent of the north face of the Eiger in 1938.
