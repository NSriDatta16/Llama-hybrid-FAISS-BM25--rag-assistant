Robert Dickinson (born 23 July 1965) is a British musician, multi-instrumentalist, and singer-songwriter previously of the band Catherine Wheel. Dickinson was raised in Norfolk, England, and is the paternal cousin of Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson. He is now a solo artist and the founder and creative director of Singer Vehicle Design since 2009, which performs restoration and modification of client vehicles.

Career
While a member of Catherine Wheel from 1990 to 2000, Dickinson co-wrote and sang lead vocals on several hit singles. However, after the 2000 release of Catherine Wheel's last album, Wishville, the group disbanded.

Dickinson contributed vocals to two tracks on The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex album, Life Begins Again, which was released in January 2005.  Dickinson returned to the music scene in September 2005 with the release of his debut solo album, Fresh Wine for the Horses. The album includes tracks written by Dickinson while a member of Catherine Wheel, as well as newer material.  The release was supported by a tour of small venues across the United States and Canada, where Dickinson performed intimate acoustic sets of both Catherine Wheel and solo material. Dickinson ultimately moved to United States in the same year.

In February 2006, he discussed his new solo record and his career with Catherine Wheel in an interview with Auralgasms.com prior to his solo set in Ferndale, Michigan.

At the invitation of Marty Willson-Piper of The Church, Dickinson toured the US with The Church during July and August 2006, opening each show and joining the band on stage for two encores.

On 10 June 2008, Fresh Wine for the Horses was re-released by Universal/Fontana with the new song "The End of the World" and a bonus disc, "Nude", which features Dickinson's re-workings of six Catherine Wheel songs including "Black Metallic" and "Crank".

His song "The Storm" was featured on an episode of Discovery's series Deadliest Catch.
