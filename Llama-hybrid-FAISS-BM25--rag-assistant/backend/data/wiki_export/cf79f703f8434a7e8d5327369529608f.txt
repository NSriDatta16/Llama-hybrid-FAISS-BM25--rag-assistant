Richard S. "Rick" Krebs is a role-playing game and simulation game designer.
His initial game design was in the early 1960s when he created simulation games using toothpicks, American plastic bricks, cardboard chits, bingo chips and the box-like design of his bed quilt (buildings). The periods covered by these rules began with medieval & fantasy knights, through gangster wars, and continued into modern warfare. His mother frequently commented that Rick used to get in trouble with the neighborhood kids, as he was always changing or making up new rules. Briefly, putting aside his toys and games, Krebs trained as a social/cultural/intellectual historian, and received a B.A. from Albright College in 1971. His senior thesis was on the biographer/journalist/historian, Burton J. Hendrick.
