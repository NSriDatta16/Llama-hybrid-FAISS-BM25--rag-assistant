Brighton as part of the film industry
Brighton played a part in the early development of filmmaking and cinematography as a home and work-place of William Friese-Greene, an early pioneer of the art (credited by some with its invention).

In the 1890s, early filmmaker George Albert Smith lived and built a studio in neighbouring Hove, now a part of the city of Brighton and Hove.

Brighton's Duke of York's Picturehouse has been in operation since 22 September 1910, making it the oldest purpose built and continually operating cinema in Britain.
