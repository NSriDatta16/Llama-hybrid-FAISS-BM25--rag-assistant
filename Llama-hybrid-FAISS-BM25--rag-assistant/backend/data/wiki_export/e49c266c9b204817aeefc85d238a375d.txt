Background
The song is in the chanson style and features Jürgens wondering why bad things need to happen, such as flowers dying and the object of his affections ignoring him.

The song was recorded in English (first by Matt Monro, with later versions by Brenda Lee with Richard Williams, Peter Grant, Al Martino, Nancy Wilson and Timi Yuro among others), in Italian and in Spanish as "Vete por favor" by Matt Monro, on each occasion featuring similar sentiments.

Following the contest,  representative Matt Monro had a hit with his English-language version of "Warum nur, warum?", entitled "Walk Away" (lyrics by Don Black, with whom Monro attended the Eurovision contest). Monro came second in the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest with the Tony Hatch song,  "I Love the Little Things".
