Apple Assembly Line was a monthly newsletter edited by Bob Sander-Cederlof from October 1980 through May 1988. The publisher was S-C Software Corporation based in Dallas, Texas.

Overview
The newsletter focused on assembly language programming for the Apple II personal computer. Initially, the programs were only written for the MOS 6502 microprocessor, but this expanded to the 65C02, 65802, and 65816 microprocessors as the Apple II family continued to develop.

Sander-Cederlof used the S-C Macro Assembler, which he had authored and sold himself, to publish his programs. At its peak, the newsletter had over 1000 subscribers–mainly those learning to program in assembly language–with issues being mailed all over the world.
