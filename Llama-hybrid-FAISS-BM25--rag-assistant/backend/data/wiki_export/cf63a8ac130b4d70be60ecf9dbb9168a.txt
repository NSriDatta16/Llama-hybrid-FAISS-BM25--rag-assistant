Story
The first episode begins with the introduction of Ah Bao, who narrates his story. Abandoned by his own parents as a child, Ah Bao (Li Nanxing) grew up with gangsters and often got into trouble. At the age of 21, Ah Bao went to jail after his friend (Zheng Geping) and girlfriend (Joey Swee) betrayed him during a robbery he took part in. While in jail, Ah Bao plotted his revenge against the people who betrayed him.

Upon his release from prison, he discovered that his friend is now intellectually disabled and that his friend's ex-girlfriend has remarried. He learns that the couple has left behind children, who are abused by their foster family. Feeling sorry for them, Ah Bao decides to take care of the children.

Ah Bao ends up renting a place from Shushu (Huang Biren), a chicken rice seller, who is infamous for her weird temper. Living under the same roof, Ah Bao learns that Shushu's temperament is due to her husband's (Huang Yiliang) betrayal when she had breast cancer. As time goes by, the couple discovers the nicer side of each other and Ah Bao learns about trust again.

Just when life seems to be turning better for Ah Bao, he discovers the truth about his downfall ten years ago. He decides to uncover the mastermind. Is Ah Bao taking a wrong step in his life again?
