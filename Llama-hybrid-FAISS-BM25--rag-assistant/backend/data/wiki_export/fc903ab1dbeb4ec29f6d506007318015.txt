History
The island used to be controlled by the Dutch when it was known as Varken Eiland  or Hog Island, so named due to it being inhabited by a large number of wild hogs. Then in 1814 with the cessation of the Napoleonic Wars the British gained control of the Dutch colonies: Demerara, Berbice, and Essequibo, leaving the Dutch with Suriname until 1975. The British had decided to keep the name of the island as the Dutch did "Hogg Island".

Windmill
A windmill is located on the former plantation Lyksburg. The windmill is the only remaining mill in Guyana, and was constructed in 1768. The National Trust of Guyana restored the mill in 2010, and it has been declared a national monument.
