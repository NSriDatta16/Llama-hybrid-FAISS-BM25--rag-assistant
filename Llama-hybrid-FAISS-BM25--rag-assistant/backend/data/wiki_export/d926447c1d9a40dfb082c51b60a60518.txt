The infratrochlear nerve is a branch of the nasociliary nerve (itself a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (CN V1)) in the orbit. It exits the orbit inferior to the trochlea of superior oblique. It provides sensory innervation to structures of the orbit and skin of adjacent structures.

Structure 
The nasociliary nerve terminates by bifurcating into the infratrochlear and the anterior ethmoidal nerves. The infratrochlear nerve travels anteriorly in the orbit along the upper border of the medial rectus muscle and underneath the trochlea of the superior oblique muscle. It exits the orbit medially and divides into small sensory branches.

Distribution 
The infratrochlear nerve provides sensory innervation to the skin of the eyelids, the conjunctiva, lacrimal sac, lacrimal caruncle, and the side of the nose superior to the medial canthus.

Communications 
The infratrochlear nerve receives a descending communicating branch from the supratrochlear nerve.

Etymology 
The infratrochlear nerve is named after a structure it passes under. Infratrochlear means "below the trochlea". The term trochlea means "pulley" in Latin. Specifically, the trochlea refers to a fibrocartilaginous loop at the superomedial surface of the orbit called the trochlea, through which the tendon of the superior oblique muscle passes.
