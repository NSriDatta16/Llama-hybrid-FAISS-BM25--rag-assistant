The temple in Madrid is a highly visible symbol of the church's presence in Spain. During the open house, over 100,000 community members and government officials toured the temple, including King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía.

LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley went to Spain to dedicate the Madrid Spain Temple and had his third visit with the King and Queen. During the visit, Hinckley presented them with a special gift created by well-known Spanish artists: a Lladró figurine of the Christus, modeled after the original by Bertel Thorvaldsen. Jose Lladro, president of the Lladro Company, had personally delivered the first five issues of the figurine to Hinckley at the temple site. One of the five figurines is now on permanent display in the temple foyer.

Hinckley dedicated the temple on 19 March 1999. The Madrid Spain Temple has a total of , four ordinance rooms, and four sealing rooms.

In 2020, the Madrid Spain Temple was closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
