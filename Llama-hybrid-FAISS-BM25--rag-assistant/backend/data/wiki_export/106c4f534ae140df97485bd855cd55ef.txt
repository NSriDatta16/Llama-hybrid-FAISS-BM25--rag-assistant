She finished her secondary education in 1958, and graduated from the University of Oslo with the cand.jur. degree in 1963. After seven years as a businesswoman in Drammen and Oslo, she was a police superintendent in Drammen from 1971 to 1977. The years 1973 and 1976 were exceptions; she served one year as deputy judge in Kongsberg District Court and one year as a lawyer in Drammen.

Røkke started her political career in Drammen city council from 1971 to 1979. She chaired Drammen Conservative Women's League from 1974 to 1975, later the county league from 1976 to 1979 and the Conservative Women's League of Norway from 1979 to 1985.

She was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Buskerud in 1977, and was re-elected in 1981 and 1985. She was a member of the Standing Committee on Justice. From 1981 through 1985 she was a member of Willoch's First Cabinet as Minister of Justice. Her seat in Parliament was in turn filled by Øivin Skappel Fjeldstad, Hallgrim Berg and Odd Kallerud.

She then returned to Parliament for her second real term, serving in the Standing Committee on Defence and Standing Committee on Social Affairs until 1989. From 1987 she was also a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly. In October 1987 she was named as the County Governor of Vestfold, a position she assumed in 1989 after her parliamentary career. She served until her professional retirement in 2010.
